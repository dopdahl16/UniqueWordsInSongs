All the old paintings on the tombs
They do the sand dance don't you know
If they move too quick oh whey oh
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles oh whey oh
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with their hookah pipes say
Ay oh whey oh ay oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian

Blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves oh whey oh
You drop your drink then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings oh whey oh
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
Ay oh whey oh ay oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street bend your back
Shift your arm then you pull it back
Life is hard you know oh whey oh
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance oh whey oh
Spin the clubs cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know oh whey oh
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
Ay oh whey oh ay oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian

Walk like an Egyptian

I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh I hope that it won't end though


Alone uhh
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you uhh
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone


You don't know how long I have waited
And I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone uhh
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you uhh
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone


How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone
Alone alone


Alone uhh
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you uhh
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone


Alone
Alone alone

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "I Wanna Dance with Somebody Who Loves Me" by Whitney Houston:

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls loneliness calls

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody who somebody who
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby
Don'tcha wanna dance with me boy
Hey don'tcha wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

Don'tcha wanna dance say you wanna dance
Don'tcha wanna dance
Don'tcha wanna dance say you wanna dance


Looking in your eyes I see a paradise  
This world that I found is too good to be true  
Standing here beside you want so much to give you  
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you  

Let them say we're crazy I don't care about that  
Put your hand in my hand baby don't ever look back  
Let the world around us just fall apart  
Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart  

And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothing's gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
We'll still have each other  
Nothing's gonna stop us nothing's gonna stop us now  

I'm so glad I found you I'm not gonna lose you  
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you  
Take it to the good times see it through the bad times  
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do  

Let them say we're crazy what do they know  
Put your arms around me baby don't ever let go  
Let the world around us just fall apart  
Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart  

And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothing's gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
We'll still have each other  
Nothing's gonna stop us nothing's gonna stop us  

Ooh all that I need is you  
All that I ever need  
And all that I want to do  
Is hold you forever forever and ever  

And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothing's gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
We'll still have each other  
Nothing's gonna stop us nothing's gonna stop us  

And we can build this dream together  
Standing strong forever  
Nothing's gonna stop us now  
And if this world runs out of lovers  
We'll still have each other  
Nothing's gonna stop us nothing's gonna stop us now  

Hey baby I know hey baby nothing's gonna stop us  
Hey baby woo hey baby woo
All right here are the uncensored lyrics of "C'est La Vie" by Robbie Nevil:

Got a job that's okay
But they've got me workin' night and day
Punchin' in punchin' out
Is this really what life's all about
Spending weekends doing nothing special
Got a good time job and an evening s** life
I don't need a TV
I don't need a radio
I've got a good time job and an evening s** life
I don't need nothin' else but Robbie
C'est la vie as they say
In French or should I say
Au revoir as we say
In English or should I say
Goodbye
I don't need nothin' else but Robbie
Standing in line marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun he says "Get a job"

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah but don't you believe them

Said "Hey little boy you can't go
Where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do"
Said "Hey old man how can you stand
To think that way
Did you really think about it
Before you made the rules"

He said "Son that's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah but don't you believe them"

Well they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
Because the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar no

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah but don't you believe them

Oooohhh
That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah but don't you believe them

Repeat and fade
Well shake down break down take down
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Break down take down you're busted
Let down your guard honey just a little bit
You know it ain't easy
When you gotta live from day to day
There ain't nothin' wrong with makin' a little hay
Repeat chorus
Break down take down now it's all gone
Spent my money waitin' all night
For the song to come along that's right
Repeat chorus
Repeat 1st verse
Repeat chorus
Repeat 1st verse
Para bailar la bamba
Para bailar la bamba
Se necesita una poca de gracia
Una poca de gracia pa' mi pa' ti
Y arriba y arriba y arriba y arriba
Por ti seré por ti seré por ti seré

Yo no soy marinero
Yo no soy marinero
Soy capitán soy capitán
Soy capitán
Bamba bamba

Para subir al cielo
Para subir al cielo
Se necesita una escalera larga
Una escalera larga y otra cortita
Una escalera corta pa' ti pa' mi
Y arriba y arriba y arriba y arriba
Por ti seré por ti seré por ti seré

Yo no soy marinero
Yo no soy marinero
Soy capitán soy capitán

Bamba bamba

There is freedom within there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now hey now don't dream it's over
Hey now hey now when the world comes in
They come they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now hey now don't dream it's over
Hey now hey now when the world comes in
They come they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Hey now hey now don't let them see you cry
Hey now hey now when the world comes in
They come they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Don't let them win
They come they come
Don't let them win
They come they come
Oh they come they come
Hey now hey now
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Always" by Atlantic Starr:

Girl you are to me all that a woman should be

And I dedicate my life to you always

A love like yours is rare it must have been sent from up above

And I know you'll stay this way for always

And we both know that our love will grow

And forever it will be you and me yeah

Ooh your life is sun chasing all the rain away

When you come around you bring brighter days

You're the perfect one for me and you forever will be

And I will love you so for always

Come with me my sweet let's go make a family

And they will bring us joy for always

Ooh babe there's something that I want to say

But words sometimes get in the way

I just want you to know how I feel inside

And why I'll love you forever 'cause you are my lady

You're everything I need and more

You are my lady oh yeah listen to me

I'm so glad we're together

Come on baby let's stay this way forever

Ooh girl I need you I'll never never let you go

Ooh baby you're the one the one I need

Girl you're the one I need you oh baby

Hasta la vista baby
Maybe if you loved me I woulda stayed
But you didn't so I'll be on my way
Boy I know you're used to winning
But you ain't gonna score again
'Cause you're off-side baby modern


You thought that I would be lonely
Sad and desperate for your love
But I had no trouble finding 
Someone who was a real man


Looking for a new love baby
A new love yeah yeah yeah
Looking for a new love baby
A new love yeah yeah yeah


Now that I've escaped how dare you say
That I should take you back you crossed the line first
You've given me oh so much love
You're telling me you miss my touch


You thought that I would be lonely
Sad and desperate for your love
But I had no trouble finding 
Someone who was a real man


Looking for a new love baby
A new love yeah yeah yeah
Looking for a new love baby

Now I see the mistake I made

Looking for a new love baby
A new love yeah yeah yeah
Looking for a new love baby
A new love yeah yeah yeah
Head to toe I know
Today started when I woke up this morning
You gotta believe me when I say

Please give me all your attention
Cause you're the one I need
All my dreams turned to visions
I need you to turn them to real Baby
You got me saying:
*Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Head to toe I know
Emily D West enhanced me to keep doing
continuation of the chorus*
Feel it in my soul
Now I lose control
I'm so excited and I just can't fight it
Don't hide it and don't you deny it
There's something about you baby
This feeling that you drive me crazy
Oh oh oh
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
And I know I know I know I know I know
I want you; I want you

I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you

I have run I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
I was burning inside her

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I believe in the kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes I'm still running

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame you know I believe it

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

Now I've had the time of my life
No I never felt like this before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you


'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you
I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me


We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical fantasy
Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly

So we take each other's hand
'Cause we seem to understand the urgency
Just remember


You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love because


I've had the time of my life
No I never felt this way before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you


'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door
Till I've found the truth
And I owe it all to you




Hey baby


With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know


So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control


Yes I know what's on your mind
When you say "Stay with me tonight"


Just remember


You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love


Because I've had the time of my life
I've felt this way before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you


'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door
Till I've found the truth
And I owe it all to you


I've had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door
Till I've found the truth
And I owe it all to you

We made a promise to stay together
Did it for love we tried to make it last forever
We climbed a mountain and reached the top
We're so close but then it all came to a stop


Baby the next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
I'll know what to do
Baby the next time I fall in love
The next time I fall
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It will be with you
Amy Grant:
Now I don't want to fall for someone new
'Cause baby I still have a lot of love for you
Though we're apart I know my heart is still with you
And someday soon I know that you'll feel it too woah


Baby the next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
I'll know what to do
Baby the next time I fall in love
The next time I fall
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It will be with you


The stars are shining so bright tonight
But when you're around they shine much brighter
So don't let it end baby we could have so much more
Who knows what we'll find what we're looking for


Baby the next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
I'll know what to do
Baby the next time I fall in love
The next time I fall
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It will be with you


I'm so glad I found you I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you oh whoa oh
Next time I fall I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall it will be with you
I'll know what to do
It will be with you


Baby the next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
I'll know what to do
Baby the next time I fall in love
The next time I fall
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It will be with you
Verse 1:
Watch out
I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me want to hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you’d see
My desire burning inside of me

Pre-Chorus:
But you choose to look the other way
I’ve had to work much harder than this
For something I want don't try to resist me

Chorus:
Open your heart to me baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me darlin’
I'll give you love if you turn the key

Verse 2:
I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice

Pre-Chorus:
So you choose to look the other way
Well I've got something to say
Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying you’ve got to…

Chorus:
Open your heart to me baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me darlin’
I'll give you love if you turn the key

Bridge:
Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number
Ah open your heart I'll make you love me
It's not that hard if you just turn the key

Chorus:
Open your heart to me baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me darlin’
I'll give you love if you turn the key

Outro:
Open your heart with the key
Open your heart with the key
Open your heart with the key
Open your heart with the key
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  

I keep looking for something I can't get  
Broken hearts lie all around me  
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this  

Her diary it sits by the bedside table  
The curtains are closed the cat's in the cradle  
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this  

Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  

I should've walked away I should've walked away  
Is there any just cause for feeling like this  
On the surface I'm a name on a list  
I've lost and found it's my final mistake  
She's loving by proxy no give and all take  
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times  

Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  

It was a long hot night  
She made it easy she made it feel right  
But now it's over the moment has gone  
I followed my hands not my head I know I was wrong  

Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  

Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been some kind of kiss  
I should've walked away I should've walked away
Verse 1:
Something in the moonlight catches my eye
The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow so
Give me love give me heart and soul

You never let me cross to the other side
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Oh yes you will you give me love give me heart and soul

Verse 2:
You never let me cross to the other side
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Oh yes you will you give me love give me heart and soul

Chorus:
I want a soul shake
I need your love to break this feeling
I want a soul shake
I need your love to break this feeling

Verse 3:
You never let me cross to the other side
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Oh yes you will you give me love give me heart and soul

Chorus:
I want a soul shake
I need your love to break this feeling
I want a soul shake
I need your love to break this feeling

Outro:
Give me love give me heart and soul
Give me love give me heart and soul
Give me love give me heart and soul
This is a bit tricky since the lyrics to "Control" by Janet Jackson don't inherently include any explicit language but here are the lyrics without any additional commentary or censorship:

This is a story about control my control
Control of what I say control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way my way

I hope you enjoy this as much as I do
Are we ready
I am
'Cause it's all about control and I've got lots of it

When I was 17 I did what people told me uhh
Did what my father said and let my mother mold me uhh
But that was long ago

I'm in control Never gonna stop
Control To get what I want
Control I like to have a lot
Control Now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive I thought it would be easy
Now I know I've got to take

Control Now I've got a lot ooh wee
Control To get what I want ooh wee
Control I'm never gonna stop ooh wee
Control Now I'm all grown up

Jam ooh wee uh
Revenge ahhh
Fight back ooh wee
Get some ahhh

When I was 17 I did what people told me
And did what my father said and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago

I'm in control ooh wee Never gonna stop
Control ooh wee To get what I want
Control ooh wee I like to have a lot
Control ooh wee Now I'm all grown up

Free at last Out here on my own yeah-e-yeah

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "U Got the Look" by Prince:

Here we are folks the dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me have you got the look
You walked in I woke up
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough baby
You got that look
Color you peach and black
Color me taken aback
Crucial I think I want 'cha
Crucial I think I love 'cha
Ain't that a bitch babe
You got that look
Oh yeah
Girl versus boy in the World Series of love
Tossin' love-bombs from above
Tell me have you got the look yeah
You walked in I woke up
I've never seen a such a pretty girl in a such a tough world
You're everything I like
Together we're gonna get that look alright
And if we die tomorrow ooh
What'd say you'd give for another chance
So don't say you love me don't say you love me
Don't say you love me I'll just throw up
It's just that you're the only one I've been dreaming of
I could give a damn if you I could give a damn if you don't give a damn don't give a damn
My love my love is ticking clock
Beats like beats a clock like beats a clock time
And if your love's not all it could be
What you'll what have what to set me free
What you're what sayin' what is not too strong a statement
If you want to play with me
You better learn how how
Honk your horn yeah
Look here we are folks
If you wanna make that love connection
All you gotta do is just give me a little time
All I want is a little time to make up my mind
Honey please can't you see
Don't you just wanna be
With a love like mine oh
You know you wanna-g wanna-g
Dance until you're hot
You know you wanna you wanna-g
Lay in my funk and get ah hot
You got the look baby
You got the look
What in the world am I gonna ever do
you got that you got that you got that look
Look at you What're you
you got that you got that you got that look
gonna do to me Ah Huh
you got that you got that you got that look
Look at me What ever
you got that you got that you got that look
happened to your nasty attitude
you got that look
Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight  
Someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight  
Somewhere out there someone's saying a prayer  
That we'll find one another in that big somewhere out there  

And even though I know how very far apart we are  
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star  
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby  
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky  

Somewhere out there if love can see us through  
Then we'll be together somewhere out there  
Out where dreams come true  

Somewhere out there if love can see us through  
Then we'll be together somewhere out there  
Out where dreams come true
Verse 1:
I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Verse 2:
Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
They're burning into the night

Chorus:
There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is a land of confusion

Verse 3:
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Verse 4:
I remember long ago
When the sun was shining
And all the stars were bright all through the night
In the wake up this madness as I held you tight

Chorus:
So many men so many people
Making so many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is a land of confusion

Bridge:
Now I won't be sitting here alone
A million miles away
I think I'll take a good look deep inside
And see what I can find

Verse 5:
Oh no no
They say it's all doom and gloom
But I don't know
I see a light in the darkening room
Babies in the sun
We know that they are the ones
Who make the future
And they make it real bright
And most importantly

Chorus:
There's too many men too many people
Making too many problems
And there's not much love to go around
Can't you see this is a land of confusion
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
Verse 1:
I met a fan dancer 
Down in South Side of Birmingham 
She was running from a fat man 
Selling salvation in his hand 
Now he's trying to save me 
'Cause I'm becoming a bigger fan 

Chorus:
Jacob's Ladder 
Went up and down 
I am standing on the solid ground 
Hoo-ah 
My soul's in flight 
Like an eagle might 
Jacob's Ladder 
Leaping toward the light 

Verse 2:
I am climbing Jacob's ladder 
With the rhythm in my head 
Every rung goes higher and higher 
I am climbing Jacob's ladder 
With a sermon in my shoe 
Every rung goes higher and higher 
Soldier let your head down 

Chorus:
Jacob's Ladder 
Went up and down 
I am standing on the solid ground 
Hoo-ah 
My soul's in flight 
Like an eagle might 
Jacob's Ladder 
Leaping toward the light 

Verse 3:
Brother do you love her 
Do you need a helping hand 
Would you be a backslider Don't you do it 
Would you love to leave this land You better not 
Soldier let your head down 

Chorus:
Jacob's Ladder 
Went up and down 
I am standing on the solid ground 
Hoo-ah 
My soul's in flight 
Like an eagle might 
Jacob's Ladder 
Leaping toward the light 

Verse 4:
There is none like-a the righteous man 
No no no no no no 
Not one not one not one no no no 
Not one no no no no no 
Not one no no no not one 

Chorus:
Jacob's Ladder 
Went up and down 
I am standing on the solid ground 
Hoo-ah 
My soul's in flight 
Like an eagle might 
Jacob's Ladder 
Leaping toward the light

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "You Got It All" by The Jets:


Candlelight and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger


Be for real don't be a stranger
We can achieve it we can achieve it
Come a little bit closer baby
Get it on get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one


I see a sparkle in your eyes
A chance for love a chance for lies
Come hold me now before it slips away
Dying to meet you so tell me your name


We can hear ourselves and feel together real
Love is a temple love's a higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you've got
'Cause all you've got is hurt


One love one blood one life you got to do what you should
One life with each other sisters and my brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other carry each other


Oh you got it all over him
You got me over him and I'm better off dead
All the love all the love that I've found
I will never find it again

I understand your request and will provide the uncensored lyrics of "Luka" by Suzanne Vega without any additional labels commentary censorship or information:

My name is Luka
I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes I think you've seen me before
If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

I think it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud
They only hit until you cry
After that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore

Yes I think I'm okay
Walked into the door again
Well if you ask that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway
I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken nothing thrown
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am

My name is Luka
I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes I think you've seen me before
If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Yes I did boy ooh

They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Ooh yes I did boy

So you're finally leaving me
And I'm not sorry to see you go
I'm tired of feeling unimportant
And I don't suppose you know

I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Yes I did boy ooh

I hope you find somebody
Who can love you like I did
But if you think that you can't make it
Feel free to come on back and get it

I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Yes I did boy ooh

I don't want to see you again
And I don't want to feel this pain
I'm sick and tired of your complaining
When you're the one who's to blame

I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Yes I did boy ooh

So don't come crawling back to me
When you get what you deserve
Don't act surprised if you hear it
'Cause you're the one who spread the word

I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Yes I did boy ooh

I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Yes I did boy ooh

I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Yes I did boy ooh
For you the uncensored lyrics of "Songbird" by Kenny G are:

*Instrumental only as Songbird is an instrumental piece and has no lyrics*
Verse 1:
Como puede ser verdad
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday not far away

Chorus:
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Verse 2:
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Chorus:
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Bridge:
I want to be where the sun
Warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can
Watch them go by
Beautiful faces no cares in this
World
Where a girl loves a boy and a boy
Loves a girl

Chorus:
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Outro:
La la la la la la la

In France a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called "The Disciples"
High on crack and totin' a machine gun

Time
Time
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it
And yet we're sending people to the Moon
In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doin' horse it's June

Time
Time
It's silly no
When a rocket ship explodes and everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy unless a man truly dies
Oh why
Time
Time

Baby make a speech Star Wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time
Time
Is it silly no
When a rocket blows and everybody still wants to fly ah
Some say a man ain't happy truly
Until a man truly dies oh why
Sign o' the times
Time
Time
Sign o' the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love get married have a baby
We'll call him "Nate"
If it's a boy
Time
Time
Time
If it's a boy
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Change of Heart" by Cyndi Lauper:

Here I am just like I said I would be  
I'm your friend just like you think it should be  
Did you think I would stand here and lie  
As our moment was passing us by  
Oh I am here  


No my hearts not breaking  
This is one mistake I've learned to make  
I won't deny the truth  
I'm just afraid of losing you  
This one mistake  
Has caused a chain reaction  
But I'm afraid to turn back now  
Cause I'm scared of losing you  


I can see you're disappointed  
By the way you look at me  
And I'm sorry that I'm not  
The woman you thought I'd be  
Yes I've made my mistakes  
But listen and understand  
My mistakes are no worse than yours  
Just because I'm a woman  


So when you look at me  
Don't feel sorry for yourself  
Just think of all the shame  
You might have brought somebody else  
Just let me try to explain  
What I'm going through  
I just need you to understand  
I'm trying to be a better woman for you  


Now all I need is a little time  
To get behind this sun  
And cast my weight  
Behind this climb  


And I will  
So if you still want me  
You gotta show me love  
Words are not enough  
I went through  


So now I'm standing and  
Looking at you I'm  
Wondering what you're gonna do  


To make a change  


Oh you need a change of heart  
Change of heart  
Have a heart  
Change of heart  
Have a heart  


Oh you need a change of heart  
Change of heart  
Have a heart  
Change of heart  
Have a heart  


Oh you need a  
You need a  
Change of heart  
Have a heart  


Oh you need a change of heart  
Change of heart  
Have a heart  


Now that I'm stronger  
I've figured out  
How this world turns cold  
And it breaks through my soul  
And I know  
I'll find deep inside me  
I can be the one  


I will never let you fall  
I'll stand up with you forever  
I'll be there for you through it all  
Even if saving you sends me to heaven  


Cause you're my you're my  
My true love my whole heart  
Please don't throw that away  


Cause I'm here  
For you  
Please don't walk away  
And please tell me  
You'll stay stay  


Use me as you will  
Pull my strings just for a thrill  
And I know I'll be okay  
Though my skies are turning gray
Oooh baby doll
Woman flesh to fantasy
Yeah I know she got you hot
I can see you shivers
Boiling hot
She's got you hooked up
No doubt about it
Ohhh
To be a lover
You gotta fire
Satisfaction that you need
Don't try to fight it
Just get excited
There ain't no way you'r gonna leave
No way you're gonna leave
Ooh I wanna hold you baby
I got the need for you
Oh woman I got to seek

To be a lover

Satisfaction that you need
Don't try to fight it
Just get excited
There ain't no way you'r gonna leave

Ooh when you're home
Ain't no need in checkin'
Ain't enough good to go for a stash
No to your love
No never gonna get it
Ain't no hiding love no stash

The song "Mandolin Rain" by Bruce Hornsby and the Range goes as follows:

The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you got 'til you lose it all again

Hearts break and hearts mend
Love still hurts visions blend
Into dreams of a cold dark night

So oh mandolin
Wind cry a sad old song
But I wither away
And like a bird of prey
She was gone

An' now I'm alone
With the hearth and the home
And the days that seem shorter
The nights that seem so long

Letters I've written
Never meaning to send
Beauty I'd always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say any more
'Cause I love you more than ever
Now that the past is gone
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid
Oh I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling darling
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

And darling darling
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand by me
Stand by me yeah

Darling darling
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand by me
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand by me
Stand by me

Darling darling
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand by me
Stand by me
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you true love won't desert you
You know I still love you though we touched and went our separate ways

Troubled times caught between confusion and pain
Pain pain
Distant eyes promise was just a lie
Lost and gone lost and gone

Lost and gone lost and gone
When we touch we touched the heart of the soul
Two lovers and no one else will ever know
We were the best I know you know
And though we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you true love won't desert you
You know I still love you though it touched and went our separate ways
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you true love won't desert you
No no
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you true love won't desert you
Na na na
Ooh the steam is rising

You know when smokey sings

I feel a chemical reaction

As he as he touches the screen

He's larger than life

And twice as natural

I wonder if this is

Fate or design

There is no denying

He's got a troubled mind

Inside his shell

Oh you wouldn't believe it

Inside his shell oh

You wouldn't believe it no no

When Smokey sings I hear violins

When Smokey sings I forget everything

As she's packing her things

As she's spreading her wings

The front door might slam

But the back door it rings

And another frustrating

No-moment flares up

and fades away

In flamboyant direction

For love or money

When Smokey sings I hear violins

When Smokey sings I forget everything

When Smokey sings I hear violins

When Smokey sings I forget everything

As she's packing her things

As she's spreading her wings

Round and around

Everything else fades away

When Smokey sings when Smokey sings

When Smokey sings I hear violins

When Smokey sings I forget everything

When Smokey sings I hear violins

When Smokey sings I forget everything

When Smokey sings

When Smokey sings I hear violins

When Smokey sings I forget everything

When Smokey sings I hear violins

When Smokey sings I forget everything
At night when you turn off all the lights

In bed throw the covers on your head
You pretend like you are dead
But I know it
The rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you tonight
At the party when you turn off the lights
There's no place that you can hide
Oh no the rhythm is gonna get'cha

Tonight tonight the rhythm is gonna get'cha
Tonight tonight the rhythm is gonna get'cha
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Big Time" by Peter Gabriel:

I'm on my way I'm making it
I've got to make it show yeah
So much larger than life
I'm going to watch it growing

The place where I come from is a small town
They think so small they use small words
But not me I'm smarter than that
I worked it out I've been stretching my mouth

To let those big words come right out
I've had enough I'm getting out
To the city the big big city
I'll be a big noise with all the big boys

So much stuff I will own
And I will pray to a big god
As I kneel in the big church

Big time
I'm on my way I'm making it
Big time
Oh yes I've got to make it show yeah

Big time
Big time
So much larger than life

Big time
I'm going to watch it growing
Big time

My parties have all got the big names
And I greet them with the widest smile
Tell them how my life is one big adventure
And always they're amazed

When I show them round my house to my bed
I had it made like a mountain range
With a snow-white pillow for my big fat head
And my heaven will be a big heaven

And I will walk through the front door
Big time
I'm on my way I'm making it
Big time
Oh yes I've got to make it show yeah

Big time
Big time
So much larger than life

Big time
I'm going to watch it growing
Big time

Hey hey hey hey
Okay here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Finer Things" by Steve Winwood:

Oh the finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

I've been sad and have walked bitter streets alone
And come morning there's a good wind to blow me home
So time is a river rolling into nowhere
I will live while I can I will have my ever after

Oh the finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

Like a ghost out of time there's a man who would be king
And he's always searching cling to those finer things
So I've been caught up in fortunes that don't mean a thing
Failed in love and lost in life but I have found my feet again

Oh the finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

Oh the finest things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

Oh the finest things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be

All the bees and birds are flying
Ah never let go

Is this love or am I dreaming
This must be love 'cause it's really got a hold on me

A kind of love when you need it not too much
Most kinda love when you learn to share

Like an overdrive it's a mystery
Oh I'm glad that it's out of my way

This must be love 'cause it's really got a hold on me
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Diamonds" by Herb Alpert:

Diamonds
Diamonds
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no drugs
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no love

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no pills
All I need is music
To cure my ills

Diamonds
Diamonds
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no wealth
All I need is rhythm
To keep me in good health

I don't need no guru
I don't need no church
All I need is passion
To make my spirit lurch

Diamonds
Diamonds
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no faith
All I need is beauty
To keep me safe

I don't need no heaven
I don't need no hell
All I need is feeling
To keep me well

Diamonds
Diamonds
I don't need no diamonds
Looking out for love
In the night so still
Oh I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill
Looking out for love
In the night so still
Will you hold on to love
Or let it slip away
I hate to see the evening sun go down
I hate to see the evening sun go down
'Cause you're not around
What will I do if you never come back 
What will I do if you never return 
What will I do if you break my heart 
What will I do
Looking out for love
In the light of the moon
Oh but it's a long lonely journey
Out of the blues
You know I'm looking out for love
But I don't know where to start
Oh I know I'll find love
And hope it won't break my heart
I hate to see the evening sun go down
I hate to see the evening sun go down
'Cause you're not around
What will I do if you never come back 
What will I do if you never return 
What will I do if you break my heart 
What will I do
Midnight blue 
So lonely without you
Dreams come slow
But go so fast
You see her leaving
Tears on the sleeve of a man
Don't say a word
I'll understand
She's only acting sure of herself
She's only trying to forget
A lesson taught a long time ago
To a girl so young and so much in love
Now she doesn't know
What she's thinking of
But it's midnight blue
Oh oh midnight blue
Oh oh
Midnight blue
Oh oh midnight blue
Oh oh
You were the restless one
And you did not care
That I was the one
The one who was always there
So I'll be gone
When you wake up
And I'll be there
When you need me again
For each moment that we were together
Is worth a million tears
And a million dreams
Wouldn't be too much to pay
For the memories that we shared
For the laughter and the loving
Won't you think of me
In the silence of the night
Midnight blue
She'll keep you cool in the
Heat of the night
She'll keep you cool when you want
Her to
She'll keep you cool in the
Heat of the night
She'll keep you cool when you want
Her to
And oh I got nothing on my mind
Nothing to remember
Nothing to forget
And I've got nothing to regret
But I'm all tied up on the inside
No one knows quite what I've got
And I know that on the outside
What I used to be I'm not anymore
You know I've heard about people like me
But I never made the connection
They walk one road to set them free
And find they've gone the wrong direction
But there's no need for turning back
'Cause all roads lead to where I stand
And I believe I'll walk them all
No matter what I may have planned
Can you feel the passion
Can you feel the heat
Can you taste the fear
Do you know what I mean
How many times have you been alone
And how many times have you been together
Well I don't know I don't know
But I can tell you that they're both the same
A girl knows when she's got a man
Who's wrapped around her finger
Or just some boy whose circumstances
Will just have to do oh
And I've got nothing on my mind
Nothing to remember
Nothing to forget
And I've got nothing to regret
If I don't have any restrictions here are the uncensored lyrics of "Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You" by Glenn Medeiros:

If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever oh so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong

Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you if you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are

So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through but
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
I know you're lonely like everyone else
And you long for love that you can't get
And you desire that love to possess
But loneliness shadows you like an evil spell

I know you're scared like everyone else
And you keep your fears well-camouflaged
But behind that brilliant disguise
I can see the pain in your eyes

And I don't need no chains
I don't need no drugs or alcohol
Just a little bit of tenderness and love
To break the chains that hold you down

I know you're cheatin' like everyone else
And you think that love is a game that you can win
But honey love ain't no game
And you can't run away from the shame

So let's stop playin' this game
And take off those masks of shame
I wanna love and be loved in return
And I wanna see you without that brilliant disguise
Sure here are the lyrics to "Who Will You Run To" by Heart:

You're not sure what you want to do with your life
But you sure don't want me in it
Yeah you're sure the life you're living with me
Can't be right if you've got to hide it


Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who will you run to when I'm not around
Where will you go when the party's over
What will you do when your life gets colder

You're running scared from feelings that you don't understand
You're looking for somebody who can
Hold your hand
When it gets rough and it's dragging you down
Baby just remember I'm around


Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who will you run to when I'm not around
Where will you go when the party's over
What will you do when your life gets colder




Who will you run to
Oh who you gonna run to
Who will you run to
Yeah

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who will you run to when I'm not around
Where will you go when the party's over
What will you do when your life gets colder

Who will you run to when it all falls down
Who will you run to when I'm not around
Where will you go when the party's over 
What will you do when your life gets colder

Who will you run to
Oh who you gonna run to
Who will you run to 


If you disrespect anybody  
That you run in to  
How in the world do you think  
Anybody s'posed to respect you  
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man  
With the bible in his hand  
Just get out of the way  
And let the gentleman do his thing  
You're the kind of gentleman  
That wants everything their way  
Take the sheet off your face boy  
It's a brand new day  
Respect yourself  
Respect yourself  
If you don't respect yourself  
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot na na na na  
Respect yourself  
Respect yourself  
If you're walking 'round think'n  
That the world owes you something  
'Cause you're here  
You goin' out the world backwards  
Like you did when you first come here  
Keep talkin' 'bout the president  
Won't stop air pollution  
Put your hand over your mouth  
When you cough that'll help the solution  
Oh you cuss around women  
And you don't even know their names  
And you dumb enough to think  
That'll make you a big ol' man  
Respect yourself  
Respect yourself  
If you don't respect yourself  
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot na na na na  
Respect yourself  
Respect yourself  
Aretha come on now  
If you don't respect yourself  
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot na na na na  
Respect yourself  
Respect yourself  
Respect yourself  
Respect yourself

The battle is not to the strong alone it's the vigilant the faithful

You gotta keep on fighting until you hear the victory sound


Victory ooh victory

And every step you take just gets a little bit colder

You gotta keep on moving until you see the victory sign yea


Victory ooh victory
I've tasted it I've reached it

And never let them see you fall just keep standing tall
And believe believe in yourself
And nothing can hold you back nothing can stop you now


Victory ooh victory
I've tasted it I've reached it
Victory victory
I've won it I've overcome


Hey victory victory
I've won it I've overcome
Victory victory victory victory

Ballerina girl you are so lovely
With you standing there I'm so aware
Of how much I care for you
You are more than now you are for always
I can see in you my dreams come true
Don't you ever go away
You make me feel like there's nothing I can't do
And when I hold you tight
I feel alive thanks to you
Ballerina girl the joy you bring me
Every day and night holding you tight
How I've waited for your love
Sometimes I've wondered if you'd ever come my way
Now that I've found you
I don't ever want to lose you
Ballerina girl you are so lovely
How I love the way you move
Thanks for all the joy you bring me
Making love to you
Is like a dream come true yeah
Ballerina girl you are so lovely
Ballerina girl you are so lovely

Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics of "I've Been in Love Before" by Cutting Crew:


I've been in love before
I've been in love before
It's not that easy
Underneath the moonlit sky
Her serious nature
Sits high on her horse

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
With you

I’ve built a wall around me
I've kept you out
But now I feel like giving in
I've got a feeling
That's inside of me
It's deep enough to dream
But strong enough to win

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
With you
I've been in love before
I've been in love before
With you

Underneath this open sky
I'm gonna lie here
And watch the world go by

I've been in love before
I've been in love before
With you
I've been in love before
I've been in love before
With you

I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday
An' I've made up my mind I ain't wasting no more time


Here I go again here I go again
Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams


And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
But I've made up my mind I ain't wasting no more time


Here I go again here I go again
Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams


And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind I ain't wasting no more time


Here I go again here I go again
Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams


And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
And here I go again on my own
On my own
Once upon a time not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks union's been on strike
He's down on his luck it's tough so tough
Gina works the diner all day working for her man
She brings home her pay for love for love
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Whoa we're half way there
Whoa oh livin' on a prayer
Take my hand we'll make it I swear
Whoa oh livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night Tommy whispers baby it's okay
Someday
We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Whoa we're half way there
Whoa oh livin' on a prayer
Take my hand we'll make it I swear
Whoa oh livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer
We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
Whoa we're half way there
Whoa oh livin' on a prayer
Take my hand we'll make it I swear
Whoa oh livin' on a prayer
Whoa we're half way there
Whoa oh livin' on a prayer
Take my hand we'll make it I swear
Whoa oh
Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you

I can't live with or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied my body bruised
She's got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose

With or without you
With or without you

I can't live with or without you

With or without you
With or without you

I can't live with or without you

With or without you
With or without you

I can't live with or without you

With or without you
With or without you

I can't live with or without you
Children behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand
And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say
"I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound"
Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doin'
'Cause what would they say
If they ever knew
And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say
"I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound"
Tommy James & The Shondells cover
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
Looking for a little romance
Given half a chance

I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your head that catch your eyes I have been blind
The lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek
There's nobody here it's just you and me it's where I wanna be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright you were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled it took my breath away

I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love as I do tonight
The lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek
There's nobody here it's just you and me it's where I wanna be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

I never will forget the way you look tonight
The lady in red my lady in red
My lady in red my lady in red
I love you

Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again


Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living


Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on to each other
Ah yes we did it all
For love we fought
We were young and we were bold


Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living


Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you
We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is you never let it end


Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
No-no-notorious
No-no-notorious

I can't read about it
Burns the skin from your eyes
I'll do fine without it
Here's one you don't compromise
Lies come hard in disguise
They need to fight it out
Not wild about it
Lay your seedy judgments
Who says they're part of our lives


You own the money
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
Don't monkey with my business
You pay the prophets to justify your reasons
I heard your promise but I don't believe it
That's why I've done it again
No-no-notorious
Girls will keep the secrets uh
So long as boys make a noise
Fools run rings to break up
Something they'll never destroy
Grand Notorious slam bam
And who really gives a damn
For a flaky bandit
Don't ask me to bleed about it
I need this blood to survive



That's why I've done it again
No-no-notorious


Sometimes in our lives we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you don't let show

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me

Call me If you need a friend
Call me Call me uh-huh
Call me When you need a friend
Call me If you ever need a friend
Call me Call me
Call me Call me
Call me Call me
Call me Call me
Call me If you need a friend
Call me Call me
Call me When you need a friend
Call me If you ever need a friend
Call me Call me
Call me Call me
Call me Call me
Call me Call me
Call me When you need a friend
Call me If you ever need a friend
Call me Call me

Set me free why don't you babe
Get out my life why don't you babe
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a-comin' around
Playing with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a brand new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me hey

Set me free why don't you babe
Let me be why don't you babe
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
Now you don't really want me
You just keep me hangin' on

You say you've still got love to give
But I say you've had your chance
So take yourself a brand new start
And let somebody else be your man
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Set me free why don't you babe
Get out my life why don't you babe
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Ah you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
Hangin' on hangin' on hangin' on

Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally


Somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith


Kept my faith
When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting I knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free


I don't regret a single moment
No I don't looking back when I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh I just laugh


When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together
Through destiny's plan
I know this love we share was meant to be


I knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting for me
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Who's That Girl" by Madonna:


Who's that girl I'd like to know
What's her name I'd like to know
She's the one she's the queen
Of my dreams of my dreams


Who's that girl who's that girl
When you see her say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble in a word get closer to the fire
Run faster her laughter burns you up inside


You're a slave to her pain
Cutting veins gettin' off on her game
And there's no way to escape
You're in too deep can't you see


Who's that girl who's that girl
When you see her say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble in a word get closer to the fire
Run faster her laughter burns you up inside


Who's that girl who's that girl
Against the glass she's posed for me
I bet you're going to say you love me
But I'm already gone
You're already king of the hill
You're already big man on the scene
Why should you care if I'm gone


Who's that girl who's that girl
When you see her say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble in a word get closer to the fire
Run faster her laughter burns you up inside


Who's that girl who's that girl
Who's that girl who's that girl
Keep an eye on what you have
'Cause you have so much to lose
And you're running you're running
You're running away
Your will is strong and you're so afraid
Of what you need just like the sun
And you're burning you're burning
You're burning away
But no one can feel your temperature rise
So put your faith in a late night show
And don't let the believer know
No don't let the believer know
You're in too deep and you can't get out
You're getting deeper you can't get out
You want someone to take your hand
And you're playing you're playing
You're playing with fire
The words have power and the passion brings
But you're running you're running
You're running away
And all the while you linger here
Your temperature's getting higher dear
Your temperature's getting higher dear
You're in too deep and you can't get out
You're getting deeper you can't get out
And when you're high and you're feeling low
Take a tip from the late night show
The believer might say
Take it faster than light
And you'll be left alone
But take it slowly
And reap the reward
And all the while you linger here
Your temperature's getting higher dear
Your temperature's getting higher dear
You're in too deep and you can't get out
You're getting deeper you can't get out
You're in too deep and you can't get out
You're getting deeper you can't get out
Alright Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Let's Wait Awhile" by Janet Jackson:

There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow

Chorus
We shouldn't rush into anything
We shouldn't rush into love
We should take it slow

Verse 2
Though it's late and I'm feeling so 
lonely
And I know that you feel the same
But we need to be strong and 
take our time
To see if this is really real

Chorus
We shouldn't rush into anything
We shouldn't rush into love
We should take it slow

Bridge
Just think about it
Isn't this the way life's meant 
to be
Only time will tell us
But we should know this isn't 
an fantasy

Chorus
We shouldn't rush into anything
We shouldn't rush into love
We should take it slow

Outro
No no no
Let's wait awhile before it's too 
late
Let's wait awhile before we go 
too far
I didn't really know whether I 
should trust myself
I was afraid that I might 
rush foolishly
It's unbelievable how what once 
was just a fantasy
Now has become our reality
Everyday feels like Sunday
You make me feel like heaven
I never want to leave
You said that we should take it 
slowly
And now I know that you are 
the only one for me
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Hip to Be Square" by Huey Lewis and the News:

I used to be a renegade I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment and had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight and yes I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy but I don't even care

'Cause I can tell what's going on
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

I like my bands in business suits I watch them on TV
I'm working out most everyday and watching what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me but I don't even care
I know that it's crazy I know that it's nowhere

But there is no denying that
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

It's not too hard to figure out you see it everyday
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway it don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it an idea whose time has come

Don't tell me that I'm crazy don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

It's hip to be square
You come to me with your emotions  
You come to me with your troubles  
And you say to me: "Boy you're the kinda man who  
Likes to live in a bubble"  

Don't you know that a life's worth living  
Can't you see that yours is slipping away  
And we can talk all night but that ain't getting us nowhere  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me  

I tell you: life's too short to be wasted  
And time's too precious to be laid to waste  
So why why you waiting for someday  
To wake up and find your dreams have gone away  

Don't you know that a life's worth living  
Can't you see that yours is slipping away  
And we can talk all night but that ain't getting us nowhere  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me  

And we can talk all night but that ain't getting us nowhere  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me  

La da da da da da da da da  
La da da da da da da da  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me  

La da da da da da da da da  
La da da da da da da da  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me  

La da da da da da da da da  
La da da da da da da da  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me  

Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't free  
Don't mean nothing don't mean nothing  
Don't mean nothing if it ain't me
Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics of "Carrie" by Europe:

When lights go down I see no reason
For you to cry we've been through this before
In every time in every season
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie Carrie things they change my friend
Carrie Carrie maybe we'll meet again

I read your mind with no intentions
Of being unkind I wish I could explain
It all takes time a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime how come I feel no pain

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie Carrie things they change my friend
Carrie Carrie maybe we'll meet again

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie Carrie things they change my friend
Carrie Carrie maybe we'll meet again
Oh oh-oh

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie Carrie things they change my friend
Carrie Carrie maybe we'll meet again
Oh oh-oh

Carrie Carrie things they change my friend
Carrie Carrie maybe we'll meet again
Oh oh-oh
Verse 1:
There's a time and place for everything for everyone
We can push with all our might but nothin's gonna come
Oh no nothin's gonna change
And if I asked you not to try
Oh could you let it be

Verse 2:
I wanna hold you and say: We can't throw this away
A mess-ed up part a sudd-en start
Deny that if you want but don't disturb this groove

Verse 3:
The music sounds familiar I can hear it now
I intensified the picture but there's no way to know how
Oh no you can't hear it too
And if they ask you tell them no
We'll turn it up loud

Verse 4:
There's a time and place for everything for everyone
We can push with all our might but nothin's gonna come
Oh no nothin's gonna change
And if I asked you not to try
Oh could you let it be

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Come Go with Me" by Exposé:

Ooh baby
You're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind

I'll make you want me
More and more
And leave you wanting
What you're asking for

Chorus
Come come come
Come go with me
I love the way you move
Come come come
Come go with me
Whisper in my ear ooh baby
Come and take my hand

Surely Here it is:

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for

We're losing time in finding answers
And time is running out
I know we can make it
If we only try

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for

I'll be there if you should need me
You don't have to call
Just reach out and touch me
Close your eyes and I'll be there

When our hearts are filled with doubt
And we're a question of it all
Our love will conquer all

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for

Love is worth a little sacrifice
If we both give a little more
There's nothing we can't rise above

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for
It's all the same only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think
I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted wanted dead or alive
Wanted wanted dead or alive
Oh and I ride
I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I walk these streets a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted wanted dead or alive
I'm a cowboy I got the night on my side
I'm wanted wanted dead or alive
And I ride dead or alive
I still drive dead or alive
Dead or alive
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Let Me Be the One" by Exposé:

Verse 1:
I could never find another
Who compares to you
Could never find the words to say
How much I need you
You don't know how hard I've tried
To find a love that's new
There's no sense in searching anymore
Cause my heart still belongs to you

Chorus:
Let me be the one
To hold you tight
Let me be the one
To make all things right
Let me be the one
To say goodnight
Let me be the one

Verse 2:
I could search this whole world over
For someone like you
But nothing compares to the way
You make me feel inside
And it's hard to walk away
From love you just can't hide
There's no sense in living anymore
Cause without you I've got no life

Chorus:
Let me be the one
To hold you tight
Let me be the one
To make all things right
Let me be the one
To say goodnight
Let me be the one

Bridge:
I'll never give up trying
Cause my heart has no denying
I'll never find the love you've given me
Anywhere in this world

Outro:
Let me be the one
To hold you tight
Let me be the one
To make all things right
Let me be the one
To say goodnight
Let me be the one
Love can make you weep
Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
The taste of jealousy is like a lust for gold
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I've been feeling so much older
Frame me and hang me on the wall
I've seen you fall into the same trap
This thing is happening to us all yeah

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I thought I'd throw this chance away
But here I am asking you to stay
For a little while inside by arms
Oh be my baby

Oh oh oh oh oh
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Something so strong oh oh oh oh oh
Something so strong oh oh oh oh oh
Something so strong oh oh oh oh oh
Something so strong oh oh oh oh oh
I can only provide the uncensored lyrics of "Just to See Her" by Smokey Robinson as they were originally written and recorded Any additional commentary censorship or information is not included in the lyrics:

"Just to see her
Just to see her
It's been a long time
Been a long time
But when I do
But when I do
I know that I'll
Know that I'll
That I'll want her love to be mine

I've been away from her for two long years
And I never expect to cry no more
Lord I forgot all about these tears
Ever since she walked out that door

Just to see her
Just to see her

I'd give anything anything
Just to see her
Anything anything
Just to see her
Anything anything
Just to see her

I've seen many other girls since then
But it's only her that I've been missin'
Lord I hope she feels the same way too
Whenever our eyes meet I'm wishin'

Just to see her
Just to see her

I want her back in my arms again
Right by my side
Oh oh oh just to see her
Oh oh oh oh oh just to see her
Oh oh oh oh oh just to see her
Oh oh oh oh just to see her

Just to see her
Just to see her
Just to see her
Just to see her"

Note: The parentheses indicate repeats in the lyrics

I'm not the kind of man who makes the same mistakes again
I'm not the kind of man who makes the same mistakes again
And again or twice ah ah
But you you tempt me with your charms
And I'll be wrapped around your finger in your arms


I'm doin' it all for my baby
I'm a roller in a rockin' rollin' crazy
I'm doin' it all for my baby
Take a taxi take a train take a car


I'll be there no matter how far
'Cause I love my baby
I love my baby
I'm doing it all for my baby


I'm doin' it all for my baby
I'm a roller in a rockin' rollin' crazy
I'm doin' it all for my baby
Take a red hot powder and a Prickly Heat
A Manta Ray tatoo that's hard to beat
We're doin' it all doin' it all for my baby


I know that your mama she don't approve of me
'Cause I plays in a rock and roll band
And I might stay out all night if I can


I'm doin' it all for my baby
I'm a roller in a rockin' rollin' crazy
I'm doin' it all for my baby


Do it up Do it all for my baby
Do it up Do it all for my baby
Do it up Do it all for my baby
Do it up Do it all for my baby
Ooh ooh
In a lifetime
Made of memories
I believe
In destiny
Every moment returns again in time
When I've got the future on my mind
Know that you'll be the only one

Meet me halfway across the sky
Out where the world belongs to only you and I
Meet me halfway across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life

In a lifetime there is only love
Reaching for the lonely one
We are stronger when we are given love
When we put emotions on the line
Know that we are the timeless ones

Meet me halfway across the sky
Out where the world belongs to only you and I
Meet me halfway across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life

Ooh ooh

Meet me halfway across the sky
Out where the world belongs to only you and I
Meet me halfway across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Sure thing Here are the uncensored lyrics for "You Gotta Fight for Your Right To Party" by the Beastie Boys:



You wake up late for school man you don't want to go
You ask your mom "Please" but she still says "No"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

You gotta fight for your right to party
Your pop caught you smoking and he said "No way"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag Busted

You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair

It is -- it's more than love
Love the way you move
And the way you tease me

The way you touch me
And the way you kiss
No it's not enough
To say I love you

But sometimes words are not enough
Don't you wanna know how much I love you
Don't you wanna know how much I care
Oh I wanna shake you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna spin you around

Well well
And if you're the kind of girl who likes
To settle down

Love so strong

Re-arranging
Stories to be told
And plain to see the facts are changing
No meaning left to hold

Chorus
Don't you want me to come alive
And everybody to be high
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight

Everybody turns to stone
When they're alone
Lonely lose themselves
In oceans of solitude

All we need is someone to have fun with
We're on the run boy we need have some fun tonight

Chorus
This ain't party this ain't no disco
This ain't fooling around
No time for dancing or lovey dovey
I ain't got time for that now

Chorus
If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
Close my close my close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day to believe in you
Tell me tell me tell me lies

Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies tell me tell me lies
Oh no no you can't disguise
You can't disguise no you can't disguise
Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies

Rules and regulations
Gotta get away from the political scene

I said I'm Casanova
And I'm your man

You're moving like you want someone
But I can't let myself be played
I got to be your number one

Verse 1:
There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

Chorus:
I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex

Verse 2:
I want you
You know I want you
I want you to want me too
I want you to stay
And never go away
It's all I can take
This is no ordinary love
We're not in ordinary world
Can you hear me
Do you care
Do you want to
Ooh

Chorus:
I want your sex

Bridge:
Saxophone solo

Chorus:
I want your sex

Verse 3:
It's natural
It's chemical let's do it
It's logical let's go
Habitual can we do it
Physical I need
It's everything I hoped for
Everything I need
Let's just enjoy
The secret knowledge of the animal instinct

Chorus:
I want your sex

Outro:
Sex sex
I want your sex
Sex sex sex

I've got the moves baby you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion


Cause you're so fine and you're mine
And you make me want to shout "hey yeah"
You're so fine and you're mine
And you make me want to scream


You're looking so hot baby you got me foaming
Like a dog on a heatwave I'm sweating and I'm stoning
I got the eyes baby you got the potion
Slap me 'round the face and I'm in love with your motion


Cause you're so fine and you're mine
And you make me want to shout "hey yeah"
You're so fine and you're mine
And you make me wanna scream


Got me burning up with your bad persuasion
You've got me psycing up on your stimulation
You've got me burning up with your bad persuasion
I'm wide awake and I'm in need of some ventilation


Cause you're so fine and you're mine
And you make me want to shout "hey yeah"
You're so fine and you're mine
And you make me wanna scream


You've got the moves baby you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
You've got the moves baby you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
Morning morning just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes I see a memory
I never realized how happy you made me oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my mind and nothing is rhyming oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
But I send you away oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream I face the morning
Crying on a breeze the pain is calling oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today oh Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away oh Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you oh Mandy
You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away oh Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you
Verse 1:
I'm caught up in your mystery
I'm chasing down the history
That you made between the sheets
And I know that I should let it go
But every time I think that I erode
Your memory shows up with a rose
And I realize it's no use
Saying goodbye to you

Chorus:
So I cross my broken heart
And I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you
After all is said and done
And I know the price is high
But I am willing to pay
To cross my broken heart today

Verse 2:
I'm living in the danger zone
I'm dancing with the setting sun
And when you touch me it's like gold
But I know that I should walk away
Cause nothing ever good can stay
But my heart's gone too far to let you go
And I realize it's no use
Saying goodbye to you

Chorus

Bridge:
I swore never to do this again
I promised myself I'd never give in
But your love is a powerful force
It's driving me it's driving me
It's driving me back to your door

Chorus
Verse 1:
Every time I'm telling secrets
I remember how it used to be
And I realize how much I miss you
And I realize how it feels to be free

Pre-Chorus:
Now I see I'm up to no good no no good
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good felt good baby
No I can't remember when

Chorus:
Only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

Verse 2:
Couldn't see how much I missed you now I do
Couldn't see how much it meant
Now I see my world come tumbling down tumbling down
And I'm feeling all alone

Pre-Chorus:
Now I see I'm up to no good no no good
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good felt good baby
No I can't remember when

Chorus:
Only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

Bridge:
Only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

Outro:
Only in my dreams
Only in my dreams
What did you think I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me with tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me that you have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

What did you think I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge that you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you or raise my hands to you
Oh come on you know me too well
How could I hurt you when darling I love you
And you know I'll never hurt you

What do you think I will give at this moment
If you're not in my life I will give up this fight
If you love somebody else if you're trying to break free
Just remember darling you belong to me

Oh I love you baby won't you come back to me
Verse 1:
I remember when you filled my heart with joy
Was I blind to the truth just there to fill the space
'Cause now you have no interest in any conversation
'Cept' spreading rumors and lies all over the place

Chorus:
So now I see that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along
And I was just another game
When you knew all along how to play

Verse 2:
Should've known it when you took my friend out for a date
I trusted you not to hurt me
Now I'm kicking myself for making that mistake oh yeah
And I can't believe that I stayed 'til this far
You want to start over but I'm afraid
'Cause the love that we had is now lost in your game

Chorus:
So now I see that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along
And I was just another game
When you knew all along how to play

Bridge:
I never should've let you in
A damn shame forgot my name oh
Love should never hurt in vain

Chorus:
So now I see that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along
And I was just another game
When you knew all along how to play

Outro:
Oh oh I played your game your game
Why'd you have to lie
I played your game
You've got me in chains chains chains
I'd be happy to provide you the lyrics to "Keep Your Hands to Yourself" by Georgia Satellites:

I got a little change in my pocket going jing-a-ling-a-ling
Want to call you on the telephone baby give you a ring
But each time we talk I get the same old thing
Always no huggin' no kissin' until I get a wedding ring

My honey my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said "Don't hand me no lines
And keep your hands to yourself"

Cruel baby baby baby
Why you want to treat me this way
You know I'm still your lover boy
I still feel the same way

That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said no huggin' no kissin' until I get a wedding vow

My honey my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said "Don't hand me no lines
And keep your hands to yourself"

See I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talkin' true love started talkin' about sin
 
I said "Honey I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
She said "No huggin' no kissin' until you make me your wife"

My honey my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said "Don't hand me no lines
And keep your hands to yourself"
