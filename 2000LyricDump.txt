Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whispering in the words to melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu√±equita my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove yeah

And if you said "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth yeah
Gimme your heart make it real
Or else forget about it

But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And if you said "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth yeah
Gimme your heart make it real
Or else forget about it

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth yeah
Gimme your heart make it real
Or else forget about it

Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Give me your heart make it real
Let's forget about it
Alright here are the uncensored lyrics of "Maria Maria" by Santana featuring The Product G&B:


Ladies and gents
Turn up this sound system
To the sound of Carlos Santana
And the GMB's
Ghetto Blues from the Refugee Gang


Oh Maria Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh Maria Maria
She fell in love in East LA
To the sounds of the guitar yeah yeah
Played by Carlos Santana


Stop the looting stop the shooting
Pickpocketing on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Somebody just said "See you later"


Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola
Mama chola mama chola


Oh Maria Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh Maria Maria
She fell in love in East LA
To the sounds of the guitar yeah yeah
Played by Carlos Santana


Stop the looting stop the shooting
Pickpocketing on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Somebody just said "See you later"


Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola
Mama chola mama chola


I said a la favella los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Ni gota de esperanza
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping of days of paradise
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola


Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola
Mama chola mama chola

Everything you like

I just wanna love you baby
I just wanna please you baby
I just wanna be there for you baby
All the time oh baby
Somewhere there's speaking it's already coming in  
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind  
You never could get it unless you were fed it  
Now you're here and you don't know why  
But under skinned knees and the skid marks  
Past the places where you used to learn  
You howl and listen listen and wait for  
the Echoes of angels who won't return  
He's everything you want He's everything you need  
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be  
He says all the right things at exactly the right time  
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why   
You're waiting for someone to put you together  
You're waiting for someone to push you away  
There's always another wound to discover  
There's always something more you wish he'd say  
He's everything you want he's everything you need  
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be  
He says all the right things at exactly the right time  
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why  
But you'll just sit tight  
And watch it unwind  
It's only what you're asking for  
And you'll be just fine  
With all of your time  
Its only what you're losing  
Gaining what you've already had  
Its only what you're given  
Its only what you deserve  
Its only what you're asking for  
And you'll be just fine  
With all of your time  
Its only what you're waiting for  
And you'll be just fine  
But while the night is young  
Oh so young  
You might still want me  
You might still want me  
You might still want me  
To come take you home  
But I will stand by   
The things that I have done  
You know I am not wrong  
And you're not right  
But he's a simple man  
So watchian with your eyes  
All his answers are  
Sayings that he's heard  
He's a clean-cut kid  
And he knows who he is  
But after everything he's done  
He wonders  
He's everything you want he's everything you need  
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be  
He says all the right things at exactly the right time  
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why  
He's everything you want he's everything you want  
He's everything you need he's everything you need  
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be  
He says all the right things at exactly the right time  
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why
Verse 1:
Any other day I would call
You would say "Baby how's your day"
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is "Uh huh" "Yeah okay"

Verse 2:
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady
If you took it there first of all let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
Supportin' us for years boy you betta' come correct

Chorus:
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you say "Baby I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game say my name say my name
You actin' kinda shady ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change Say my name say my name

Verse 3:
If no one is around you say "Baby I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game say my name say my name
You actin' kinda shady ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

Chorus:
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you say "Baby I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game say my name say my name
You actin' kinda shady ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change Say my name say my name

Bridge:
Any other day I would call you would say "Baby how's your day"
But today ain't the same every other word is "Uh huh" "Yeah okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady
Subscribe to the channel tell me what you think of my delivery

Chorus:
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you say "Baby I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game say my name say my name
You actin' kinda shady ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change Say my name say my name

Outro:
Say my name say my name
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name say my name
Why the sudden change
Verse 1:
Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I've found my best friend

Chorus:
I knew it from the moment
When we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

Verse 2:
Maybe it's the mountains
Maybe it's the city lights
Or the way you move
I want to hold you through the night
I gotta say it
You're giving me a feeling that I'm so used to denying

Chorus:
I knew it from the moment
When we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

Bridge:
I see your face I breathe you in I'm standing here beside you
I want so much to say the words
But I don't want to scare you

Chorus:
I knew it from the moment
When we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong

Outro:
I guess it's just the way that love can change your life so easily
Is it the way that you make me feel
I gotta say that I believe it I believe it
If you're not the first one to the line  
are you just less important  
And if you're not how can you be sure  
that you've done nothing wrong  
We're just pushing along  
Selling our own ideals proclaiming so proudly  

We're top of the world  
Top of the world Ma  
we're top of the world  
All sitting here wishing the world would end  
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I  

You're just a little bit shy  
A bit too fat a bit too thin  
You're just a little bit short  
You're just not enough like him  

But you are  
But you are  

We're just pushing along  
Selling our own ideals proclaiming so proudly  

We're top of the world  
Top of the world Ma  
we're top of the world  
All sitting here wishing the world would end  
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I  

When I'm too old to dream  
I'll have you to remember  
And when I find myself in lonely places  
I'll have you to remember  

You're just a little deranged  
You're a little bit strange  
You're a little bit lost inside  
But you are  

We're top of the world  
Top of the world Ma  
we're top of the world  
All sitting here wishing the world would end  
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I  

Are you happy  
Are you satisfied  
How long can you stand the heat  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
Repeating to the sound of the beat  

We're top of the world  
Top of the world Ma  
we're top of the world  
All sitting here wishing the world would end  
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I  

Are you dreaming  
Are you dying  
How long can you do it again  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
Repeating to the sound of the beat  

Are you hardened  
Can you face it  
Can you muster up the same old fight  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip  
To the sound of the beat  

We're top of the world  
Top of the world Ma  
we're top of the world  
All sitting here wishing the world would end  
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I  

We're top of the world  
Top of the world Ma  
we're top of the world  
All sitting here wishing the world would end  
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I  

We're top of the world  
Top of the world Ma  
we're top of the world  
All sitting here wishing the world would end  
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I  

We're top of the world  
And I'm in love with the girl  
In the song that she's singing  
About a lonely guy that came in from the cold  

Top of the world Ma I'm on  
Top of the world Ma I'm on  
Yea we're top of the world Ma I'm on  
Top of the world Ma I'm on  
Top of the world Ma I'm on  
Yea we're top of the world Ma I'm on  
Top of the world Ma I'm on  
We're top of the world
Darkchild yeah
Listen girl
Who do you think I am
Don't you know that he was my man
But I chose to let him go
So why do you actin' like I still care about him
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said "I didn't want it to work"
Don't you forget I had him first

What you thinkin'
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

How could you be so naive
To think he would leave me to love thee
But I knew you'd want what I had
Got me feelin' kinda sad
I was the one who said "I love you" first
It was about eight years ago
Don't act like you didn't know no no

What you thinkin'
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

You can't seem to see
That he was sad inside
Oh when he told me goodbye
You said you loved me
Oh what a lie
'cause you betrayed me
And you said you'd never hurt me
Don't you know I won't be your fool anymore

What you thinkin'
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop fucking with me
Make me wanna scream
When dreaming I'm guided through another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there let's make our escape
Come on let's go there let's ask can we stay
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate those nights and those dreams
But my friend I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams alike
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate
So let's go there let's make our escape
Come on let's go there let's ask can we stay
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets
So let's go there let's go there
Come on let's go there let's ask can we stay
Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets
What would you do to get to me
What would you say to have your way
Would you give up or try again
If I hesitate to let you in

Now would you be yourself or play your role
Tell all the boys or keep it low
If I say no would you turn away
Or play me off or would you stay

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again try again

I'm into you you into me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not 'til I see what this could be
Be eternity or just a week

You know our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now why would you wanna change oh boy
You tried everything in the book
Now you're back trying to cook

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again try again


You're dusting right off and try again
 I'll get back on
 I'll get back on and try again
 You don't succeed
You can get dusted off and try again
 You don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again

If you wanna try again try again
If you wanna try again try again
If you wanna try again try again
If you wanna try again try again try again
If you wanna try again try again
If you wanna try again try again
If you wanna try again try again
If you wanna try again try again try again

If at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again
If at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
You can dust it off and try again try again
Dust yourself off and try again try again

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head if not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

I'm taking one last look at you before I say goodbye
So there's no need to argue no need to reply
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

Yeah yeah yeah

Oops couldn't miss the way you flirted with me
Crossing legs and rubbing thighs and running fingers through your hair
Said you want to give me that pretty kitty
Sitting there sipping on your glass and staring at me
Said you want to hit the club and move your body
I'm thinking that must be Jin Ginuwine
Looked at my Cartier said it's kind of nice
I said "Thanks the little one kind of blings huh"

Don't matter don't matter doesn't really matter
Don't matter don't matter doesn't really matter
Don't matter don't matter doesn't really matter
Don't matter don't matter doesn't really matter

You said your name is this then you handed me your digits
Said you got a man but you're out tonight
I smiled and then you kicked some more flirts
Said you got a man but you're out tonight
Then I said "If you got a man why you chilling with me"
She said "Well he's at home sleeping and he has been for a week"
Oops I might have spilled the glass don't want to ask way you move it fast
Can't help but to take a glance see if the ass matching with them pants
Oh no diggity about to bag it up and ask her who the man that's getting lucky
After the club: hotels lobbies reminiscent of Lost in Translation
Deeper than the new translation

Don't matter don't matter doesn't really matter
Don't matter don't matter doesn't really matter
Don't matter don't matter doesn't really matter
Don't matter don't matter doesn't really matter

Doesn't really matter to me

You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just in the nick of time
One you're like a dream come true
Two just wanna be with you
Three girl it's plain to see that you're the only one for me

Verse 1:
Bright lights fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Chorus:
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Verse 2:
Listen your perfume your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year winter summer spring and fall
But being without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Chorus:
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Bridge:
Your love is incomplete
Your love is incomplete
Your love is incomplete
Your love is incomplete

Chorus:
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Outro:
Without you girl oh
Without you girl my life is incomplete
Games changes and fears
When will they go from here
When will they stop
I believe that fate has brought us here
And we should be together babe
But we're not
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
I'll keep my cool but I'm fiendin'
I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem all right and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front just a front
Hey I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool but I'm fiendin'
I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Here is my confession
May I be your possession
Boy I need your touch
Your love kisses and such
With all my might I try
But this I can't deny
Denied
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool but I'm fiendin'
I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
See I'm lovesick I pray to be granted
Purpose function or maybe a replacement
But just my luck I act like a grown-up
And bide my time like it's almost showtime
And take a sip of that divine
I shake and bake it every time
I reach you by phone or by text or by email
I love that smell ya know that new email smell
I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

It's gonna be me
Ooh yeah
You might've been hurt babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man no cry
Maybe that's why


Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me


You've got no choice babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just too blind babe
But I'll be there for you yeah
When you're realizing
That forever was the price was the price
Ooh you know how I feel

Bridge:
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the 'I love you's'
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us

They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right

Baby they don't know about

Chorus:
When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is

Outro:
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
And that's the way it is
Show me the meaning of being lonely is this the feeling I need to walk with  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart  
  
Life goes on as it never ends  
Eyes of stone observe the trends  
They never say forever gaze if only  
Guilty roads to an endless love  
There's no control are you with me now  
Your every wish will be done  
  
They tell me  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart  
  
There's nowhere to run I have no place to go  
Surrender my heart body and soul  
How can it be you're asking me to feel the things you never show  
You are missing in my heart  
  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart

You always make me smile
When I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe
I'ts totally bonafide mmm
It's not the way you walk
And it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got
That keeps me satisfied

Your love it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of

Oh oh yeah

Mmm oh uh-huh
There ain't no need for us
To rush this through
Don't think about it don't think about it
Let's take a ride and spend
a little time little time
Now that we're together
Gonna treat you right
Gonna make you feel
Like you're mine
You're the one for me
And I'm the one for you

Your love it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of

Oh oh yeah

Mmm oh uh-huh

Your love it feels so

Your love it feels so good
Well I just heard the news today
It seems my life is gonna change
I close my eyes and begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe we've created life

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything

With arms wide open
If I had just one wish
Only one demand
I hope he's not like me
I hope he understands
That he can take this life
And hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world
With arms wide open

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

And it goes on and on
When I'm lost in the rain \
In your eyes I know I'll find the light \
To light my way \
When I'm scared losing ground \
When my world is going crazy \
You can turn it all around \
And when I'm down you're there \
Pushing me to the top \
You're always there giving me all you've got 

For a shield from the storm \
For a friend for a love \
To keep me safe and warm \
I turn to you \
For the strength to be strong \
For the will to carry on \
For everything you do \
For everything that's true \
I turn to you 

When I lose the will to win \
I just reach for you \
And I can reach my worlds again \
I can do anything \
'Cause your love is so amazing \
'Cause your love inspires me 

And when I need a friend \
You're always on my side \
Giving me faith taking me through the night 

For a shield from the storm \
For a friend for a love \
To keep me safe and warm \
I turn to you \
For the strength to be strong \
For the will to carry on \
For everything you do \
For everything that's true \
I turn to you 

For the arms to be my shelter \
Through all the rain \
For truth that will never change \
For someone to lean on \
For a heart I can rely on \
Through anything any time \
For this I turn to you 

For the shield from the storm \
For a friend for a love \
To keep me safe and warm \
I turn to you \
For the strength to be strong \
For the will to carry on \
For everything you do \
For everything that's true \
For everything you do \
For everything that's true \
I turn to you
Verse 1:
Sometimes darkness 
seems to be too well 
I like to keep it 
as a way to keep myself 
to be sure 
to keep my own in check 
Cause in a room behind 
a door is a prize I won't forget

Chorus:
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 

Verse 2:
Don't you know 
that we're just a stupid 
Love is like a little glass heart 
we try to shape 
in our own image 
Our favours set us apart 
I'm never gonna let you go 
I'm never gonna let you go 
I'm never gonna let you go 
I'm never gonna let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
Never gonna let you go 

Verse 3:
I like to keep it 
as a way to show myself 
How strong I am 
and I'm sure 
that I don't need anybody else 
Cause in a room behind 
a door is a prize I won't forget 

Chorus:
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 

Bridge:
Only know what I know 
only seen what I've seen 
I'll tell you what I want 
I want to be your friend 
I want to superman 
Fly around the planet 
Until you understand 
I'm never gonna let you go 
I'm never gonna let you go 
I'm never gonna let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
Never gonna let you go 
Never gonna let you go 

Chorus:
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 

Outro:
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go
I'll do my best to provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Thank God I Found You" by Mariah Carey featuring Joe and 98 Degrees without any labels additional commentary censorship or information:


Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you


I never knew love like this before
Now I'm alone nevermore
Since you came into my life
Nothin's been the same
Prayer's answered and I'm complete
I'll never worry you're so sweet
Nothin's ever felt so right
As it does with you tonight

Sometimes it's hard to believe
When you come
And rescue me
I'm so glad I'll be
Reminded how real love can be

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you


Oh yeah yeah
Sometimes I can't see
What you see in me
Baby Especially the good in me
I always felt like something's missing
Then you came and made me better
Everyday I'm lovin' you
And pray that
God above me
Feels the same my love

All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you do love me too
I'd die in your arms if you knew what I've been through
Thank God I found you I'm thanking you
Been hurtin' for so long Been hurtin' for so long
God bless you

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you


I'll never forget I'll never forget
How I felt when we first met When we first met
You took a heart that was broken
Made me feel like I'm in heaven Heaven
You gave me a reason You gave me a reason
To love again To love
And though I travelled far Though I travelled
I always knew where you are I always knew where you are
I finally found my way
To you from the heart


And there'll be no more crying
And no more pain
Baby we're together we're together
Thanks to your love no more cryin'
And nothin's gonna tear us apart
Together we're together

Thank God I found you Whoo
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight

My whole life

I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful
'Cause baby I'm so thankful
I found you So thankful I found you
Thank God I found you
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you Lost without you
My every wish and every dream

'Cause baby I'm so thankful

I hope that helps
If I told you what I'm feeling
Would you believe me
Or would you walk away
Is that what you want Oh
Hold me close baby
Don't ever let me go
Oh no no no no

I said hold me close baby
Don't ever let me go

Oh no no no no
Don't let go of me
Oh no no no no

I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ooh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance with me yeah
Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance with me

With somebody who loves me

Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star that somewhere you are
Thinking of me too

'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming about you and me

Wanna dance with somebody
Wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance with me yeah
Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance with me

With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Soon or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance with me yeah
Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance with me

With somebody who loves me

With somebody who somebody who loves me
With somebody who somebody who loves me
With somebody who somebody who loves me
Verse 1:
You're in a bad way but I don't want to go
Making sure that I can take the blow
We have a bond a relation trip
That brings a tear such a long trip

Chorus:
Then the morning comes it'll be okay
Find another ride make another day
This morning comes it'll be alright
When will you wake up and see the light

Verse 2:
Over the night skies another one flown by
Wishful thinking before a lie
We're joined to the wrist with a promissory note
It drives me crazy but nobody knows

Chorus:
Then the morning comes it'll be okay
Find another ride make another day
This morning comes it'll be alright
When will you wake up and see the light

Bridge:
It's hard to believe your own cover story
Your feet are so big yet you're so small
Actually believe you can walk on the water
The clock is ticking and you'll lose it all

Chorus:
Then the morning comes it'll be okay
Find another ride make another day
This morning comes it'll be alright
When will you wake up and see the light

Outro:
Morning comes it'll be okay
This morning comes it'll be alright
Morning comes it'll be okay
This morning comes it'll be alright
Verse 1:
Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees

Blue his house with a blue little window
And a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him and himself
And everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen to

Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

I dream of rain  
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain  
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

  
I dream of fire  
Those dreams that tie two hearts that will never die  
And near the flames  
The shadows play in the shape of the man's desire

  
This desert rose  
Whose shadow bears the secret promise  
This desert flower  
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

  
And as the night falls  
And I'm waiting for youuuuuu  
Voiceless as the mothaaefaaac  
Silent as the sun we bathe in your kaaaryaaayeeeyaaaaaaasa  

  
I dream of rain  
I lift my gaze to empty skies above  
I close my eyes  
The rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of love  

  
I dream of rain  
I dream of gardens in the desert sand  
I wake in pain  
I dream of love as time runs through my hand  

  
Sweet desert rose  
Whose shadow bears the secret promise  
This desert flower  
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of love  

  
Oh ya he yeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ah ya ya ye yieeee  
Ne ne na na heyana neyana  
Ne ne na na mah heyana heyana  

  
Sweet desert rose  
Whose shadow bears the secret promise  
This desert flower  
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this  

  
Sweet desert rose  
This memory of Eden haunts us all  
This desert flower  
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of the fall  

  
I dream of rain  
I dream of gardens in the desert sand  
I wake in pain  
I dream of love as time runs through my hand  

  
Ne ne na na heyana neyana

May I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced throwin' her over furniture Ah
It's the return of the "Ah wait no way you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did did he"
And Dr Dre said nothing you idiots
Dr Dre's dead he's locked in my basement Ha-ha
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who "Yeah but he's so cute though"


Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they
We ain't nothin' but mammals‚Äîwell some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes 


Some girls like to keep their physique real private  
Some girls sweat when they feel it right that‚Äôs alright  
But every girl in the world tonight all eyes on me and Alaska dancing tonight

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Wonderful" by Everclear:

Da da da da da da da da da da da 
Da da da da da da da da da da da 
Da da da da da da da da da da da 
Da da da da da da da da da da da  

I close my eyes when I get too sad  
I think thoughts that I know are bad  
Close my eyes and I count to ten  
Hope it's over when I open them  

I want the things that I had before  
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door  
I wish I could count to ten  
Make everything be wonderful again  

Hope my mom and I hope my dad  
Will figure out why they get so mad  
Hear them scream I hear them fight  
Say bad words that make me wanna cry  

Close my eyes when I go to bed  
And I dream of angels who make me smile  
I feel better when I hear them say  
Everything will be wonderful someday  

Promises mean everything when you're little  
And the world's so big  
I just don't understand how  
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes  

Tell me everything is wonderful now  
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now  

I go to school and I run and play  
I tell the kids that it's all okay  
I laugh aloud so my friends won't know  
When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home  

Go to my room and I close my eyes  
And I make believe that I have a new life  
I don't believe you when you say  
Everything will be wonderful someday  

Promises mean everything when you're little  
And the world is so big  
I just don't understand how  
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes  

Tell me everything is wonderful now  
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now  

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now  

I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now  

I don't wanna hear you say  
That I will understand someday  
No no no no  
I don't wanna hear you say  

You both have grown in a different direction  
You both have grown apart  
And I don't know what to say  
You both have your own separate stories  

And I'm just the chapter in your book  
But I still believe  
Everything  
Everything will be wonderful someday  

Promises mean everything when you're little  
And the world is so big  
I just don't understand how  
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes  

Tell me everything is wonderful now  
Please don't tell me everything  
Everything is wonderful now  
I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now  

I don't wanna hear you say  
That I will understand someday  

I don't wanna hear you say  
You both have grown in a different direction  
You both have grown apart  
And I don't know what to say  
You've both got your own separate stories  

And I'm just one chapter in your book  
But I still believe  
Everything will be wonderful someday

I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby baby

OopsI did it again
I played with your heart got lost in the game
Oh baby baby
OopsYou think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Baby oh

OopsI did it again
I played with your heart got lost in the game
Oh baby baby

OopsI did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game oh baby
OopsYou think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You set my soul at ease
Chased darkness out of view
Left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too
I know you do


I've got so much more to give
This can't die I yearn to live
Pour yourself all over me
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees


I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you
10000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do
Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew
I'm gonna love you forever


My mind fails to understand
What my heart tells me to do
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you
And that would do


I've always been taught to win
And I never thought I'd fall
Be at the mercy of a man
I've never been
Now I only want to be right where you are


I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you
10000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do
Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew
I'm gonna love you forever


In my life I've learned that heaven never waits no
Lets take this now before it's gone like yesterday
Cause when I'm with you there's nowhere else
That I would ever wanna be no
I'm breathless by your side


I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you
10000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do
Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew
I'm gonna love you forever

Una noche a night oh baby wanna give it to you
Una noche a night oh baby gonna make it come true
Well you got your chocolate

How long how long will I slide 
Separate my side I don't 
I don't believe it's bad 
Slit my throat 
It's all I ever 
 
I heard your voice through a photograph 
I thought it up and brought up the past 
Once you know you can never go back 
I've got to take it on the otherside 
Century that I'd love to hear 
We're making it up each day of the year 
Chorus 
You fall in love with another drag 
Your head in the clouds and you're gone and you're mine gone and you're mine  
It's not that I'd beneath the veil 
It's not that you make me hail 
It's not like you to say sorry 
I was waiting on a different story 
This time I'm mistaken 
For handing you a heart worth breakin' 
And I've been wrong I've been down 
Been to the bottom of every bottle 
These five words in my head 
Scream "Are we having fun yet" 
Chorus 
I'll take you on a roller 
Coaster ride 
I'll make you suicide 
I'll make you out live 
 
I don't ever want to feel 
Like I did that day 
Take me to the otherside 
Take me to the otherside 
Take me to the otherside
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Purest of Pain A Puro Dolor" by Son by Four:

Yo no s√© qu√© hacer
No s√© qu√© decir
No s√© ni siquiera
En qu√© momento te perd√≠
Si yo te diera mi vida
Por un segundo m√°s de amor
Har√≠a realidad
El sue√±o que jam√°s so√±√≥‚Ä¶
Una vez m√°s‚Ä¶
Ven devu√©lveme al amor
Que se fue llev√°ndose
Mi coraz√≥n
D√©jame volver a empezar
Ven a mi soledad
Quiero llenarte todo
De amor puro amor
I know you're gone
And chances are
They'll never bring you back
But there's a heart that cries inside me
And it's sad and it's dying for love
And I'm the only one left in this world
Who can make it all better again
So come back to me
Baby please 'cause we belong together
Come and ease the pain
That's hurting deep inside of me
And I'll be the purest of pain
Until you return to me
Until you return to me
Ven devu√©lveme al amor
Que se fue llev√°ndose
Mi coraz√≥n
D√©jame volver a empezar
Ven a mi soledad
Quiero llenarte todo
De amor puro amor
Verse 1:
It's crazy I'm 25 and I'm single

Something to the table I'm unstable
Got a PhD in 'I don't need you'

Worth waitin' for even if it takes forever

And I'm fillin' up inside 'cause I know I'm

Yeah yeah


I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
There's one thing that I know
I'll take her back if she wants to come
'Cause I don't want to see nobody else with her


I love her so much I can't let go
If I could just make her understand
I tried everything that a man can try
I'm telling you I don't wanna say goodbye


I wish I could turn back the hands of time
And start over again with you
I wish we could be lovers and friends
And start over again
I know that I'm not perfect
But I'm willing to try
To make everything right

If I could just make her understand
I tried everything that a man can try
I'm telling you I don't wanna say goodbye


I don't wanna lose her love
And I don't wanna lose my mind
But I can't help but think
That she's with somebody else tonight

Travelling to club sipping bub'
Badu on my CD player
I'm old school like Daddy Kane per say
I'm cussing claiming
But it's hard to get through the 6 in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon so what's up

To do what to be pressed against some so what's up
Girl you know what's up
And you know I know what's up now
Baby you know what's up
And you know I know what's up now

Ooh say what say what say what

Sipping Hennessy
Sitting low in my Lex
Playing this CD
All I'm trying to do is get my freak on what's up
We got an hour I'll be gone what's up
You say you'd just got off work what's up

I've been sittin' here
Tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself
I need to rewind myself
Lookin' for the payback
Listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one
Yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son
And it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills
It's helps to ease the pain
I made a couple of dollar bills
But still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name
They say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me
It's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay
To be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands
Still I can't find love
And when your walls come tumbling down
I will always be around yeah
As iteoh oh oh
And when your walls come tumbling down
I will always be around
People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit that I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I forgot all the things I miss
Oh somehow I know there's more to life than this
I said it too many times
And I still stand firm
You get what you put in
And people get what they deserve
Still I ain't seen mine
No I ain't seen mine
I've been givin' just ain't been gettin'
I've been walkin' that there line
So I think I'll keep on walkin'
With my head held high
I'll keep movin' on and only God knows why
Only God only God
Only God knows why
Only God knows why why why only God knows why
She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always messy
Lauderdale 'cross her chest
She reads books out loud just to feel like she's alive

Her father didn't like me
But come to think of it neither did she
He said that I was worthless
And she wished that she were worthless too

But I'll make her feel pretty again
And hold her tight
I'll make her feel like she's the only one
And everything's all right

I'll take her anywhere
I'll take her anywhere as long as she's with me
And if it gets too late
I'll make her a bed and lay her down beside me

Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen

Her daddy wrestled alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the president

Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the president

Meet Virginia mmm

I'll make her feel pretty again
And hold her tight
I'll make her feel like she's the only one
And everything's all right

I'll take her anywhere
I'll take her anywhere as long as she's with me
And if it gets too late
I'll make her a bed and lay her down beside me

Meet Virginia can't wait to meet Virginia mmm

Meet Virginia I can't wait

Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain cause niggas still want the fame
Off the name first of all you ain't rap long enough to be fuckin' with me
And you you ain't strong enough
Niggas is kittens the best part about it is
You're not gettin' even within the same ballpark as me
Ya' name wouldn't carry weight if I gave the bitch a U-Haul to hold
When the guns spark you'll hear the shots go off
I'm right outside of your door door
Up in here up in here
And I ain't gotta be rappin' just to get applause

How you gon' explain fuckin' a man
Even if we squashed the beef I ain't touchin' ya hand

I don't fuck with niggas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way that's the dog
I know how to get down know how to bite
Bark very little but I know how to fight
I know how to chase a cat up in a tree
Man I give y'all shit you never seen

See I'm not gonna compromise
Simply you're not worth the sacrifice
For what you won't do I'll do for myself
I'll figure it out like no one else
So whatcha gonna do
When the crowd goes "ayyy"
And you're standing on stage
With your mic in your hand
And your sweat on my Katana

About what you got and what you don't even know
And everything you're tryna be you already are
'Cause you're making me sick working so hard
Workin' so hard

Chorus:

Sayin' "boo boo"
"Leave me alone"
"Let me get my groove on"
"Let me rock you with this low tone"

Y'all know me still the same OG but I been low-key  
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese no deals and no G's  
No wheels and no keys no boats no snowmobiles and no ski's  
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries  



Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks  
To add to the wall full of plaques  
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies  
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze ho please  
You better bow down on both knees who you think taught you to smoke trees  
Who you think brought you the oldies Eazy-E's Ice Cube's and DOC's and Snoop D-O-double-G's  
And the group that said motherfuck the police  
Gave you a tape full of dope beats to bump when you stroll through in your hood  
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good  
Who's the Doc that he told you to go see  
Y'all better listen up closely all you niggas that said that I turned pop  
Or the Firm flop y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep  
So fuck y'all all of y'all if y'all don't like me blow me  
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me  



Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say  
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips  
Just a bunch of gibberish  
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre  



Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say  
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips  
Just a bunch of gibberish  
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre  



So what do you say to somebody you hate hate  
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way way  
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way then  
Just study a tape of NWA  
One day I was walkin' by  
With a Walkman on  
When I caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye  
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot  
With his Karl Kani  
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not  
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge  
When I'm drunk as fuck  
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage  
Hoppin' out with two broken legs  
Tryna walk it off  
Fuck you too bitch call the cops  
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs  
And when the cops came through  
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house  
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches  
And still weren't found out  



Right here we go  
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say  
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips  
Just a bunch of gibberish  
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre  



Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say  
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips  
Just a bunch of gibberish  
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre  



If it's all good playa playa it's all good  
I'm still Dre da same OG but I been low key  
Hated on by most these niggas witcha no cheese no deals and no G's no wheels and no keys  
No boats no snowmobiles and no skiis  
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries  
Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks  
To add to the wall full of plaques  
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies  
This is the life that I chose  
Chose chose
I wanna know
Whoever told you I was letting go
Of the only joy that I have ever known
Girl they're lying

Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Just giving up they wanna let it go
But we're still trying

So you should know this love we share was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one-way street just you and I
Just you and I

I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swear to you my love will remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swear to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

All over again

Some people say
That everything has got its way of playing out
Thoughts of the future they can make you laugh and cry
Don't you worry 'bout life it goes on

And life's only just begun

Baby don't you look back no no

I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swear to you my love will remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swear to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

All over again

The more I know of you is the more I know I love you
And the more that I'm sure I want you forever and ever more

And the more that you love me the more that I know
Oh that I'm never gonna let you go

Gotta let you know that I
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swear to you my love will remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swear to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry

Where do I go
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know still I miss you somehow
From the bottom of my broken heart

There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart

Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love I never knew love
Til' there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

"Baby" I said "please stay
Give our love a chance for one more day"
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about
But you put a dart through my dreams
Through my heart and I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end
You promised me love you promised me then
And still I miss you somehow

From the bottom of my broken heart

There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart

Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love I never knew love
Til' there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

Oh baby I said you were my first love oh oh
Even though my heart will try to pull my dreams apart oh no
I still love you forever forever and ever babe
From the bottom of my broken heart
From the bottom of my broken
From the bottom of my broken heart"
Verse 1:
When you feel all alone
And the world has turned it's back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild wild heart
I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold
When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you can't take anymore

Chorus:
Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

Verse 2:
When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one way street
With the monsters in your head
When hopes and dreams are far away and
You feel like you can't face the day
Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night

Chorus:
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

Bridge:
Because there has always been heartache and pain
And when it's over you'll breathe again
You'll breathe again
When you feel all alone
And the world has turned it's back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild wild heart

Chorus:
Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone
Verse 1:
I said "Hey do you have a minute or two"
He said "Yeah what do you need"
I said "I wanna shut the door and take the phone off the hook
So nobody can interrupt me"

Pre-chorus 1:
He said "Well my boss is a jerk and he's got me workin' right now
But I think I can talk you out of bein' mad"

Chorus:
I said "Doctor can you give me somethin' for the pain
I'm feelin' bad and it's drivin' me insane
And I know you can make it go away
If you just give me somethin' for the pain"

Verse 2:
He said "You shouldn't take those things you see on TV
They only bring you down"
I said "You don't know just what it's like to be me

He said "Well my love life's a joke and my credit's been revoked
But I think I can help you find a way"

Don't you understand
I need a shot of salvation in my veins"
He said "Hey do you want a prescription for some happy pills
Well I can't give you what you want but I can give you what you need"

Chorus:
I said "Doctor can you give me somethin' for the pain
I'm feelin' bad and it's drivin' me insane
And I know you can make it go away
If you just give me somethin' for the pain"
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Best Day" by George Strait:

I'm five years old and it's getting cold
I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now and don't know how
My friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight
And grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we find a town
Far enough away
And we talk and window-shop
Until I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine and I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say that I had the best day with you today
Verse 1:
I said I left my baby girl a message
Saying I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me

Chorus:
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time
To be alone
But when you love someone you just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave

Verse 2:
She's crying her heart to me
How can you let this be
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

Chorus:
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time
To be alone
But when you love someone you just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave

Bridge:
She's crying softly while I'm deciding
To stay or leave to do right or wrong
She says I'm not ready but I'm ready
To move on but do I leave or stay
Cause the love we shared made me so strong

Chorus:
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time
To be alone
But when you love someone you just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave

Outro:
We've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I gotta breathe
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "My Best Friend" by Tim McGraw:

I never had no one
I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
'Til you walked into my life
It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time
I didn't feel alone in my life

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

You're my best friend
Oh yeah you stand by me
And you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble
When we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

You're my best friend
You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

You're my best friend
Oh you're my best friend
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Broadway" by Goo Goo Dolls:

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight
See the young man sittin' in the old man's bar
Waitin' for his turn to die
The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls
Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world
Like it's someplace that you've been
You see it all thru' your window
On to the streets below
Broadway is dark tonight

Broadway is dark tonight

A poets' gut reaction is to search his very soul
So much confusion before his eyes
He takes his possibilities and throws them all away
To mingle with the drifters and the losers in the game
The artist peers defiantly thru' his tiny windowpane
And says it doesn't look like much
I'll miss the terrace view
Of the innocent young lovers

Fighting out in the street
Broadway is dark tonight
Ain't no human tragedy
Ain't no human tragedy
spoken
Ha Ha No philosophical/political content

Uh oh
Big baller
The shot caller
Ain't nothin' up in this world bigger than
Louder than
Opportunities badder than
Geah too hot for TV
For shiggity
My homegirl told me
But they still tryin' to see
Ain't gon' never give up what I feel
I like sex 'n appeal
Ain't no shame in my game
I'm takin' a man to do thangs
Make his toes curl and his body jerk
Even though some may say I'm a flirt
Play too much or whatever
But I say I'm just tryin' to work it baby


What'chu like a whole lot of foreplay
Or make it rough and we'll just skip foreplay
Either way baby I'ma listen to what you what you want
What'chu like I can give you what you need
I'mma make your body my toy toy I'mma
Make it real for ya baby all night long


Ah check it
I hope you got a big appetite
I can refrain from doin' the things that you like to do
You know lickin' like a lollipop poppin' bubble gum
Ain't nuthin' wrong with Mimi
But I prefer hummin' baby
I'm feelin' like I want some
And I'm asking you if you want some
'Cause if you don't somebody else will
My love is too
Kill
Never playin' when it comes to this doe
And I ain't got time to be playin' no games with you
But if you want me
You gotta believe me
Then you gonna need me
And if you're lucky
I might just let you see me
But keep it on the d-low
And let nobody know baby


What'chu like a whole lot of foreplay
Or make it rough and we'll just skip foreplay
Either way baby I'ma listen to what you what you want
What'chu like I can give you what you need
I'mma make your body my toy toy I'mma
Make it real for ya baby all night long


'Cause I'm gonna give you what you need yeah yeah yeah
You know what I need you know what I want
Let me hear you say it baby let me hear you say it
Let me know what you like
And I'm gon' give it to ya tonight
You know what I need you know what I want
Let me hear you say it baby let me hear you say it
Let me know what you like
And I'm gon' give it to ya tonight


What'chu like a whole lot of foreplay
Or make it rough and we'll just skip foreplay
Either way baby I'ma listen to what you what you want

Don't think I'm not
Cause I'm guilty of the crime
I gotta a lot of things
To make up for in time
If you see me in a club
I might be acting up
Don't think I'm not


I'm the kind of girl you wanna take to ya mama's house
I'm the kinda girl who will put it on ya put it on ya
I'm the kind of girl who was raised in the south
Ya'll know what they say about me
That Kandi's a freak Kandi's a freak


Don't think I'm not
Cause I'm guilty of the crime
I gotta lot of things
To make up for in time
If you see me in a club
I might be acting up
Don't think I'm not


I'm the kinda girl who will hang with ya fellas
Drink beer play poker and always be the life of the party
I'm the kinda girl you wanna take to meet yo momma

That Kandi's a freak Kandi's a freak


Don't think I'm not
Cause I'm guilty of the crime
I gotta lot of things
To make up for in time
If you see me in a club
I might be acting up

Now see the moral of the story is
Be selective who you call your friends
Cause snakes come in all shapes and sizes
And sometimes they be those you would least expect coming
And in this particular situation
We were supposed to be down regardless you know what I mean
But instead of keepin it real
You went and spilled the beans
And I don't appreciate that
So you know what
Girlfriend don't think I'm not
I gotta lot of things to make up for
Don't think I'm not




Don't think I'm not
Cause I'm guilty of the crime

I gotta lot of things to make up for in my life oh
Don't think I'm not don't think I'm not don't think I'm not don't think I'm not
Don't think I'm not don't think I'm not don't think I'm not don't think I'm not
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance I hope you dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin'

Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance I hope you dance

Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder where those years have gone
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Dance I hope you dance

I hope you dance I hope you dance

Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder where those years have gone
Do you think you are better off alone
Do you think you are better off alone
Do you think you are better off alone
Do you think you are better off alone

Talk to me
Ooh talk to me
Talk to me
Ooh talk to me

Feel so free
What I need to be
Lies so deep inside of me
All alone

Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading
From all the things that we are
But are not saying
Can we see beyond the scars
And make it to the dawn
Change the colors of the sky
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you
What about now
What about today
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be
What if our love never went away
What if it's lost behind words we could never find
Then baby what about now
What about now
The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
Shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you
What about now
What about today
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be
What if our love never went away
What if it's lost behind words we could never find
Then baby what about now
So what about now
What about today
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be
What if our love never went away
What if it's lost behind words we could never find
Then baby what about now
What about now

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Girl on TV" by LFO:

Verse 1:
Saw you for the first time on a television screen
It was a party scene you were lying by the pool
I asked a friend of mine who you were
She said that you were on tv but that didn't comfort me
I wanted you so much you were the girl of my dreams

Chorus:
Oh oh oh you're the girl on tv
Girl on tv
My whole world revolves around you
I'm like a satellite and you're the sky

Verse 2:
I never thought that you could feel the same
But then one day I saw you walking down my street
I said "Hello" and you said "Hi"
I knew right then that I was in love with you
We went out the very next night
And everything was going just right

Oh oh oh you're the girl on tv
You're the girl on tv
My whole world revolves around you My whole world
I'm like a satellite and you're the sky

And given me a liberty

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Breathe" by Faith Hill as follows:

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
Suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know and you know
There's no need for words right now

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
Suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe
Just breathe
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
Every time our eyes meet

This feeling inside me

Is almost more than I can take

Baby when you touch me

I can feel how much you love me

And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone or anything

I can hear your thoughts I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do

I'm so in love with you

It just keeps getting better

I wanna spend the rest of my life

With you by my side

Forever and ever

Every little thing that you do

Baby I'm amazed by you
Verse 1:
Walking down the beach
With a transistor radio
Laughing and a jokin'
And a havin' some fun
Blastin' out the summer songs
Radio's on
We're tuned in
But there's something wrong

Chorus:
You sang to me
Oh how you sang to me
Girl you hit me like a hurricane
And I don't wanna be the same again
You sang to me
Oh how you sang to me
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for
I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to beme

Verse 2:
Down on the beach
We sat together in the sand
But I saw you lookin' at me
Girl you made me understand
The way you brushed your hair from your face
I love the way you smile
And I could look into your eyes forever
Just listen to the way you sing tonight

Chorus:
You sang to me
Oh how you sang to me
Girl you hit me like a hurricane
And I don't wanna be the same again
You sang to me
Oh how you sang to me
You got me skippin' town everytime
I hear those lips that say goodbye
I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But I'm down and I miss you all the time
Just listen and don't hang up
I'm calling you at midnight in Paris
Forgetting about the sunrise
This time I'm lost without you

Bridge:
So baby stay with me tonight
And forget about tomorrow
I'll hold you tight I'll make you feel alright
Cause there's something in your eyes
That tells me tomorrow will be alright

Chorus:
You sang to me
Oh how you sang to me
Girl you hit me like a hurricane
And I don't wanna be the same again
You sang to me
Oh how you sang to me
You got me dreaming of a life
That anybody else would die for
Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Absolutely Story of a Girl" by Nine Days:

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many days in a year
She woke up with hope but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real

As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear
When you look in the mirror so how do you choose

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this kind of day
She slips and she falls and she feels like it's all wrong
But she knows she's a little bit stronger now

She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all that she can never be
She wades in insecurity

And hides herself inside of me

Don't you know she's not the only one
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles
I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Be with You" by Enrique Iglesias:

Monday night and I feel so low
I count the hours but they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice can save my soul
City lights streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast and it feels so cold
And I'm all alone don't know where to go

But tonite I feel like I wanna be with you
Tonite I wanna lay in your arms
Tonite I feel like I wanna be with you
Tonite tonite

Be with you be with you
Won't you be with me tonite
I'm staring into space
And it's making me scared
I'm feeling like I need to find
A place where I can hide

You're the only one
Who really knows me at all

But tonite I feel like I wanna be with you
Tonite I wanna lay in your arms
Tonite I feel like I wanna be with you
Tonite I wanna lay in your arms

Be with you be with you
Won't you be with me tonite
Be with you be with you
Won't you be with me tonite

I can't believe that I'm here
Just to be with you
And I'm gonna love you no matter what it takes
I've gotta find a way to you

Tonite I feel like I wanna be with you
Tonite I wanna lay in your arms
Tonite I feel like I wanna be with you
Tonite tonite

Be with you be with you
Won't you be with me tonite
All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching waiting commiserating
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Late night come home
Work sucks I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Keep your head still I'll be your thrill
The night will go on my little windmill
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Keep your head still I'll be your thrill
The night will go on the night will go on
My little windmill
Verse 1:
I don't need a lot of things
I can get by with nothing
Of all the blessings life can bring
I've always needed something

Verse 2:
But I've got all I want
When it comes to loving you
You're my only reason you're my only truth

Chorus:
I need you like water like breath like rain
I need you like mercy from heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms that carries me through
I need you

Verse 3:
You're the hope that moves me
To courage again
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds rage

Bridge:
And it's so amazing
'Cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now
'Cause you've brought me too far

Chorus:
I need you like water like breath like rain
I need you like mercy from heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms that carries me through
I need you

Outro:
Oh yes I do
I need you

And the stacks keep comin' comin' and the stacks keep comin' comin'
And the stacks keep comin' comin' and the stacks keep comin'
To the to the drum of the drum

I can provide the uncensored lyrics of "Cowboy Take Me Away" by Dixie Chicks:

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon and not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one for miles and miles
Except for maybe you and your simple smile
Oh it sounds good to me yes it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I wanna feel the sunshine
I wanna smell the piney air
I wanna taste the moonshine
And feel the sweet breeze in my hair
I wanna be the only one for miles and miles
Except for maybe you and your simple smile
Oh it sounds good to me yes it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I said cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "I Don't Wanna" by Aaliyah:


Got somebody she's a beauty
Very special really and truly


Take good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right here with me that's the beauty
If ya man can't please you then remember me
Tell it to your man I don't wanna hear his shit
'Specially if you broke it off and decided to dip
Take a trip let me put you in the whip
Take a sip make a toast tell me what's the occasion


I don't wanna be
On the receiving end of your none of your love


Is that what you're telling me You're triggered by the thought of me with somebody
I don't wanna feel what you're feeling
Somebody told me that love equals dealing
I don't wanna deal with that with you or nobody
I'm closed for situations love's off the market
I don't wanna talk to you more than a casual conversation
Leave me alone get off my line
And when you see me in the club don't even check for me
Just give me respect and I'll give respect


I don't wanna be
On the receiving end of your none of your love


Got somebody else she's a beauty
Very special really and truly
Take good care with me like it's her duty
Want you right here with me that's the beauty
Verse 1:
I'm feelin' strange 
I'm seeing stars 
I think I'm falling 
It's coming hard 
I felt this rush 
Before tonight 
I'm feeling sweated 
So in my mind 
Pre-Chorus:
Should I stay here 
Or go back home 
I never thought 
I'd spend the night alone 
Chorus:
Said baby 
Gotta tell you how I feel 
Hey you 
I'm like a fire 
The way I feel tonight 
Gotta tell you 
Gotta tell you 
Verse 2:
I'm getting closer 
To the door 
I'm all worked up 
I need much more 
The night is young 
And so are we 
I'll make you feel 
Like you're in a dream 
Pre-Chorus:
Should I stay here 
Or go back home 
I never thought 
I'd spend the night alone 
Chorus:
Said baby

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect it's passion it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life
Chorus
Waiting for tonight oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
Chorus
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
Chorus

There you are lookin' at me
Tell me what you want this to be
It could be everything that your heart desires
All you got to do is stick around for awhile


There's so many things that I want to do want to do
Take you all around;show you I'm the one for you for you
And if you give me a chance I can love you right
But you're tellin' me it's just not enough


What you want from me

I'll bring it all to you to you

I was there just waiting for my time to come around
So I could love you up and keep you satisfied
But you're tellin' me that my love ain't truly blind
So I'm gonna give my love to a better guy

See first of all
I know these so-called playas wouldn't tell you this
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start yeah

Chorus:
When I think about all these years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far/When I think about where we would be if we were to just fall apart
And I just can't stand the thought of leaving you darling
Don't you know we're stronger together/And I just can't see myself living without you no
And I'll be miserable without you

Verse 2:
We've been together for so long baby it's just too hard to just throw all of that away
Nobody else can do me like you do
I can't imagine myself loving nobody else
I know we got issues but I'd rather work on this with you than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you're here with me I know that I'll be alright

Chorus:
When I think about all these years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far/When I think about where we would be if we were to just fall apart
And I just can't stand the thought of leaving you darling
Don't you know we're stronger together/And I just can't see myself living without you no
And I'll be miserable without you

Bridge:
See we've done some things that we regret but we live we learn we love and then we forget
And I know it's hard but baby don't give up on me
As for as I can see we've been through too much but good rough times outweigh the bad for us to just walk away

Chorus:
When I think about all these years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far/When I think about where we would be if we were to just fall apart
And I just can't stand the thought of leaving you darling
Don't you know we're stronger together/And I just can't see myself living without you no
And I'll be miserable without you/And I'll be miserable without you

Come on and dance with me

Everything we need is on the floor
Please don't let me go

Take my hand and I'll lead you to salvation

The clothes I'm wearing I've bought it
The rock I'm rockin' I've bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearin' I've bought it
The house I live in I've bought it
The car I'm driving I've bought it
I depend on me I depend on me

All the women who independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Girlfriends you know you better watch out
Some guys some guys are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Holla at me if you're that kinda man
I'ma treat you right

All the women who independent

We know that we're blessed and we still here standing tall
We've been away for a while now we're back to give you more


No more baby I'ma do right

But it seems that you got me in a twist
I thought that we was something special
But we ain't been that close since our first kiss


No more baby I'ma do right
No more baby I'ma do right
No more baby I'ma do right
No more baby I'ma do right
Verse 1:
I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the fifty yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valadictorian so
Under your number I wrote "call for a good time"

Chorus:
I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

Verse 2:
When I was a dreamer I schemed and bought all my fantasies
Come to life
And though my dreams have come and gone
And my songs have been sold
I'm still on the outsides of your high-walled world

Chorus:
I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

Bridge:
Now I guess I could have made it better
If I'dve gone home cried in my sleep
But instead I took off to find out what I could take
Never thinking I'd be the one who was naked

Instrumental break

Chorus:
I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

Outro:
I'm naked now you're outta sight
I'm out of mind
But I'll get you revenge yet
And I hope you're satisfied

Hey hey
Bye bye bye
Bye bye


I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on


I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone


I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye


I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone


I just wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye


I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone


I'm just kidding myself babe
It's you that I love
No more no more
I'm just gonna be true to myself


I loved you endlessly
Well darling don't you know that
I made a vow I'll never be untrue to you


I loved you endlessly
I said I'm sorry Bye bye bye
I'm sorry Bye bye bye
I'm sorry Bye bye bye
I'm sorry Bye bye

Mmm I'm goin' down down baby yo' street in a Range Rover c'mon
Street sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go HOT SHIT
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff pass it to me now

Street sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what Listen to it pound

I'm goin' down down baby yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go I like the way you work that
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff pass it to me now
You can find me in St Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs blowin' up like double bucks
Sippin' Bud gettin' perved and gettin' dubbed
Daps and hugs mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because uh



Check it check it check it uhh
I'm the king of the city you can call me loco
And when it's time for the po-po they call me Jose
Twenty-two years old addicted to a velour
And nineteen sixty four impalas
Tip down chrome on the hydro
Seat belted mocked up shined up wheels and tires
I-D-E-R-C-by-fo-fum
I smell smoke in the air must be time for me to go



You got a piece of me and honestly
My life would suck without you
