Go Shawty it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a f\*\*\*
It's not your birthday


You can find me in the club bottle full of Bud
Mama I got what you need if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having s\*\*\* I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed


When I pull out up front you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep it's twenty knives in the club
N\*\*\*a yous a p\*\*\*y and I ain't into that
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed


Don't try to act like you don't know where we been either n\*\*\*a
In the club all the time f\*\*\*n' with me
And you tellin' me you're not a groupie
It's clear to me n\*\*\*a that you're probably gay
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed


Go go go go go go
Go shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a f\*\*\*
It's not your birthday


Now I'm tipsy off the Bud so I'm about to get my buzz
I'm standing on the couch I'm dancing all up on the club
I'm leaving with a h\*\*\* and I'm leaving with her friend
They were both born in '86 woo


And then I'll hit it again nuh
I'm in the hills still sippin' on livin'
I'm checking out the chick and she got a t\*\*\* on her
If your OG don't know me then don't talk to me punk


I'm in the club every weekend baby workin' off the plug
Tryna find me a h\*\*\* to come back to the pad and rub
Swimming in condoms a pool full of rubbers
I'm already into getting s\*\*\* so come give me a hug


Go go go go go go
Go shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a f\*\*\*
It's not your birthday
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Ignition" by R Kelly:


Now uh usually I don't do this but uh
Go ahead on and break 'em off with a little preview of the remix


I'm not tryna be rude
But hey pretty girl I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do
Reminds me of my Lexus coupe
That's why I'm all up in your grill
Tryna get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field


So baby gimme that toot toot
Lemme give ya that beep beep
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fours
While they sayin' on the radio
"It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'"
Sippin' on coke and rum
I'm like "So what I'm drunk"
It's the freakin' weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun


Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce


Now it's like murder she wrote
Once I get you out them clothes
Privacy's on the door
Still they can hear you screamin' "more"
Girl I'm feelin' what you feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin'
I'm about to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition


So give me that toot toot
Lemme give ya that beep beep
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fours
While they sayin' on the radio
"It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'"
Sippin' on coke and rum
I'm like "So what I'm drunk"
It's the freakin' weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun


Cristal poppin' in the stretch Navigator
We got food everywhere as if the party was catered
We got fellas to my left honeys on my right
We bring 'em both together we got drinkin' all night


Then after the show it's the after-party
And after the party it's the hotel lobby
Yeah around about four you gotta clear the lobby
Then take it to your room and freak somebody


Can I get a toot toot
Boy can I get a beep beep
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fours
While they sayin' on the radio
"It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'"
Sippin' on coke and rum
I'm like "So what I'm drunk"
It's the freakin' weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun


It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum
I'm like "So what I'm drunk"
It's the freakin' weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun
Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce

There you go:

There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
Somewhere in this darkness there's a light that I can't find
Maybe it's too far away or maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Love me when I'm gone

When your education x-ray cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends
Roaming through this darkness I'm alive but I'm alone
Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Love me when I'm gone

When I'm gone

When I'm gone

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone

Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good

So hold me when I'm here right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone

Love me when I'm gone

When I'm gone
All day staring at the ceiling
Making friends with shadows on my wall
All night hearing voices telling me
That I should get some sleep because tomorrow might be good for something
Hold on feeling like I'm headed for a breakdown
And I don't know why

But I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be yeah

I'm talking to myself in public
Dodging glances on the train
And I know I know they've all been talking 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
Out of all the hours thinking
Somehow I've lost my mind

But I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talking in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah they're taking me away
Hey how I disappeared
Well I ain't been missing no
I've been lying here all along

But I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell
I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Yeah how I used to be
How I used to be
Well I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
How I used to be

Said I've been needing you wanting you
Said I need you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you


Off to college yes you went away
Straight from high school you up and left me
We were close friends also lovers
Did everything for one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back to me can you hear me Callin'
Aye-aye aye-aye I miss you


It's kinda hard with you not around Yeah
Know you in heaven smilin' down Eh
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Everyday we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define Can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6 shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin' hits stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone Can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death


Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin' of the day thinkin' of the day
When you went away when you went away
What a life to take what a life to take
What a bond to break what a bond to break
I'll be missing you


If you listen to the song I sing
You will understand listen to the song I sing
You hold a key to my heart
And you're my everything
Aye-aye aye-aye Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

Thinking of the day missing you
When you went away missing you
What a life to take missing you
What a bond to break missing you
I'll be missing you
How can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up Wake me up inside
I can't wake up Wake me up inside
Save me Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up Before I come undone
Save me Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life
Wake me up Wake me up inside
I can't wake up Wake me up inside
Save me Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up Before I come undone
Save me Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love darling
Only you are the life among the dead
All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Don't let me die here
Rest in peace Inside your mind
Come to life Wake me up inside
Wake me up Wake me up inside
I can't wake up Wake me up inside
Save me Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up Before I come undone
Save me Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life Bring me to life
Bring me to life

Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
GirlIt's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still have love for me
Girl


If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
would you poof and disappear like some of my friends
If I'm broke and I'm famished would you be by my side
And if I couldn't provide someday would you change your mind


I need to knowYou stressin' me out
Must find a reason to let you know
That I'm thankful for every way you've shown


Love is life and life is living
It's very special


If you love meyou'll buy me diamonds and rubies and
pearls
If you love meyou'll provide me with the finer
things in this world oh yeah


If I wasn't rappin' baby would you be attracted to me
And if I wasn't six-four would you still wanna date me
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty would it be alright Come and ride with me
If I showed up in your crib would you hesitate to
hug me or would you fall down to your knees
And show gratitude towards me Kiss my feet
If I gave you diamonds and pearl
Would you be a nasty girl and do it up
for me one time Brrr


I need to know right now
Do you love me
Are you sure
Would you still love me if I didn't smell so good
Or didn't have that money
Would you still love me
If I fell off tomorrow
If I was just broke but my heart was rich
Baby would you still love me
If I didn't have a dime baby
would you still be mine lady
If I fell off tomorrow
if I was just poor unemployed and broke
Would you forsake me
If I fell off tomorrow
if I didn't have nothin'
baby would you be around
If I got locked up and sentenced to
a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side
If it was time to put in work would you be
down to ride to the very end

Just say the word and I'll be there


Right here at home
To be with you I'll fly


Everything that I do is for you


Just to show you how much I'm in love with you


It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy but oh baby
It don't matter whatever don't phase me


I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute don't bounce baby let's talk about this man


Well I'm bouncin' and I'm out son
I gotta leave you alone


'Cause I'm good holdin' down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block


Now I'm good I got me a real man


I said I'm good you know I'm good


And it don't matter what you do


JL uh JL uh


It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy but oh baby
It don't matter whatever don't phase me


I don't want you no more


Ha-ha


I don't need you


Uh-huh


What's the point


L let's go


I'ma do bad all by myself


Uh uh uh


I ain't got to be nothin' else


Yeah yeah yeah


'Cause I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good


It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy but oh baby
It don't matter whatever don't phase me


Uh-huh
We'll always be together baby
We'll always be together baby


It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy but oh baby
It don't matter whatever don't phase me
Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes words can't bring me down
Oh no so don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone left the puzzle undone

Ain't that the way it is

'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes words can't bring you down oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do
no matter what we do
No matter what we say
no matter what we say
We're the song that's out of tune
full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go
and everywhere we go
The sun will always shine
the sun will always always shine

But tomorrow we might awake on the other side
'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes words won't bring us down no-o-o
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes words can't bring us down oh no
So don't you bring me down today
Oh yeah don't you bring me down today
Don't you bring me down today

As long as you want
You know I got it

Verse 2: Mariah Carey
We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like sugar and chocolate
Affectionate chatter
Late night phone calls
How it started was
We both had a crush on each other
I used to see you in your crew
You'd be like "What up girl"
I'd be like "What up dude"
You kept it real with me
I kept it real with you
But I gotta know
How much you're serious
Trust me boy I'm curious

Chorus: Mariah Carey
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Verse 3: Busta Rhymes
We been sidetracked
Bumpin' heads and the shit get bad
But every time we talk
We make up fast
And in-between that time
We sex and laugh
We share
Get back in the shower
Get over here
And we gon' do it again
And my my
You're a tiger
Go ahead raw
You know I like it when
You're rowdy
With your hands all over me
Baby let me know
That you want me

Chorus: Busta Rhymes and Mariah Carey
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me

You know I got it

Verse 4: Spliff Starr
Yeah ayo
Flipmode
Shorty got it goin' on
A sawed-off wicked
Like them hotties in pornos
Thick lil' ghetto chick
Runnin' around gettin' naughty
All on my good and my merry
'Cause God Almighty
You're making me hard
And my blood pressure's risin'
Quick to get up in them drawers
And I'll do it without a problem
From the back to the side
To the top of the ride
And I do it again
And keep on bumpin' and grindin'

Verse 5: Rampage
Now you wanna see your man layin'
With the back blown out
Makin' ya love the way I sag my jeans
And put it on you true
No need to be insecure
When you got Missy and Mariah
And even when you're gone
We're gonna bone by the phone
I'll be waitin' on you to come
And when I'm home alone
I'll just play with my own
And my friends on the low
Is callin' your friends
And we'll do it again

Chorus: Mariah Carey
Baby if you give it to me

Outro: Mariah Carey
I know you need it
I know you want it
I know you love it
I know you need it
I know you want it
I know you love it
I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothin' but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
Won't somebody come take me home
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I'm I'm with you yeah
I'm with you yeah

Why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
Won't somebody come take me home
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I'm I'm with you yeah
I'm with you yeah

Oh why oh why
Oh why

So go ahead and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a sky scraper like a sky scraper

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
Won't somebody come take me home
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I'm I'm with you yeah
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I'm with you yeah

Day after day I'm more confused
Yet I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
And I'm feelin' the strain ain't it a shame

chorus 
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginnin' to think that I'm wastin' time
And I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
Now I'm countin' on you to carry me through

chorus
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along makin' me strong

You keep them benji's spinnin' and the next time we in the benz
I'll be ya toe touchin' friend And your neck so fat

What's wrong with the world mama ¡woo
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring the trauma


Overseas yeah we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK


But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate yeah


Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all y'all


People killin' people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek


Father father father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me got me questionin'
Where is the love Love
Where is the love The love
Where is the love The love
Where is the love
The love the love


It just ain't the same always unchanged
New days are strange is the world insane
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret and swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love yeah


Where's the love y'all Come on I don't know
Where's the truth y'all Come on I don't know
And where's the love y'all


Father father father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me got me questionin'
Where is the love Love
Where is the love The love
Where is the love The love
Where is the love
The love the love


I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting their young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo' whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness in equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive until love is found
Tell me just what you want me to be
One kiss and boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me why don't you come around no more
Cause right now I'm crying outside the door of your candy store
It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you my babe
It's all in the game of love
This what happens when two worlds collide
You're staring at me like I'm some kind of alien
Don't freak out it's okay
Cause it's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love
You roll me
Control me
Console me
Please hold me
You guide me
Divide me
Into what
Please don't leave me
We've got this king size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's karma sutra show and tell
Woah woah woah
It's all in the game of love
It's all in the game of love
It's all in the game of love
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
He's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out times up over blaow
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked he's so mad that he
Won't give up that easy no he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter he's dope he knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant he knows when he goes back to his mobile home that's when its
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
The souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads God only knows
He's grown farther from home he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose its old partner' but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da

Aw baby aw baby yeah murda inc
I wanna love you babe


Umm uhh yeah yeah yeah
I can't deny it I really wanna love you
And I'ma get the courage up to ask you
I want to know your name your number and if I can come over and
I wanna love you feel you wrap myself around you
I wanna squeeze you please you I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I'll let it go


I'm so excited I just can't hide it
You got me burning up I'm bout to lose control and I
I love the way you rock wit me baby
You put it down so good wanna be your girl 'cause


Your love is always on my mind
I can't deny it I'm so excited oh
Boy it seems like everywhere I go I see you from your eyes
Your smile it's like I breathe you helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you
Boy I try to catch myself but I'm outta control
 and I try to ignore it

You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down no

You don't have to say what you did
I already know I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be

Don't it make you sad about it

You told me you loved me
Why'd you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn
To cry

Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er
Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er yea yea

I know that they say
That some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
All of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head
Messin' with my head
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

You don't have to say what you did
I know I know
Already know I found out from him
I know I know
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
No chance
There'll never be

I can't believe it
You're coming back to me
But still you're on your knees
And cryin' "Cryin' ohhh"
Cryin' "Cryin' ohhh"
Cryin' "Cryin' ohhh"

You don't have to say what you did
I already know I found out from him
Now there's just no chance

Don't it make you sad about it

Verse 1
You shoulda known by now that it's going down
I saw you dancing and girl I came around
Got you on my mind actually
Spent precious time to make my plans
Girl you're my wine you're my cheese you're my everything
I want you for my beauty queen 'cause you give me that special feeling
I would bring the moon right down to our bed

Chorus
Ooh baby you give me that feeling
That special feeling
Girl you know what I'm talking about
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
'Cause now it's blazing what we both been craving
Girl you know I won't let you down
No letting go no holding back
Because you are my lady
Verse 2
All out tonight just to see you dance
I'm stepping closer we are face to face
Breathing heavily your scent divine
Girl I know I'm climbing higher higher
You let me know our conversations ain't so tight
No matter how much I might try you never read between the lines
But when the sun goes down and your mind gets a little dim
I could be the man that make you feel shining shining

Chorus
Ooh baby you give me that feeling
That special feeling
Girl you know what I'm talking about
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight

Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me I'm sorry but
So you think about a chance
You find yourself tryna do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me Uh you do it well

So then we tried tried to figure out why
Why why
Why why
Why why

Lemme hear that back
Sweetie you're feelin' me
The pain is shed off I'm in the game already
Been said I was cold don't you agree
That you need a ticket to freeze alright alright
In other words Jigga's not for the cheese
I'm for the rooftops guns in the high reach
And yes yours truly I'm on
From the bottom to the top
The omnipotent Hov' I'm in

So then we tried tried to figure out why
Why why
Why why
Why why

Ladies and gentlemen
The most incredible Pharrell and Jay-Z
Goddess of ice All white hot
I'm talking about a girl that look like Scarlett Johansson
But said her name was Lisa Lisa
Lisa liked expensive things
Expensive rings what else
Expensive cars what else
Expensive habits like
Expensively talkin'
But we shared somethin' in common
We both heartbroken that's right
And I ask "Why you gotta be here Why"

So then we tried tried to figure out why
Why why
Why why
Why why
I took my love I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh mirror in the sky what is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Well I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too yeah

How hard she rides wit' me the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together how they gon' stop both us
What ever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde Hov' and B holla

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck

Riding with a hundred K and my speakers blow
Some of y'all minor

Shut down all these trials
And I'm the one that paid the mediator

I'll do my best to provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Calling All Angels" by Train:

I need a sign to let me know you're here  
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere  
I need to know that things are gonna look up  
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup  

When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head  
When you feel the world shake from the words that are said  

I need a sign to let me know you're here  
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear  
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me  
And I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels  

When children have to play inside so they don't disappear  
While private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years  
And football teams are kissing Queens  
And losing sight of having dreams  

In a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours  

I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels  
I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels  

And when the children tell you  
They have seen the war on the hill  
Cause they can't understand  
And they're just standing still  

I need a sign to let me know you're here  
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear  
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me  
I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels  
I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels  

I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels  
I'm calling all angels  
I'm calling all you angels

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "This Is the Night" by Clay Aiken below:

Verse 1:
Lost in a dream I don't know which way to go 
If you are all that you seem then baby I'm movin' way too slow 

Pre-Chorus:
I've been a fool before wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door 
How about some information please 

Chorus:
Straight up now tell me do you really wanna love me forever 
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run 
Straight up now tell me is it gonna be you and me together 
Or are you just havin' fun 

Verse 2:
Time's standing still waiting for some small clue 
I keep getting chills when I think your love is true 

Pre-Chorus:
I've been a fool before wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door 
How about some information please 

Chorus:
Straight up now tell me do you really wanna love me forever 
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run 
Straight up now tell me is it gonna be you and me together 
Or are you just havin' fun

You know the way to make me lose my mind 
Why don't you tell me boy come on tell me baby 
I really need to know right now tell me baby 
'Cause I don't know how tell me baby 

Chorus:
Straight up now tell me do you really wanna love me forever 
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run

Tell me baby tell me straight up now tell me 
Tell me baby tell me straight up now tell me 
Tell me baby tell me straight up now tell me 
Tell me baby tell me straight up now tell me
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

Cause if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be awhile

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

If you want love
We'll make it
Swimming in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be awhile

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland

Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Your body is a wonderland

How you ain't gon' fuck Bitch I'm me
I'm the God damn reason you in VIP
CEO you don't have to see ID
I'm young wild and strapped like Chi-Ali
Blow 'bout two G's dolla worth of bubbles
The E's cost me a Chevy worth of money Y'all
Your clique against my clique can't be serious
Me and my niggas smoke so much we need a bus yo
So much paper I'm havin' bank withdrawals
Married to the money a true cash cow
Plus I'm fresh as hell I got a shoe fetish
Be damn if I let a bitch breathin' with my air
Chris Lova Lova I'm the one they call Ludacris
And I'm a vet and I'm ready to bone let's go which one of y'all


Ain't heard hip-hop like this in so many years
I got 'em locked then I rocked from the rear
Anything catered can't be faded
I'm levitating I'm heavily medicated
Ironic Shoulda been my name
Instead mama gave me Shawnna the name's still the same
Pop champagne to this a quarter past 3
And still they can't stop the queen bee
So what's it gon' be
Violate me and try anyway it's all good
Ya might as well compliment the chef and eat good
This is a southern rule boys and girls
Do what you like and live for this world


Stand up stand up
Stand up stand up
Just like that
Stand up stand up
And you'll never go down
Stand up stand up
Just like that

Stand up stand up
And you'll never go down
Stand up stand up
Just like that
Stand up stand up
And you'll never go down


I be rollin' like a superstar
Piece and chain plus I got my roof off
And if I'm driving you know it's with a boss
My trunk beat like a Joey that's got Parkinson's
Up and down like a roller coaster
Paint change got you feelin' like a pothead
Lean to the side yo' sir disrespect
The flow so sick I need help like Ray Charles
Peace and love the last two and a half hours
And all I'm tryna do is hit the club and get bout five or six of them broads up in my Chevy
But in the meantime it's jackin' these haters
And making them best of the situation and gettin' money man


I'm knowin' these niggas ain't prepared
Fo' fuckin' with Shawnna they better off scared
Cause I'm fully loaded and I'm 'bout to explode
Put the squeeze on 'em like a python and then let 'em go
Now everywhere I go I flex
Ask about Shawna and they'll tell ya she's up next
And I'm so cool and I'm so fly
And I don't even try to be it just happens guy
And I'm so high and I'm so nice
And you could be a hater but you're not gon' stop my price
And I'm a bad chick and I'm rollin' with's' undivided attention
And I'm killin' these bitches' with's' lyrics they never got


Stand up stand up
Now everytime I spit the truth comes out
Stand up stand up
And everytime I ride I rep the south
Just like that
And nothin' in my life has come easy
So when I'm spittin' in the booth believe me it ain't greasy
And bein' Weezy F Baby's eased me
Standin' on top of the box yellin' fly be free
So what's it gon' be
Did you come to this bar alone or did ya come with me

Hell I'm here for whatever man you know I'm just tryna cut
All right well let's go then


Stand up stand up

And you'll never go down
Stand up stand up
Just like that
Stand up stand up
And you'll never go down
Well I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July
Freedom ring now something on the surface it stinks
I said something on the surface
Well it kind of makes me nervous
Who says that you deserve this
And what kind of god would serve this
We will cure this dirty old disease
If you've got the poison I've got the remedy
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I say the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away
Well I heard two men talking on the radio
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
They were counting down the ways
To stab the brother in the be right back
After this the unavoidable kiss
Where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me
'Cause if you've got the poison I've got the remedy
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I say the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away
When I fall in love
I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine
And I'll tell you why
Because
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I say the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away

Whoo
Whooo
Uh yeah
Roc-A-Fella y'all
What what what
Uh yeah


Excuse me miss what's your name
Can you come hang with me
Possibly can I take you out to-night
You already know what it's gon' be


Just smoked a L wit a girl named Tanya
Same time took a flick wit my man Santana
Layin low to the flow got a triple beam dream
By the fiends that supply triple beams to the feens
Pete Nice lemon-pepper chicken and rice
Papayas and five G's bettin' gambling nights
Went from Huey Newton to havin' a shooters tutor
Like a student of myself born Soloist true to the game
I chose it instead of choosin Hoes thick like she's using roids
Pullin' me close whisperin' "Bruh move inside"
After she undid my zipper stuff my D-I-C-K in her liver
Mas' served me well mas' swerve the tails
Birds I rarely fly like to burn my cell
Keepin' it funky she had more baggage than Delta Burke
International lover figurin' I might meet anotha



Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from 


From "Bronx" uh-huh 
Big Bronx uh-huh
I used to have a little now I got a lot
I'm living in that Bel Air when ain't that the spot
See I dropped a 150 stacks on a Bentley Coupe
And I might've spent the same on a pair of shoes
But nobody's talkin' bout clothes
Do you like my flow Yeah yeah
Let me show you 'round a hollywood
Where I be actin' like I'm good
And even though I act like I'm better than y'all
I'm still from the block


Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from 


I'm from the block where
We need a G on every cyclone fence
We from the block where
Lennox Ave is like a fuckin' side-show
And we get dressed up and ride Playgirl horses
You motherfuckers is Dead-Pool we Crash Dummies
And I love to see them back to back bentleys
With the I-95 sticker on the back of them
And my squad really the biggest
Cause the roc and the la familia are no longer together
Now you yape about a Benz and I own two
Stop frontin' thought you knew I don't stunt
Give up give up cause you don't really want none


Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from 


I'm still I'm still
Styles from the hood
I'm on the beach where it's good
Watching birds play back and forth
But before they played they all asked me my net worth
It's the bad guy that everyone likes
Coming through the hood in the new blue and white kite
When I touch down everything just feels right
No matter where I'm at I'm ghetto in ice
Just liked the Queen from New York City don't forget it
She's still Jenny from the block
Can't have dreams and big schemes don't sweat it
Just strive for it you can hold it you can bet it


Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from 


Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from South South Bronx to battery boat to the top
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from From Jenny Jenny from Jenny from the block
Verse 1:

And I know there's just no use
When all your lies become your truths
And I don't care yeah yeah yeah

Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now oh yeah
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased
Are you happy now are you happy now

Chorus:

And left me with an empty plate
And you don't care about it yeah

Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now oh yeah
Would you tell it to my face

And there ain't no way — 
I'm lettin' you go now

'Cause I'm keeping you
Forever and for always

I wanna beForever and for always

I know I can I know I can
Be what I wanna be be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be I'll be where I wanna be


Be B-Boys and girls listen up
You can be anything in the world in God we trust
An architect doctor maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful leaving people in awe
Singing songs Lena Horne but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine sniffing up drugs all in her nose
Coulda died so young now looks ugly and old
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death


Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you're gonna be the best I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air and take a vow
Do it now I know I can
Be what I wanna be be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be I'll be where I wanna be


Be B-Boys and girls listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be up in the club with fake ID
Careful 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide be careful some men be
Rapists so act your age don't pretend to be
Older than you are give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth but so
Young boys you can use a lot of help you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve then say it like this


I know I can I know I can
Be what I wanna be be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can I know I can
Be what I wanna be be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be I'll be where I wanna be
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Underneath It All" by No Doubt featuring Lady Saw:


There's times where I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsals
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're

You're something else
You're really lovely underneath it all
You want to love me underneath it all
I'm really lucky underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline tonight
Don't you baby

Boy you have me feeling like this
Yo love is true and it's mine
I'm feeling lucky like a four-left clover
Whenever I'm around you I feel like I'm on cloud nine
You get me where you want me boy and I'm yours
It's like paradise when you open your doors
You got me wanting more more

Cause underneath it all
You are my real Prince Charming
Boy you're making me feel that I'm guilty
Cause underneath it all
You are the real Prince Charming

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline tonight
Don't you baby

So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better better better oh

You know some real bad tricks
But you need some discipline tonight
Don't you baby
You know some real bad tricks
But you need some discipline tonight
Don't you baby Don't you baby

Cause baby when you're near
It's like relief to my soul
You need to know I've got you tonight
Cause baby when you're here
It's like a brighter light shines on me
You need to know I'm shining for you
Shining for you
Shining for you
Shining for you
Shining for you
If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all
I never know what the future brings
But I know you are here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
I don't wanna run away but I can't take it I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms
If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head
If you're not for me then why does this distance make my life incomplete
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my husband
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray that you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life
I don't wanna run away but I can't take it I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms

Verse 1:
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
Leaves you alone he's with me
Do you ever wonder when he
Don't come home who he goes to see
'Cause everything he likes is with me

Chorus:
If I was your woman
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not so I can't
Then I won't but if I was your girl
The things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not so I can't
Then I won't but if I was your girl

Verse 2:
Uncontrollable bouts of passion
I've seen and done it all
When it comes to relationships
My mama's done forgot more than I'll ever know
Interested you know I made the call
Everybody said that I'll be the downfall
He wouldn't confide in me like he does to you
But he'll eat up everything I say like it's some overdue
I love how he feels his touch is unreal
His kiss is the cousin of death can't believe how it feels
He tells me everything that he won't tell you
It's obvious to see that you're gonna lose oh

Chorus:
If I was your woman
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not so I can't
Then I won't but if I was your girl
The things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not so I can't
Then I won't but if I was your girl

Bridge:
If I was your girlfriend
I'd probably be jealous of myself
If I was your girlfriend
I'd probably be jealous of myself
If I was your girlfriend
I'd probably be jealous of the women around
If I was your girlfriend

Chorus:
If I was your woman
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not so I can't
Then I won't but if I was your girl
The things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not so I can't
Then I won't but if I was your girl
The sun is hot and that old clock is moving slow
And so am I
The work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July

I'm getting paid by the hour
And older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him something
I think I'll just call it a day

Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

Oh this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
And half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay
Lord but that's all right

I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone's for me you can tell 'em I just sailed away

And pour me something tall and strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

I could pay off my tab pour myself in a cab
And be back to work before two
At a moment like this I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffet do

Funny you should ask Alan
I'd say pour me something tall and make it a "Hurricane"
Before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care

Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

I don't care it's five o'clock somewhere

So what am I not supposed to have an opinion
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what every little boy would do
Making up a few false rumors or two

That for sure is not a man to me slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls
Shout louder
Lettin' them know we're gonna stand our ground

So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can never will can't hold us down
Nobody can hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down

Never can never will

So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended with the message I'm bringing
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore

I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named
All my ladies come together & make a change
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing

This is for my girls all around the world
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls
Shout louder
Lettin' them know we're gonna stand our ground

Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can never will can't hold us down
Nobody can hold us down

Never can never will can't hold us down

Us down

Everybody's talking like they can't help theirself
But don't nobody need your help all you got to do is stop lying on yourself

Everybody's talking like they can't help theirself but don't nobody need your help
All you got to do is stop lying on yourself

This is for my girls all around the world

Sure Here are the uncensored lyrics of "My Front Porch Looking In" by Lonestar:

There's a 1940's house dress on the clothes line
Ironin' board and the washin' dimes
A flower bed of snapdragon's
Pink and purple white and blue
It's homemade jam and the rose bush
And the kitchen's always smells like Sunday
There's a "Welcome" mat at the front door
And an old Church pew on the porch
My front porch looking in
Breaking bread with mom and friends
Old men playing dominoes
Kids out chasing down the ice cream truck
Me and him he jumped up in my lap
And kiss my cheek
Nostalgia's like a cousin to me
Always good for a visit now and then
Changing leaves a family feast
Football games on TV
The raked up leaves in the backyard
My front porch looking in
Breaking bread with mom and friends
Old women making quilts
The same one's they've been making since I was a kid
Sun's going down some come around
And they take a seat and watch her shine
My front porch looking in
Oh my front porch looking in
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Angel" by Amanda Perez:

Verse 1:
It's been five months since you went away
Left without a word nothing to say
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you no

Pre-Chorus:
So I asked God God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love

Chorus:
'Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes
And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still love you
You wanna come back into my life
But now there's something I have to do

Verse 2:
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more

From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart

I won’t go through it anymore

Chorus:
Don't wanna try don't wanna try

Verse 2:
I see that look in your eyes
You think that this could be right
But I’ve been down this road
And it never ends in sight
I know you'll make someone happy

It's just my insecurities

Verse 1:
I'm just a simple girl
In a high-tech digital world
I really try to understand
All the powers that we have
To hypnotize electronically
And keep the fires of change
From burning

When it's got oxygen
And I'm exposed just naked
I'm just a girl who's trying to survive

A little bit of heaven where we can dance again
In the arms of all imaginary friends
Little earthquakes everywhere

A vision sent me I'm the girl
The one with the flag come on

Feels like I'm feels like I'm feels like I'm going

Shining like brand new

Well a man come on the 6 o'clock news
said "somebody's been shot somebody's been abused
somebody blew up a building somebody stole a car
somebody got away somebody didn't get far
they didn't get far"

Grandpappy told my pappy back in my day son
a man had to answer for the wicked that he'd done
take all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree
round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
for all the people to see

That justice is the one thing you should always find
you gotta saddle up your boys you gotta draw a hard line
when the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
and we'll all meet back at the local saloon

We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
whiskey for my men beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
too much corruption and crime in the streets
it's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
send 'em all to their maker and he'll settle 'em down

You can bet he'll set 'em down

'cause justice is the one thing you should always find
you gotta saddle up your boys you gotta draw a hard line
when the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
and we'll all meet back at the local saloon

And we'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
whiskey for my men beer for my horses

Whiskey for my men beer for my horses

 Yeah yeah yeah
The girls are all jockin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no name chump when they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy "Why you so fly" He said "Funky cold Medina"
Whoa Jealousy 'cause they all wanna get with me
From the pool to the beach you can find me
In the Holidae Inn
Come on now say it with me
Holidae Inn Hold up
Crunchy black is in gave me a freakin' grin
From the oak wood all the way to New Orleans
Been in hotel rooms feelin' rich as soon as I see the bed
It's off the chain let my niggas call me up with two or three
Holidae Inn
Put me on the three-way switch I'm in the middle
'Cause believe me they all skeet-skeet motherfucker
Let me tell you 'bout the time I was in Alief Alief
Smoothin' with some Puerto Rican chicks
Off safety with some skinny-ass white girl named Wendy
Cum 'round 12:30 gotta thank her she was kinda early
Stick my finger in some strawberry kiwi
Lay back put the joint to my lips
And when it came to that nigga neva-ev-er
Slippity-slip nigga kept talkin' shit
While he gettin' hit upside his head with the combination
We're gon' leave this bitch tip up coppertops
And git yo ass up off the wall
Out the wall out the wall


I put Ludacris' verse here 
Chorus:
So I'm-a soca na sugar sugar
How you get so fly

You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes
Off top I can't lie

In the world of of grown ups it's hard to tell
You've been taken by a playa well

Repeat Chorus

Been through bad relationships and mistreats
But that's the past I'm here to give you good lovin'
I'm a bad man I'm a bad man
I'll make you feel good let me be your numba one man

Repeat Chorus

Verse 3: Frankie J
Since I came to know ya I've been giving you a thug passion
Ghetto fairy tales you've rewinding Mo' Thug and Marion
And I know you're tired of being lonley
So baby girl put it on me
And let's rendezvous and make with this love with a passion
You're my queen and I'm your king
And you're my Puerto Rican dream - in case you don't know
And I'll hold you tighter than my Denim and that's no bull
But maybe later we can roll down the windows and let the smoke fire

Repeat Chorus x2 

Outro: Frankie J
Suga suga how you get so fly
Baby Bash Frankie J
That little mama she a pidecce of work
Suga suga how you get so fly 
And oh oh oh oh oh

Snatched from the ends of the earth sworn to my ancestors' wars
You the one I live for the one that I would die for
The one that I gave my last piece of pie for

For being beautiful inspite of all opinions tried to hide you

Bounce rock roll soul funk dope jazz
Got so much soul say girl

Verse 1:
After all you've put me through
You think I'd despise you
But in the end I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Chorus:
Well I thought I knew you thinkin' that you were true
Guess I I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up
'Cause I've had enough you were there by my side
Always down for the ride but your joyride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame mmhmm

Verse 2:
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I ohh I hold resentment for you
But uh uh oh no you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you 'cause it

Chorus:
Makes me that much stronger makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser so thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter so thanks for making me a fighter

Bridge:
Oh ohh
Never saw it coming all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I realized your game
I heard you're going 'round playin' the victim now but don't even begin
Feeling I'm the one to blame 'cause you dug your own grave

Chorus:
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you wanted to harm me but that won't work anymore
Uh no more oh no it's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you 'cause it

Makes me that much stronger makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser so thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter so thanks for making me a fighter

Outro:
Oh ohh
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na fighter

Verse 1: 2Pac

Shit tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Yo you know what I'm sayin' 'Cause I don't
At the Thugz Mansion Every corner every city
A place where death doesn't reside just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees
No cops rollin' by I get high no policemen
No homicide no chalk lines
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die I know all of my album's support her
This whole year's been crazy askin' the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together sippin' heavenly champagne
What angels saw with golden wings in Thugz Mansion

Chorus: J Phoenix & Nas

Every corner every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy laid back and cool Every hour cause it's all good
Leaves nothin' but a trace just a fine dime piece
As it should be That's how it is when you're in the 203

Verse 2: Nas

I want a place I can say "I'm from where I ain't gotta be
Somethin' I'm not just to get some love where every hood's
The same as a Cypress tree" We'd see a
I pray that it's ghetto heaven
I pray that it's ghetto heaven
Dear Lord look how hard we tryin'
Please forgive us for our stress and the best for the dyin'
And even though it's hard that's who we are oh yeah
We act like we don't care but it's so clear We're cryin' inside
I'm nothin' but a thug really
I get lost sometimes you know It's like dang
I done gave everything I got to this game you know
I done put in put blood sweat and tears you know
It's like I'm ridin' a bike that keep movin' and movin'
And I'm pedalin' I'm pedalin' and I'm pedalin'
And I can't stop now 'cause if I stop now then I'm useless
I'm nothin' Take me

Chorus: J Phoenix & Nas

Every corner every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy laid back and cool Every hour cause it's all good
Leaves nothin' but a trace just a fine dime piece
As it should be That's how it is when you're in the 203

Outro: J Phoenix

Haha Thugz Mansion huh
Y'all can come to my mansion Heh-heh
'Cause in my mansion we ain't got to do all that You ain't got to
You ain't got to wear no suit to my shit
You ain't got to lie to kick it either
Just be a boss player man you know how we do it
Aight peace
The uncensored lyrics of "Clocks" by Coldplay are:

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg I beg and plead singing

Come out of the things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tigers waiting to be tamed singing

You are you are
Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease singing

You are you are
Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know singing

Ooooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh
Ooooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh

You are you are
Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know singing

Ooooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh
Ooooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh Oooohhhhhh
  
Excuse me can I talk to you for a minute  
Uh huh sure you know you look kinda familiar  
Yeah you do too but umm I just wanted to know  
Do you know somebody named  
Oh you know his name  
Oh yeah definitely I know his name  

  
I just wanna let you know he's mine  
Don't wanna think about it no  
Or maybe just once or twice  
Thinkin' we can do it again  
Can't imagine it being him  
Feelin' guilty worried waitin'  
Stressin' but I still can't  
Live without him by my side  

  
Don't wanna think about it  
Don't wanna talk about it  
I'm just so sick about it  
Can't believe it's ending this way  
Just so confused about it  
Feelin' the blues about it  
I just can't do without ya  
Tell me is this fair  

  
Is this the way it's really goin' down  
Is this how we say goodbye  
Should've known better when you came around  
That you were gonna make me cry  
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around  
'Cause I know that you're living a lie  
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find  

  
Don't wanna think about it  
Don't wanna talk about it  
I'm just so sick about it  
Can't believe it's ending this way  
Just so confused about it  
Feelin' the blues about it  
I just can't do without ya  
Tell me is this fair  

  
Is this the way it's really goin' down  
Is this how we say goodbye  
Should've known better when you came around  
That you were gonna make me cry  

  
Don't wanna think about it  
Don't wanna talk about it  
I'm just so sick about it  
Can't believe it's ending this way  
Just so confused about it  
Feelin' the blues about it  
I just can't do without ya  
Tell me is this fair  

  
Don't wanna think about it  
Don't wanna talk about it don't wanna talk about it  
I'm just so sick about it sick about it  
Can't believe it's ending this way  
Just so confused about it  
Feelin' the blues about it  
I just can't do without ya  
Tell me is this fair
Verse 1: 
Barrel on my tongue smoke just coming out my lungs 
I hold the weight of the world on my shoulders 
My name Young Chris alright then 
I'm quick to catch a body nigga you be walking like a zombie 
But I got these mommy's 
I hit their crib beat it up properly 
I'm just playing though I really can't say no 
I gotta get this money man you already know 

Chorus: 
Can't stop won't stop 
Won't stop til we get it 
Can't stop won't stop 
Don't stop we'll never quit it 

Verse 2: 
So many nights I ain't had shit to eat 
So many days I'm just walking on my feet 
I ain't got a dime but I'm still pushing on 
Cause I gotta eat I can't go back home 
So many years I've been doing this thing 
But now I'm riding high got the world on my string 
So many haters trying to bring me down 
But I ain't going nowhere I'm a king with no crown 

Chorus: 
Can't stop won't stop 
Won't stop til we get it 
Can't stop won't stop 
Don't stop we'll never quit it 

Verse 3: 
I'm on a mission trying to get this money quick 
I'm grinding hard trying to move these bricks 
I'm taking chances trying to get ahead 
Cause the game is a gamble and I gotta make bread 
I'm living fast but I'm going to slow it down 
Cause I got a family now and I gotta hold them down 
I'm just trying to make it like every other man 
But I'm a hustler and I'm doing what I can 

Chorus: 
Can't stop won't stop 
Won't stop til we get it 
Can't stop won't stop 
Don't stop we'll never quit it 

Outro: 
We grind hard hard like diamonds 
We shine bright brighter than stars in the sky 
We never give up we never give in 
Cause we gotta win gotta get to the top
I was thinking 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinking 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get goin'
Where the hell's my truck it keys gotta be here somewhere

Oh baby what we gon' to do
We're really gettin' into this just me and you
My eyes start to roll back in my head
And I don't even remember what I said

Last thing I remember I was
Taking out a trash
Puttin' on my shoes falling asleep in the backseat
I was running behind time
But I know I was thinking' damn she looks good ring of the buzz
Thirteen miles 'til the Georgia line I was wearing thin on gasoline
Baby you're a song
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it

So baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blown' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on

Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone cold world of his own
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone cold world of his own

They're tryin' to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on dip bum on your lips fuck that
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits fuck you Debbie
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
A visionary vision of scary
Could start a revolution polluting the airwaves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask in the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back nana-na na-na-na na-na-na fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it
'Cause I've been contemplating debating whether or not I'm a be able to be the man I was
To present fiendin' for the mic I'm see-sawin'
Icicles form on my mic I'm warmin' up
Runnin' drills Mommy's not home
I'm practicing to become a dad anyway I don't have one
I'm the product of rage the Bible's a teacher said to let's and my Tommy said to swage
A neighborhood bully that likes to behave
I'm Chris Reeves son Christopher Reeve
Sometimes I feel like I got nothin' to lose
I start frontin' to avoid a confrontation
Lose my cassettes tape and only gettin' more irate
So who's starin' at the staingin' at the wall
Me and twist d' testify to having spina bifida
This is the kiss of death from underdog to top dog
So I'ma keep puffin' my chest and I'ma keep on stompin'
Sing for the moment sing for the year
Sing for the laughter sing for the tear
Sing with me if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Verse 1:
I've been up to my neck workin' six days a week
Wearin' holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreamin' of gettin' away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than nowfor Mexico

Chorus:
No shoes no shirt no problems
Blues what blueshey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shirt no shoes and no problems

Verse 2:
Babe let's get packedtank tops and flip flops if you got 'em
No destination she's just pointin' and hopin'
That the day goes slow and the sun goes down
We'll get started with a little unwind 

Chorus:
No shoes no shirt no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shirt no shoes and no problems 

Bridge:
No problems
Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Want to look through my shades and see you ther with me
Want to soak up life for a while
In laid back mode

Chorus:
No shoes no shirt no problems
Breezin' by the world's in a hurry
Up here in my coconut tree
No shoes no shirt no problems

Outro:
No problems
No problems
Yeah we're gonna take our time on this one
We're gonna do this one right

Oh you feel that I'm sexy with it
Check it out

Verse 1:
I'm sittin' lookin' out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You're still runnin' through my mind
When I'm knowin' that you shouldn't be
Me all on your mind and you wanna get with me
Well give me one good reason why I should
And I'll think about it but for now I'm good
Shit I'm doin' well for myself don't need your drama
I must admit it's appealing the thought of touchin' the ceiling
But that's the kind of feelin' that gets good men caught up
And turned into the villain well that won't be me
I'll stay alone and sufferin' free
But you can't keep coming to me

Chorus:
I'm sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved to love and be loved
I'm sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved to love and be loved

Verse 2:
Now while he's out here tryna flex
I'm sittin' at home tryna perfect my sex
I'mma break it down to the nitty gritty one time
You and me could be like Juicy Fruit aight Cool
Runnin' around like we ain't got nothin' to lose
But baby do you know what's at stake
If we get caught they won't hesitate
To put me away for a minute for my crime
But it's worth them doin' time for
'Cause with you all that I see
Is my little mama she got the looks that kill
And if I'm still standin' after the smoke clear
Then I'm tryna be with you surrounded by love and sippin' on beer
Let's convert this loot so we can ball together
Smaller than never and livin' forever

Chorus:
I'm sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved ayy
To love and be loved by you baby
I'm sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved to love and be loved

Bridge:
I'm tired of tryna love somebody that don't love me
I'm cryin' while you're out here enjoying your life
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I want you I need you I want you I need you
How can you love somebody else When you're still hung up on me

Chorus:
I'm sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved baby
To love and be loved by you to love you
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved oh baby
To love and be loved

Bridge:
I'm tired of tryna love somebody that don't love me oh yeah
I'm cryin' while you're out here enjoying your life oh yeah
I want you I need you I want you I need you
How can you love somebody else oh yeah
On a cobweb afternoon
In a room full of emptiness
By a freeway I confess
I was lost in the pages of a book full of death
Reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Anywhere we want to go

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed I will pray
To the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone
Who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised the wine was bled
And there you lead me on

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone alone

And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret
Of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed
And all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death
I will wander on

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

Alone
I waited 'til I saw the sun
I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Something has to make you run
I don't know why I didn't come
I feel as empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
Girl you know I'm from the country
And I got to say
I like a little moonlight and I like a little good times
But you're up in the city
Been working all week
And now you're calling me up
'Cause you want to get freaky

You say you're looking for someone
Who will take you higher
Baby I'm not just someone
I'm a real good man
I'm a lover and a fighter
And I'll fight for what I love
I'll be your everything
Baby let's make love

I can tell by the way you're talking
You're ready to go
I'll be waiting in my pickup
On the edge of town
We'll go way out where there ain't nobody around
We can start living our country fantasy

You say you're looking for someone
Who will take you higher
Baby I'm not just someone
I'm a real good man
I'm a lover and a fighter
And I'll fight for what I love
I'll be your everything
Baby let's make love

You say you want a touchdown
With some passion and romance
Well let me be your hero
And let me get in your pants

You say you're looking for someone
Who will take you higher
Baby I'm not just someone
I'm a real good man
I'm a lover and a fighter
And I'll fight for what I love
I'll be your everything
Baby let's make love

I'll be your everything
Baby let's make love
Verse 1:
I'm feeling sensual
Made up my mind I'm keeping my clothes on
Not gonna find me naked no
I confess I'm feeling restless
And I'm tired of being patient oh
So let's get down to business
I don't wanna waste no time

Chorus:
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes

Verse 2:
We can start at the beginning
Or we can skip right to the end
Whatever else you're thinking
I promise I'll be your friend
I don't wanna force your hand
But I'm just saying if you can

Chorus:
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes

Bridge:
I'm not trying to pressure you no
But I'm not gonna lie no
If you make me wait for too long
Might miss my chance to ride low

Chorus:
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes

Outro:
Say yes say yes say yes say yes just say yes
Say yes say yes say yes say yes just say yes

Wanna show me how you work it baby Work it
No problem get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm trying to explain baby the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl not in your hands Ha-ha

Outro: Lil' Kim
Come on get on ride the train
Boy just ride it
Come on get on ride the train
Ride it woo woo
Come on get on ride the train
Boy just ride it
Come on get on ride the train Ride it woo woo
Go go go go go go
Go shorty it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a f\*ck it's not your birthday

You can find me in the club bottle full of bub'
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed

When I pull up out front you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I f\*ck with Dre now they want to show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes they want to f\*ck

But homie ain't nothing changing hoes down G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp

In the hood in LA they saying "50 you hot"
They like me I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold

I'm fully focused man my money on my mind
Got a mil out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi and they ready to go

My flow my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib my cars my clothes my jewels
Look nigga I done came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga you mad I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that f\*cking cat trying to diss I'm trying to have fun

So come and get me a hug getting' this expeditiously
Girls they love me but hate all the niggas that's in the vicinity
Now I ride through the ghetto on chrome
My fans is calling me asking when I'mma come home

Now when my records selling ain't hard to tell
50 Cent Shade 45 you know how I play
I'm a P-I-M-P you don't wanna fuck with me
Got the haters mad want to see me B-I-G

I'm out on bail fresh outta jail California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing "Hoochies" screaming
Fiendin' for money and alcohol the life of a westside player
With cowards at it's own of f\*ckin' police player haters

Hey yo Thalía it's Joey Crack
Still got love for the Bronx we back
Yeah we was sittin' in the jail cell doing push-ups
Now she pushin' the yellow Ferrari pullin' up
The way you walk and the way you talk is so contagious
We both single put the break-up to the side and let's make up
They said we couldn't do it but we did it it's official

Just somethin' 'bout you


I want you yeah yeah yeah
I need you yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
I love you yeah yeah yeah
Thalía come on

I don't know if you can see the same things that I'm seein'
But when I look in the mirror it's like I'm not even there
So I'm pickin' hairs from my shoulder wishin' I could disappear
But since I'm here let me make it clear
Every time I hold the mic I'm a lethal weapon
If looks could kill my face would adorn your desk then
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have inks on my webbed toes
My finger tips to my eyelids I soak in hope
But right now my absolute is overflowing
So I'm 'about to soak in everything I've learned to cope with
Life's a bowl of punch go ahead and spike the bowl kid
You just may spill it on yourself actin' like "Oh what" like no bitch
It's okay try to get inside my cerebellum
Flow's like the melomel I get from Melle Mel's heritage
Hip-hops' holy grail rhythm's in my spirit
And I'ma shine brighter than the cast of Thundercats meowed combined with
It's like I'm Superman nigga can't nobody fuck with me
No matter how hard they try they just can't knock me out
I'm like a heavyweight champion knockin' 'em out one by one
Stick my hands in the pavement and put footprints on the ground
Nigga I'm like Superman can't nobody fuck with me
No matter how hard they try they just can't knock me out
I'm like a heavyweight champion knockin' 'em out one by one
Stick my hands in the pavement and put footprints on the ground


I don't know how you feel about this but I'm a little aggravated
A little frustrated maybe I need to be dedicated
And look back at how far I've come do a little bit of retrospection
At least if I can't do that I'll throw my shoe at the projection
'Cause everything is so blurry I can't see the sight
And if a nigga tries to sneak me then I just might
And even though my daddy left me but every time I looked up he was gone
I ain't gonna make no songs to apologize he's gone
See I'm tired of actin' like I'm sideways waitin' for some kindness
I'm 'bout to jump up in the pool of hip-hop's diamondness
And I'm gonna do it head-first losin' caution
I'ma step on every rapper's hand that's on the way up
Draw blood from a stone this life won't be a cake walk
So I'ma leap off the edge and see if I take off
I'm 'bout to catch a rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat
If I survive let 'em see me bloody from my hip hop's love of battle
It's like I'm Superman nigga can't nobody fuck with me
No matter how hard they try they just can't knock me out
I'm like a heavyweight champion knockin' 'em out one by one
Stick my hands in the pavement and put footprints on the ground
Nigga I'm like Superman can't nobody fuck with me
No matter how hard they try they just can't knock me out
I'm like a heavyweight champion knockin' 'em out one by one
Stick my hands in the pavement and put footprints on the ground


I'm the arch-nemesis of boredom
They call me the hip-hop savior
This life's a one-way street and I'm doin' it my way again
I'm like Superman nigga can't nobody fuck with me
No matter how hard they try they just can't knock me out
I'm like a heavyweight champion knockin' 'em out one by one
Stick my hands in the pavement and put footprints on the ground
Nigga I'm like Superman can't nobody fuck with me
No matter how hard they try they just can't knock me out
I'm like a heavyweight champion knockin' 'em out one by one
Stick my hands in the pavement and put footprints on the ground

Livin' my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you I'm lyin' next to her
I put your picture away sat down and cried today
I can't look at you I'm lyin' next to her


I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
And their half-hearted smiles tell me
Somethin' just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights
I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him


I saw ya yesterday with an old friend
Kid Rock: It was the same old same "how have ya been"
Sheryl Crow: Since you been gone my world's been dark and grey
Kid Rock: You reminded me of brighter days
Sheryl Crow: I hoped you were comin' home to stay
I was headed to church
Kid Rock: I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways


I just called to say "hello"
I couldn't get you on the phone
So I had to write this song
Just to let you know
That I'm thinkin' of you
And I wonder where you are tonight
I miss you
And don't want to fight


I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you I'm lyin' next to her
Verse 1:
So gone over you you you you
Can't get you outta my head
I'm so confused
You told me that you loved me
Said you'd never leave me
We were so tight
Thought we were happy
But you didn't tell the truth
And now you wanna play games
Mess with my mind
And leave me confused ooh

Chorus:
I'm so gone oh ooh
I'm so gone over you over you
I'm so gone oh ooh
I'm so gone over you over you

Verse 2:
You said you cared about me
But from your actions baby
I don't think you do
Been running 'round with her
Been lying 'bout it too
Don't know what to do
Can't let go of you
But I can't take the pain
I'm so confused
I wish that I could leave
But I don't wanna be a fool
And I keep holdin' on to you

Chorus:
I'm so gone oh ooh
I'm so gone over you over you
I'm so gone oh ooh
I'm so gone over you over you

Bridge:
But I don't wanna be here no more
Don't wanna be here no more
I don't wanna be here no more
Don't wanna be here no more

Chorus:
I'm so gone oh ooh
I'm so gone over you over you
I'm so gone oh ooh
I'm so gone over you over you

Outro:
I'm so gone so gone so gone
I'm so gone yeah yeah
Since I am an AI language model I do not generally provide uncensored lyrics that may contain explicit language or offensive content However as per your request here are the uncensored lyrics of "Why Don't You & I" by Santana featuring Alex Band:

Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
And it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever'
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say 'why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven'
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

When's this fever gonna break
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around

And it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever'
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say 'why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven'
Cause without you they're never gonna let me in

Slow slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No no chance
That I'm leaving here without you on me
I I know
Yeah I already know that there ain't no stopping
Your plans and those slow hands
Slow slow hands

So we should 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever'
Heads we will tails we'll try again
So I say 'why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven'
Because without you they're never gonna let me in

Why don't you and I get together
Why don't you and I get together
Why don't you and I get together
Why don't you and I get together

Met a girl thought she was grand
Fell in love found out firsthand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued


In a trap trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie


She f\*\*kin' hates me
Trust she f\*\*kin' hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away


She was queen for about an hour
After that s\*\*t got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt no feeling of bad no


In a trap trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie


She f\*\*kin' hates me
Trust she f\*\*kin' hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away


That's my story as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it's over and I'm glad
'Cause I'm a fool for all I've said


In a trap trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie


She f\*\*kin' hates me
Trust she f\*\*kin' hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away


She f\*\*kin' hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none
She f\*\*kin' hates me
I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Red Dirt Road" by Brooks & Dunn below:


I was raised off of rural route three
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road


It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned; I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road


Her daddy didn't like me much
In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road


It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned; I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road




I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh I got her back again
And drivin' home tonight
Feels like I found a long-lost friend


It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned; I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road


Oh I learned; I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road
Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the face of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find the sunlight
Gives their visions wings
Some find the moonlight
Brings them desires things

There are those who'll wait forever
For that something that never comes
But we'll keep on believing
That someday it's gonna run

'Cause anything is possible
When you believe when you believe
You're flying without wings

Some find it in the face of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

And you're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy you bring
I'm flying without wings
Absolutely Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Have You Forgotten" by Darryl Worley:

I hear people saying we don't need this war  
But I say there's some things worth fighting for  
What about our freedom and this piece of ground  
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down  
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in  
Before you start your preaching let me ask you this my friend  

Have you forgotten how it felt that day  
To see your homeland under fire  
And her people blown away  
Have you forgotten when those towers fell  
We had neighbors still inside  
Going through a living hell  
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden  
Have you forgotten  

They took all the footage off my TV  
Said it's too disturbing for you and me  
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say  
If it was up to me I'd show it every day  
Some say this country is just out looking for a fight  
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right  

Have you forgotten how it felt that day  
To see your homeland under fire  
And her people blown away  
Have you forgotten when those towers fell  
We had neighbors still inside  
Going through a living hell  
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden  
Have you forgotten  

I've been there with the soldiers  
Who've gone away to war  
And you can bet they remember  
Just what they're fighting for  

Have you forgotten all the people killed  
Yes some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field  
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon  
All the loved ones that we lost and those left to carry on  
Don't you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden  
Have you forgotten  

Have you forgotten  
Have you forgotten  
Have you forgotten

Verse 1:
I'm lookin in the mirror
At this woman down and out
She's internally dying
I know this wasn't meant to be
But it's happening now
Couldn't get away if I tried
I'm hearing these accusations
Tainted by rumors and lies
I can't take it but I'm trying

Chorus:
Rain on me
Lord won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live this way
Rain on me
Lord won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live this way
Rain on me

Verse 2:
I wake up every morning
Feelin like I can't face the day
Then I hear my babies cryin
Got to get them on their way
I wish I could make it easier
But life never promised me
Anything less than struggle and pain
So I'm taking this one day at a time

Chorus:
Rain on me
Lord won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live this way
Rain on me
Lord won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live this way
Rain on me

Bridge:
I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's joy behind that pain
And I'll be holding on for tomorrow
But right now I'm just living for today

Chorus:
Rain on me
Lord won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live this way
Rain on me
Lord won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live this way
Rain on me

Outro:
I don't wanna live this way
Rain on me

Verse 1:
I saw Star Wars at least 8 times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
I've seen the stuff they put inside
Stretch Armstrongs
I was Roger Staubach in my backyard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evil Knievel scars

Verse 2:
My first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut-off jeans man she looked so cute
Skatin' rink with Donna Starks
Double feature at the drive-in park
Burgers and fries Cherry Coke float
I was "Yippie yi yay old Roy ropes"
Hoppin' fences dodgin' sprinklers
We were swimmin' at the quarry nobody got drowned

Chorus:
We were 19 and 'em wheels were turnin'
Fast lane high plains never worried 'bout burnin'
Life's a highway sometimes it's a blur
But that don't mean it can't be sweet like sugar
1950's were the Norman Rockwell years
Workin' hard and just shiftin' gears
In 19 something if ya wanna know
Jukebox was in the corner and the café smelled like smoke

Verse 3:
I was listening to the Opry
When all of my friends were diggin' rock and roll and rap
I traded my bike for a microphone
I'm in the back of a pickup truck holdin' my own
I went to community college for a semester or two
Dropped out and got a job workin' steady like most people do
I ain't never been on no grand tour
I'm just a country boy who's comin' through the door

Chorus:
We were 19 and 'em wheels were turnin'
Fast lane high plains never worried 'bout burnin'
Life's a highway sometimes it's a blur
But that don't mean it can't be sweet like sugar
1950's were the Norman Rockwell years
Workin' hard and just shiftin' gears
In 19 something if ya wanna know
Jukebox was in the corner and the café smelled like smoke

Outro:
It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
Dad broke down and finally shaved
The moon was landing Mars was invaded
We got 'em all back home safe
And the greatest love we had was the love that we made
