There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help thinking
We could have had it all You're gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand You're gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again
Do you ever feel feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under scream but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Oh oh oh"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh oh oh"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down-own-own

Boom boom boom
Even brighter than the moon moon moon
It's always been inside of you you you
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Oh oh oh"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh oh oh"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down-own-own

Boom boom boom
Even brighter than the moon moon moon
Boom boom boom
Even brighter than the moon moon moon
Easy come easy go that's just how you live oh
Take take take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open why were they open

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 'cause

What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya yeah yeah
Throw my hand on a blade for ya yeah yeah
I'd jump in front of a train for ya yeah yeah

Mad women bad women that's just what you are yeah
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "S&M" by Rihanna:


Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is my pleasure
‘Cause nothing could measure


Love is great love is fine
Out the box out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more


'Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me


Na-na-na-na
Come on
Come on
Come on
I like it-like it
Come on
Come on
Come on
I like it-like it


Love is great love is fine
Out the box out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more


'Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me


Na-na-na-na-na
Come on
Na-na-na-na-na
Come on
Come on
Come on
I like it-like it
Come on
Come on
Come on

Love is great love is fine
Out the box out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting


'Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid
Yeah he found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden with a box of fun things and I don't even know what
But he's coming for you yeah he's coming for you

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run better run outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run better run faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say "Your hair's on fire you must have lost your wits yeah"

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run better run outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run better run faster than my bullet

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run better run outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run better run faster than my bullet

You'd better run better run faster than my bullet
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed oh well
It's a blacked-out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled

Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we’re gonna stop
Whoa-oh-oah
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed oh well

Oh her eyes her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are yeah

Her lips her lips
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know you know you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

She said "'Cause he made you perfect babe"
"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

Yellow model chick yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini yellow top missing

'Cause I'm killing every nigga that try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops I said on my dick
I ain't really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it I'm done


Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there homie
Let's go


'Cause I feel like I'm running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away get away get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win every day day go


See they don't really wanna pop me
Just know that you'll never stop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I got it going then I gotta get it then I gotta blow
And I gotta shudder any little thing that people be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter 'cause I'm gonna daunted
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do what I gotta do I can't be feeling like I'm falling behind
Running running behind 'cause I'm about to get left in the dust
So you can get on to the bus or you can run behind

Yellow model chick yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini yellow top missing
Yeah yeah that shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in 10 years in 2 days

I heard that you're settled down  
That you found a girl and you're married now   
I heard that your dreams came true  
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you  

Nevermind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said  
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"  

You know how the time flies  
Only yesterday was the time of our lives  
We were born and raised in a summer haze  
Bound by the surprise of our glory days  

Nothing compares no worries or cares  
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste  

Nevermind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said  
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"  

Nothing compares no worries or cares  
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste  

Nevermind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said  
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"  

Nevermind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said  
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"  

Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
I'll be lounging on the couch just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man
Oh yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all nothing at all
Tomorrow I'll wake up do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out:
This is great
Oh my god this is great
Yeah I might mess around get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops you'll just have to wait
Oh yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
No I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No no no no no no no no no no no no no oh
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all nothing at all
Nothing at all nothing at all
This kicked in got your tongue tied in knots I see
Spit it out 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level baby
If you want this good-ish

All right here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Show Goes On" by Lupe Fiasco:


Alright already the show goes on
All night till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on


Have you ever had the feeling that you was being had
Don't that sh*t that make you mad
They treat you like a slave with chains all on your soul
And put whips up on your back they be lying through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path I don't switch up I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glittering may not be gold don't let no body play me
If you are my homeboy you will never have to pay me
Go on and put your hands up when times are hard you stand up


Alright already the show goes on
All night till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on


One in the air for the people that ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the n*ggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teacher not scared
To tell those kids that's living in the ghetto
That the n*ggas holdin back that the World is theirs
Yeah yeah the World is yours I was once that little boy
Terrified of the World now I'm on a World tour
I will give up everything even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rapping 'round the World for


Alright already the show goes on
All night till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on


Alright already the show goes on
Alright till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
Just remember when you come up


The show goes on
Have you ever had the feeling that you was being held down
And everybody watching they ain't doing nothing but just looking
Well this is how I felt when Kell's couldn't keep his hands off my sh*t
I was steady trying to find the motive
Why do what I do ambition
It's like I'm sort of a soldier trying to stay sober
But still I'm a smoker I sip the Sprite
That's my soda I'm with the homie
Two braids in his hair chin-chilla colder
He colder than the polar bear
But I'm a polar bear so I can't afford to be polar
Won't leave the game til the fat lady sing a-a-a-h-h-h
It just so happen that that lady came round here
Singing that song God Bless America
But that just shows that we ain't never gon' change
The show goes on


Alright already the show goes on
All night till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight yeah baby
Tonight yeah baby
I got a reason that you should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's so wrong
Tonight yeah baby
Tonight yeah baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong tonight
It's hard to feel the rush to push the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge the edge the edge
The edge the edge the edge
I'm on the edge of glory and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
Another shot before we kiss the other side
Tonight yeah baby
Tonight yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight alright alright
Put on your shades cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight yeah baby
Tonight yeah baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight
All the way hands up you and me we're made of the same stuff

Put on your shades cause I'll be dancing in the flames

Verse 1:
It's been a really really messed up week
Seven days of torture seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime but it's time for me to quit her

Chorus:
La la la whatever la la la it doesn't matter
La la la oh well la la la
We're going at it tonight tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright alright tonight tonight
It's alright alright tonight tonight

Verse 2:
I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis

Chorus:
La la la whatever la la la it doesn't matter
La la la oh well la la la
We're going at it tonight tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright alright tonight tonight
It's alright alright tonight tonight

Bridge:
And we'll forget the danger we're in
Riding high above the whole scene
We're both so sick of waiting we're close to hesitating
Tonight tonight

Chorus:
La la la whatever la la la it doesn't matter
La la la oh well la la la
We're going at it tonight tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright alright tonight tonight
It's alright alright tonight tonight

Outro:
I'll get you right back to where you are
I'll get you right back to where you are
I'll get you right back to where you belong
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Lighters" by Bad Meets Evil featuring Bruno Mars:


This one's for you and me living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters a sky full of lighters


By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck or get struck like lightning
Fighters keep fighting put your lighters up point 'em skyward uh

Had a dream I was king I woke up still king
This rap game's nipples is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me till it kills me 
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or ever will be disagree Feel free but from now on
I'm refusing to ever give up only thing I ever gave up's using
No more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Popping shit on how you flipped your life around crock-of-shit
Who you dicks tryna fool Quit lying to your self bitch
Hope fucking with me's not the only thing you
Excelling at uhh



This one's for you and me living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters a sky full of lighters


Yeah
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight we're alright
So hold up your light
Let it shine
Cause this one's for you and me living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters a sky full of lighters


Now look at me and look at you
Now look at me again now look at you and me
Now imagine nothin' left to lose
But everything we're the proof You see
What do you say I'm
Oh panicking 
You say
Oh panicking



This one's for you and me living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters a sky full of lighters
If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Oh oh oh oh

Lord make me a rainbow I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors oh
And life ain't always what you think it ought to be no
Ain't even grey but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life oh well
I've had just enough time

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life oh well
I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life oh well

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Oh oh oh oh

The ballad of a dove oh oh
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears keep 'em in your pocket
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them oh

The sharp knife of a short life oh well
I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts oh no I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Oh oh
The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears keep 'em in your pocket
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them oh
So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I asked you to scratch my back could you manage that
Like it read well check it travel grab a back would
While I can handle that furthermore
I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to use my head voice singing like something off Thriller
But to head dance you're Rose forgets her
She said "maybe one day you'll be playing stadiums instead"
Of just a bar sayin' to me "please sing Asher"

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh Gym Class Heroes baby to sing along to my stereo
Let's go

If I was an old-school fifty-pound boombox remember them
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it sing along and take me by the hand
Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh Gym Class Heroes baby to sing along to my stereo
Let's go

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh Gym Class Heroes baby to sing along to my stereo

Verse 1: Lil Wayne
Six-foot seven-foot eight-foot bunch
Six-foot seven-foot eight-foot bunch

Verse 2: Lil Wayne
Excuse my charisma vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You don't wanna start Weezy 'cause the F is for finisher
So misunderstood but what's a world without enigma
Two bitches at the same time synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the circus and I am the clown
And she love it when I make her come down
B unnies eat your heart out Jeffrey Dahmer
I'll send them bloods at you like I'm sendin' out a charter

Verse 3: Cory Gunz
Man fuck these bitch-ass niggas I'ma spare everything but these niggas
I flip the gun they trippin' I'm trippin' but fuck it I'm codin' trippin'
I read between the lines of the eyes and your brows
Your silence is a sound
What is it You talkin' loud but you ain't sayin' shit
Cranberry vodka three olives I'm pissy huh
Flow make a cripple jump up and throw his crutches in
The crowd scatter applause nigga
Haha author of the authors my shit bang motherfuck the censors
Young Money too big we bangin' like a blimp
Motherfucker I'm ill not sick
And I'm okay but my watch sick
Yeah my drop sick yeah my glock sick
And my knot thick I'm it

Verse 4: Lil Wayne
Eight-foot blunt just killed my sumo
Shut the hell up and let my mojo groove
Got mo' dough than a ho And a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Now tell me what the fuck do you think hoe
I'm Wayne Rooney I go for the goal
I'm the referee And I blow the whistle
These niggas playing like they know something
And I got the Lex-watch-what-I-do-have
Insects up in my shit now I be the shit
And you're dead; diarrhea
Tea bags Time to put the Kettle on
Bitch I'm Ballin' like Stoudamire
Now who's colder
Damn I'm so sick I need a doc-tor
Hello hello hello Where da fuck is Samantha I'm a-mopped her

Outro: Lil Wayne
Uh pardon my talent
Uh Mister Cee Pitched on the Beat
Uh Vicious millimetre Lionz den
And you're mediocre bitch Like Celsius to Fahrenheit
Lying here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
Caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
We don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright oh let's do this right with just a kiss

I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine good times no I don't mind being with everyone else
But paradise is locked away when I'm with you
So after tonight I'm gonna find a way to make you mine
We don't need to rush this baby

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright oh let's do this right with just a kiss

No I don't want to say goodnight
I know it's time to leave but you'll be in my dreams
Tonight tonight tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
And I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright oh let's do this right
Baby baby

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
And I don't want to mess this thing up
No I don't want to push too far
I just want to be where you are
And I want to hold you tight
Treat you right be with you day and night
Baby all I need is just a kiss a kiss baby
All I need is just a kiss a kiss baby
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin' that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jumped the barbed wire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too

Better watch out for the boys in blue and all this
Small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is gettin' old
You better mind your business man watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin' man y'all ain't listenin'
Them ol' dirt roads is what y'all missin'

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin' that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good old days
The way we were raised in our southern ways
And we'd ride backroads to them all nighters
And Chevy would get stuck in the mud swampers
We fired up our tailgates spreadin' them chicken wings
Y'all it's a recipe this is how we do things

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin' that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Apologise if I say anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend
We could all have some fun believe me
And whats up with these new niggas
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours hate your bullshit hate these f***ng allegations
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking watch me take it


All I care about is money
And the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it
I'ma smoke until it's done
And I don't really give a f***
And my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older
Somebody shoulda told ya

Yeah f*** it I'm on one
Yeah I said I'm on one
F*** it I'm on one


I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognising the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills BOSS
Bend shawty on the sink BOSS
This is life at its highest point
My pride is never a point
My verse is a crime everytime I hear a 16
And verses keep murkin' tighter than a virgin
Pussy sweet sincent ass nigga like Persian
What's about now What's about then
Everywhere I go I gotta blurt with me and my mens


All I care about is money
And the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it
I'ma smoke until it's done
And I don't really give a f***
And my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older
Somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah f*** it I'm on one
Yeah I said I'm on one
F*** it I'm on one

All I care about is money
And the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it

And I don't really give a f***
And my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older
Somebody shoulda told ya

'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most


I learned to live half alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are


I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms


I learned to live half alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are


And it took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back


And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all
And who do you think you are
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are

All of the lights all of the lights
Turn up the lights in here baby
Extra bright I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here baby
You know what I need want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights


Fast cars shooting stars
All of the lights all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
All of the lights


If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
Something wrong I hold my head
M J gone our n**** dead
I slapped my girl she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home I'm almost there
I'm on my way headed up the stairs
To my surprise a n**** replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university
All of the lights cop lights flashlights spotlights
Strobe lights street lights
All of the lights all of the lights

Fast cars shooting stars
All of the lights all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
All of the lights


If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life


Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone our n**** dead
I slapped my girl she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone our n**** dead
I slapped my girl she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
As Sam Cooke would say "a change is gonna come"
I tell you that something's up
Or something's on the horizon
All of the lights
Verse 1:
Hey over there please forgive me
If I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song

Pre-Chorus:
So come here little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Say it clear little question
Wanna know just how you feel

Chorus:
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me

Verse 2:
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me

Pre-Chorus:
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me

Chorus:
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me

Bridge:
Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait I want it now na-na-now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out

Outro:
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now

Chorus:
Would you hold it against me
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
Here are the full uncensored lyrics of "More" by Usher:


Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
Yeah I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor
Know y'all been patiently waiting I can't take it no more
I'm about to give it up and like nobody else
And now I done been around all these other guys
But I ain't never met a man that could handle my body like
It's so crazy I wanna be wherever you are
Cause boy you got that uh you got that uh


You got that crazy love
Crazy love uh uh uh
You got that you got that crazy love
Crazy love uh uh uh

Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight

When we touch don't ever let me go


You got that uh you got that crazy love
Crazy love uh uh uh

You got that you got that crazy love
Crazy love uh uh uh

Crazy love crazy love


Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more more
You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy I like messing in your bed
Yeah I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed

All my life I've been good but now oh
I'm thinking 'what the hell'
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me if you hate me
You can't save me baby baby
All my life I've been good but now
Whoa what the hell

What what what
So what if I go out on a million dates
You never call or listen to me anyway
I rather rage than sit around and wait all day
Don't get me wrong I just need some time to play

You're on your knees begging please stay with me
But honestly I just need to be a little crazy
All my life I've been good but now oh
I'm thinking 'what the hell'
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me if you hate me
You can't save me baby baby

All my life I've been good but now
Whoa what the hell

La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la oh

La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la oh
Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I am on my way

Let's go yeah
You're listening now they say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song so many damn times
Five six seven eight times they're willing to rewind
These other cats aren't metaphorically wild man
I gave Streatham High my confidence boost
So now I'm flying like a superhero power of Zeus
'Swear catching my lightning they're just tryna bite in
'Cause I taste better they'll chew it and spit it out
I spit crack every verse in my crack house
And lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client I'm the player president
And I'm makin' moves so you can't afford to be missin'
Nah the '80s baby but now I'm 'bout to miss whole business

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I am on my way

It's like I'm sittin' in the clouds and nobody can't bring me down
I'm peepin' at the stars and my feet don't touch the ground
Touch the ground touch the ground 'cause everything I want I gotta have it now
Yellin' out money over everything money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened overnight
It's like we switched teams swore we was in the same routine
I keep lookin' at the sky 'cause it's gettin' me high
Forgettin' all the hurt inside you've been impressed by my brights
Ignited they sayin' I'm back I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off oh I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up well where'd I leave it at

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I am on my way

Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I am on my way

Turn the lights on

She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how how we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
She needs me now but I can't seem to find a time
I've got a new job now on the unemployment line
And we don't know how how we got into this mess
Is it God's test

Someone help us cause we're doing our best
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Sit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while a while yeah

We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting for the first time

She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
But we both know how how we're gonna make it work
When it hurts

When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we'll get through it yeah we'll get through it
And I know it's more than just survive
We'll get through it I know that it's the only way
We'll get through it oh oh for the first time
Oh for the first time
They're opening up the doors they're opening up the doors
Finally we're gonna walk finally we're gonna walk
Out of this maze
Yeah I'm not afraid of the dark I'm not afraid of the dark
But now it's time that the colours are gonna change time that the colours are gonna change
I've been waiting for this moment
All my life but it's not quite right
And this 'real' is a 'make-believe'

All these rules you gotta break
And all these fears you gotta face
It's real when you feel you can't erase
The feeling at the end of the day
All these changes they keep me guessing
Everyday I find out something new
I'm just trying to keep from getting jaded
Never knowing what to do
But hey for the first time
We're gonna start to wonder why

For the First Time
Girl I’ve been thinking ‘bout us

And you know I ain’t good at this stuff

These feelings pilin’ up won’t give me no rest

This might come out a little crazy

A little sideways yeah maybe

I don’t know how long it’ll take me but I’ll do my best

If you’ll be my soft and sweet

I’ll be your strong and steady

You’ll be my glass of wine

I’ll be your shot of whiskey

You’ll be my sunny day

I’ll be your shade tree

You’ll be my honeysuckle

I’ll be your honey bee

Yeah that came out a little country

But every word was right on the money

And I got you smilin’ honey right back at me

Now hold on ‘cause I ain’t done

There’s more where that came from

Well you know I’m just havin’ fun but seriously

If you’ll be my Louisiana

I’ll be your Mississippi

You’ll be my Little Loretta

I’ll be your Conway Twitty

You’ll be my sugar baby

I’ll be your sweet iced tea

You’ll be my honeysuckle

I’ll be your honey bee

Your kiss just said it all

I’m glad we had this talk

Nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms

I could’ve said “I love you”

Could’ve wrote you a line or two

Baby all I know to do is speak right from the heart

If you’ll be my soft and sweet

I’ll be your strong and steady

You’ll be my glass of wine

I’ll be your shot of whiskey

You’ll be my sunny day

And I’ll be your shade tree

You’ll be my honeysuckle

I’ll be your honey bee

You’ll be my Louisiana

I’ll be your Mississippi

You’ll be my Little Loretta

I’ll be your Conway Twitty

You’ll be my sugar baby

I’ll be your sweet iced tea

You’ll be my honeysuckle

I’ll be your honey bee

You’ll be my honeysuckle

I’ll be your honey bee

I really hate to let this moment go
Touching your skin and your hair falling slow
When a goodbye kiss feels like this


Don't you wanna stay here a little while
Don't you wanna hold each other tight
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight
Don't you wanna stay here a little while
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay


Let's take it slow I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love I wanna make love last
When you're up this high everything's just right
And I just wanna lay here by your side


Don't you wanna stay here a little while
Don't you wanna hold each other tight
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight
Don't you wanna stay here a little while
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay


Oh you wanna stay
It feels so right it can't be wrong
Don't you wanna stay


Don't you wanna stay here a little while
Don't you wanna hold each other tight
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight
Don't you wanna stay here a little while
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay


Don't you wanna stay
Don't you wanna stay
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we

I can't win I can't reign
I will never win this game without you
Without you without you
I am lost I am vain
I will never be the same without you

All I need is you and I without you
Without you without you


Oh oh oh You You You

Without You-ou-ou

Without you Without you


Can't erase so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we were strangled by your fate

But I don't want to take it slow
There's plenty of time for us to finally get it right don't wanna go
Without you without you


Oh oh oh You You You

I am lost I am vain

Oh oh oh You You You
Without You You
Without You-ou-ou
Without You You
You You You
Without you Without you
You think I'm pretty
Without any makeup on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down down

Before you met me
I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets just love
We can dance until we die
You and I we'll be young forever
You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets just love
We can dance until we die
You and I we'll be young forever
You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I might get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

Tonight tonight tonight

You make me
Feel like I'm living a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I might get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

Tonight tonight tonight
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Crazy Girl" by Eli Young Band:

Oh oh oh

Baby why you wanna cry
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We're gonna do what lovers do
We're gonna have a fight or two
But I ain't ever changin' my mind

Crazy girl
Don't you know that I love you
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman
Come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately
I love you like crazy girl

Wouldn't miss a single day
I'd probably just fade away
Without you I'd lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was livin' life all wrong
Smartest thing I ever did was make you all mine

Crazy girl
Don't you know that I love you
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman
Come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately
I love you like crazy girl

Like crazy
I love you like crazy girl

Oh oh oh

Some people say I'm crazy
But girl they don't understand
You're all I have to hold onto
I'm just an old fallen soldier
Trying to get home
Crazy girl
Don't you know that I love you
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman
Come here let me hold you
Have I told you lately
I love you like crazy girl

Like crazy
I love you like crazy girl

Oh oh oh
I love you like crazy girl
"Cheers Drink to That" by Rihanna:


Cheers to the freakin' weekend

Cheers to the freakin' weekend

It was a barefoot blue jean night
Dancin' in the moonlight
Everythang's alright
We got our hands up
Swingin' from side to side
We got our boots on
Kickin' up some dirt
The sky's full of lighters
A thousand little fires
And we're singin' oh oh oh oh

Yeah breathe deep
Smile big
Don't it make you wanna dance real slow
Don't it make you wanna drink a little more
Whip another dip around the floor
Yeah barefoot blue jean night

We were sittin' up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Talkin' 'bout girls and startin' up a plan
To get outta this one-horse town
And start a rock n' roll band
All we needed was a guitar
And a little bit of gasoline
We were gonna set fire to this town
And outta its ashes rise up from the sea

Yeah breathe deep
Smile big
Don't it make you wanna dance real slow
Don't it make you wanna drink a little more
Whip another dip around the floor
Yeah barefoot blue jean night

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town and big city bright lights
Girl the way you look in those jeans
Has me beggin' for your touch
Come on and set it right
We're gonna dance in the dirt all night

Yeah breathe deep
Smile big
Don't it make you wanna dance real slow
Don't it make you wanna drink a little more
Whip another dip around the floor
Yeah barefoot blue jean night

Breathe deep
Smile big
Don't it make you wanna dance real slow
Don't it make you wanna drink a little more
Whip another dip around the floor
Yeah barefoot blue jean night

Yeah come on
Mmm oh yeah
Alright
Verse 1:
Gonna put the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair

Chorus:
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Verse 2:
Wrote a note said "Be back in a minute"
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away
'Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair

Chorus:
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Bridge:
This Champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change you're geography
Maybe you might be
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair

Chorus:
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
repeat twice
Hey girl go on now
You know you've got everybody looking
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna Stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box it don't matter
Down on the tailgate girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' til the break of dawn
The DJ spinnin' that country song
C'mon watch you shake it for me
Girl shake it for me
Girl shake it for me
Girl shake it for me
Country girl shake it for me
Girl shake it for me
Girl shake it for me
Girl shake it for me

Let's go

The funk soul brother

Don't worry 'bout what the fuck is in my cup
Got a couple bottles but a couple ain't enough

All mine just don't talk let me
Get it get it get it


I wanna get with you ooooohhh
Only for one night
I wanna get with you ooooohhh
Yeah all right

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a f*ck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness


And they sayin' I'm back I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this sh*t I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off ooh I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up well where'd I leave it at

I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that


No don't do it please don't do it
Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know they know they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
Yeah they know yeah

That the real is on the rise
F*ck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide now it's something they know


They know they know they know
I be yellin' out "Money over everything money on my mind"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it they'll be over you
That new sh*t that you got is overdue
You better do what you're supposed to do
I'm like "Why I gotta be all that" but still I can't deny the fact
That it's true listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that


Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my sh*t and play it I ain't even gotta say it
They know they know they know


They know they know they know
I be yellin' out "Money over everything money on my mind"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it they'll be over you
That new sh*t that you got is overdue
You better do what you're supposed to do
I'm like "Why I gotta be all that" but still I can't deny the fact
That it's true listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body


Don't do it please don't do it
Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money so Drizzy gonna pay it

She ain't she ain't you no

Well I was raised underneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home ya know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
It's funny how it's the simple things in life that mean the most
Not where you live what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast to a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
I like to see the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Verse 1:
Cold bones yeah that's my love
She hides away like a ghost
Does she know that we bleed the same
Don't wanna cry but I break that way

Chorus:
Did she run away Did she run away I don't know
If she ran away if she ran away come back home
Just come home

Verse 2:
I got a fear oh in my blood
She was carried up into the clouds high above
If you're bled I'll bleed the same
If you're scared I'm on my way

Chorus:
Did she run away Did she run away I don't know
If she ran away if she ran away come back home
Just come home

Bridge:
I got a fear oh in my blood
She was carried up into the clouds high above

Outro/Chorus:
If you're bled I'll bleed the same
If you're scared I'm on my way
Did you run away Did you run away I don't need to know
If you ran away if you ran away come back home
Just come home
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that

You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that

You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that

If you be the cash
I'll be the rubber band
You be the match
I will be a fuse
Boom painter baby you
Could be the muse

I'm the reporter baby
You could be the news
Cause you're the cigarette
And I'm the smoker
We raise a bet cause you're the joker

Truth though
You are the chalk and I could be the blackboard
And you could be the talk and I could be the walk
Even when the room is dark I'mma glow
Riding up the richter scale I'mma weight
I'm worth every dollar and…
Okay here are the uncensored lyrics of "Price Tag" by Jessie J featuring BoB:


Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and
Smile

Why is everybody so serious
Acting so damn mysterious
You got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left yeah

Can you feel that yeah
We'll pay them with love tonight

And guess what in 30 seconds I'm leaving to Mars
Yes we leaving across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man you can't put a price on the life

So we aint gonna stumble and fall never
Waiting to see a sign of defeat uh uh
So we gonna keep everyone moving their feet

So bring back the beat uh and then everyone sing

Verse 1:
I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain't who I wanna be
But staying up all night
Lyin' on the floor
'Cause I'm broken
Isn't what I'm living for

Chorus:
The very thing that I need
Is the one thing I can't find
'Cause you're always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you when I'm away
And I'm missing you to death
And when you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

Verse 2:
I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain't who I wanna be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm goes through
And I need you

Chorus:
The very thing that I need
Is the one thing I can't find
'Cause you're always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you when I'm away
And I'm missing you to death
And when you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

Bridge:
I've never been this homesick before
Been keepin' my eyes on the door
And for the first time I don't wanna leave
Then somebody's sayin' hello
So I'll just say goodbye to sorrow
And I'm following you
'Cause you are the remedy

Chorus:
The very thing that I need
Is the one thing I can't find
'Cause you're always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you when I'm away
And I'm missing you to death
And when you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you I miss you

But here baby you know the deal
And she say "She wish she could find somebody more real

Then all the niggas that's tryna holla" but shit man
        

We were sittin' up there on your momma's roof
Talkin' 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh but you were so shy so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

"Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're 'bout to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not"

It was the best dang kiss that I'd ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand
So I took a chance

Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

"Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not"

Yeah baby I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not
Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Animal" by Neon Trees:

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Is this really how it goes
Say "Baby you're a mystery"
But you're really just a work of art
Do you got a filthy mind
I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know what you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know what you're feeling
I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know what you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know what you're feeling
Tell me what you want to be
Do you want to be a friend of mine
I'll give you candy give you diamonds give you pills
Give you anything you want hundred dollar bills

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "You and Tequila" by Kenny Chesney featuring Grace Potter:

Baby here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town

You and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me baby
One is one too many one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

You and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me baby
One is one too many one more is never enough

When it comes to you
Oh the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in

You and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me baby
One is one too many one more is never enough

You and Tequila make me crazy
You and Tequila make me crazy
You and Tequila make me make me crazy
She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the tail lights
Shining through the window pane
Chorus
He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
She said you're a ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You gotta gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
Verse 2
At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same 'ol light shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him
Chorus
He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
She said you're a ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You gotta gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
Born for leavin'
Verse 3
Well it's a winding road when you're in the lost and found
You're a lover I'm a runner and we go 'round 'n 'round
I love you but I leave you
I don't want you but I need you
You know it's you who calls me back here oh ooh
Chorus
I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change
I got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin' born for leavin'
And when I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whispering pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then

Welcome to the Danger Zone
Step Into The Fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They calling me an Alien
A Big-Headed Astronaut
Maybe it's because your boy Yeezy get Ass A lot


You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others futuristic lover
Different DNA they don't understand you


Man damn your lips very soft
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their needs
A summer disregard a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I know you're the one
So I offer you my one and only
Little In the middle but she got much back
Threats of violence I rescue her with a tick tick
A kiss just like poison
Like paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic


You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating leaves my body glowing
Say be afraid

Different DNA they don't understand you
Kiss me ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy you're an alien
Your touch so Foreign

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone

New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life good life

I say oh got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good good life

To my friends in New York I say hello
My friends in LA they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado

Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We are God of stories but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life good life

I say oh got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good good life

Hopelessly
I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly
I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly
I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly
The hope is we have so much to feel good about

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life a good life


I say oh got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good good life oh yeah

Oh yeah good good life
Good life good life
Watched the sun as it set in the sky
Mixed with the man and I looked in his eyes
Then the sound of a truck came and took him away
Off to the court in a formal suit and tie
He said "I'll be okay" and "Everything will be alright"
But I knew that was a lie
I was so scared but I had to follow
Cuz I didn't want to be left alone
And so I followed him in the courtroom
And I sat back and waited for the judgment
My knees got weak and my heart felt like lead
When the judge said "Let's proceed"
I cried and cried so much I couldn't breathe
When I woke up it was just a dream
Girl look at that body x3
I work out

When I walk in the spot this is what I see okay
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it show it show it

I'm sexy and I know it x2

When I'm at the mall security just can't fight 'em off
And when I'm at the beach I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
This is how I roll animal print pants outta control

And like Bruce Leroy I got the glow

Girl look at that body x3

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you're in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love


For a second you were here
Now you're over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love never had a love
Never had a love never had a love

When you was just a young'un your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder


For a second you were here
Now you're over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love never had a love
Never had a love never had a love


You had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking me out of my senses
We both tryna find a way to make the ends meet
Ended up at the same place at the same time
It's a coincidence ain't it
How we both in this situation
It's ironic ain't it
I know exactly how you feel
You know I been there for sure
Knockin' on the door telling you how I'm feeling about yours


For a second you were here
Now you're over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love never had a love
Never had a love never had a love


So she said "What's the problem baby"
"What's the problem I don't know"
"Well maybe I'm in love love"
"Think about it every time I think about it"
"Can't stop thinking 'bout it"

How much longer will it take to cure this
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love love
Makes me want to turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love


Come on come on oh turn a little faster
Come on come on oh the world will follow after
Come on come on oh everybody's after love
So I said I'm a sinner he said he's a sinner
Oh who's going to win We're both going to lose

You might be the one baby girl you might have potential
I ain't gonna rush it you can't be skeptical
You're worth it step up to the plate and get personal


Roll up uh

Shawty I roll up
I roll up uh
I roll up
Shawty I roll up


Oh I need you
La la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la
I'm so glad you specified your request for no labels additional commentary censorship or information Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Back to December" by Taylor Swift:

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it alright

I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If we loved again I swear I'd love you right

So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I'd go back to December all the time
Verse 1: Brad Paisley
We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you

Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then
I wanna feel that way again

Chorus: Brad Paisley & Carrie Underwood
Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me remind me
So on fire so in love Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me remind me

Verse 2: Carrie Underwood
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad 'cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night
Do you recall that sweater you had on
The one you got from the job you got that summer
When you went out with your friends that night
I shoulda been there in your arms instead of watching TV on that couch

Chorus: Brad Paisley & Carrie Underwood
Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me remind me
So on fire so in love Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me remind me

Verse 3: Brad Paisley & Carrie Underwood
Oh baby remind me yeah remind me
That's right remind me remind me who we were
When you remind me yeah baby remind me
Remind me who we were

Chorus: Brad Paisley & Carrie Underwood
Yeah we're so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me remind me
All those things that you used to do that made me fall in love with you
Remind me oh baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me oh baby remind me
Oh baby remind me remind me oh baby remind me

Outro: Brad Paisley & Carrie Underwood
Do you remember the way it felt
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
Remind me remind me
Sure below are the uncensored lyrics for "In the Dark" by Dev


On my waist through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes here you are
All alone dancing in the dark
Tell me baby if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want
Late at night I pretend we are
Dance dance dancing in the dark


Duet with Flo Rida
Let's go In the dark I see your smile
Stay awhile And your hands are holding mine
Just tonight Tonight togethеr in the dark
I can make you believе in love and sex and magic


Let me tell you now I'm talking in the dark
Feels like we're lost in eternity
Mmm it's alright I'm with you baby
So I'll just do it do it do it
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close


Duet with Flo Rida
Let's go In the dark I see your smile
Stay awhile And your hands are holding mine
Just tonight Tonight together in the dark
I can make you believe in love and sex and magic 


Everything's a mess when Jordin Sparks sings
But you're my DJ baby I'm your dancehall queen
And for tonight I'll be your fantasy
Your little good luck charm

Duet with Flo Rida
Let's go In the dark I see your smile
Stay awhile And your hands are holding mine
Just tonight Tonight together in the dark
I can make you believe in love and sex and magic 
Let's go In the dark I see your smile
Stay awhile And your hands are holding mine
Just tonight Tonight together in the dark
I can make you believe in love and sex and magic

So many girls in here where do I begin
I see this one I'm 'bout to go in
Then she said "I'm here with my friends"
She got me thinking and that's when I said


Where them girls at girls at
Where them girls at girls at
Where them girls at girls at
So go get them we can all be friends


Hey bring it on baby all your friends
You're the shit and I'm digging you reddish blend
Light it up for me and the friends
Where the hell is the waitress Bring me my damn drink


Kicks fresh looking like a bag of money
I'm Flo Rida I don't know if you know it
But I know I'm on my shit right now
Baby let me put you in your little love boat


Where them girls at girls at
Where them girls at girls at
Where them girls at girls at
So go get them we can all be friends


Hey bring it on baby all your friends
You're the shit and I'm digging you reddish blend
Light it up for me and the friends
Where the hell is the waitress Bring me my damn drink


Yo where my girls at Where my girls at
Let me see your hands up high we're burning up the sky
Here we go rock rock drop it low low
If you wanna party let me hear you yell "Hell yeah"


Where my girls at girls at
Where my girls at girls at
Where my girls at girls at
So go get them we can all be friends


Hey bring it on baby all your friends
You're the shit and I'm digging you reddish blend
Light it up for me and the friends
Where the hell is the waitress Bring me my damn drink


Where my girls at Where my girls at

Verse 1: Dr Dre
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life bring me back to life
Bring me back to life bring me back to life

Verse 2: Eminem
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in every day it's just so gray and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em they just say it's whack
But they don't know what dope is and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up breathed new life in me I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son demons fightin' you it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna hide or you're gonna go seek
But I'm sick of playing this game it's time to make room
And I'm calling you out on it not playing I'm saying I'ma come clean
And I need you to come back to me
And I'ma make you believe I I love love you

Chorus: Skylar Grey
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor to bring me back to life

Verse 3: Dr Dre
It hurts when I see you struggle you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled 'cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second-guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy Dre I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin' I need you come back for fuck's sake

Chorus: Skylar Grey
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor to bring me back to life

Outro: Dr Dre
And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back ]
Verse 1:
See you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Oooh oooh ooh
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too

Chorus:
Said if I was richer I'd still be with ya
Ha now ain't that some sh*t ain't that some sh*t
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you

Verse 2:
Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya trying to please ya
'Cause being in love with you
Assumed all the things that I would do
Hey hey

Chorus:
Said if I was richer I'd still be with ya
Ha now ain't that some sh*t ain't that some sh*t
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you

Bridge:
Now baby baby baby
Why you wanna wanna hurt me so bad
So bad so bad so bad
I tried to tell my mamma
But she told me "This is one for your dad"

Chorus:
Said if I was richer I'd still be with ya
Ha now ain't that some sh*t ain't that some sh*t
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you

Outro:
Now I know that I'm a fool
For being in love with you oh
And so I took a chance
And got slapped in the face waaoh
And I just want to forget you
I just want to forget you
I just want to forget you oh
Verse 1:
Wouldn't wanna be anybody else hey
You made me insecure Told me I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge When you're a diamond in the rough

But when it comes to me I wouldn't want to be anybody else
