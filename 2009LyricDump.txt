That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good good night x2

You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down


Hey
Hopped out of that house with my swagger
Hop in that with girl I got places to go
People to see time is precious
I look at my crowd and they out of control
Just like my mind where I'm going
No women no shorties no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now my Pirellis on rollin'
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on
Then pop in the night 'cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fade away shot
'Cause we ballin' it's Platinum Patron that be ours
Lil mamma I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you to drink with all that and power clubs


You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down
You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down


From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down


Hey
Shawty must know I'm not playin'
My money love her like a numba one fan
Don't look at my mouth let me do my thang
Let me see shawty low
Spin around that pole and get a little change
I pocket full of dollas
Girl ya spin my world around
Just the thought of you got my heart racin'
Let's take a risk 'cause you on my way
I hypnotized by the way
You shake that booty dont stop gyal
Boom boom yall

You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down
You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down


I got the house on the boat it's goin' down
When I spin back around
I'm headed for the night life that's for sure
This is my world
I'm the party starter in the house
Get a grip grip shots of Patron
And it's on girl
Oh believe me believe me
I got you tight
Holdin' onto me because we're moving right
Get your right hand up put it to the side
Put it to the side put it to the side
Boy I wanna see you try to move me move me

You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down
You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you’re so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I’m trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I’ll be giving it my bestest
And nothing’s gonna stop me but divine intervention

I reckon it’s again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won’t hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I’m yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you’re free
Look into your heart and you’ll find love love love love

Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We’re just one big family
And it’s our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So I won’t hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I’m sure
There’s no need to complicate our time is short
This is our fate I’m yours

Do you want to come on scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I’ve been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I’m saying is there ain’t no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It’s what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won’t hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I’m yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you’re free
Look into your heart and you’ll find that the sky is yours

So please don’t please don’t please don’t
There’s no need to complicate
‘Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate
I’m yours

Decided to dip but now you wanna trip

Don't pay him any attention  
Just cried my tears for three good years  
Ya can't be mad at me

If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

But I'm the only one that knows  
The real tea ooh ooh  

Their egos are big I don't give a shit  
And it goes like this oh  

  
Take a bow the night is over  
This masquerade is getting older  
Light are low the curtains down  
There's no one here there's no one here  

  
Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it  
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it  
Don't be mad once you see that she want it  
Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

End

In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh how could you be so heartless


How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You gotta do it I like that
Next time I see her gon' be like "Who dat"


I shouldn't have did that I know
But here we go again
Back on that bullshit knowin' we were more than friends
Listen and don't trip
I think I need somethin' to believe in
Breathe in breathe in breathe out
If it's love in the end gotta see it when I believe it
How could you be so heartless
Oh how could you be so heartless


Oh how could you be so dark
To put it all to shame
And I know I’m the one to blame
Ayy as I’m gettin' older things are just makin' sense
Feelin' like I'm missing pacer incomplete
Wonderin' who I am and tryna figure out who I'm gon' be
How could you be so yeah
Oh how could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo Yo yo yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
Ayo I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back you gon' show me
I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working

At a 9 to 5 pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence love
And where's that shiny car
And did it ever get you far
You never seemed so tense love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are

And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Where did it all go wrong
But the list goes on and on

Truth be told I miss you
Truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

And when you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
I found God on the corner of First and Amistad  
Where the west was all but won  
All alone smoking his last cigarette  
I said "Where've you been" He said "Ask anything"

Where were you  
When everything was falling apart  
All my days were spent by the telephone  
That never rang  
And all I needed was a call  
That never came  
To the corner of First and Amistad  

Lost and insecure you found me you found me  
Lying on the floor surrounded surrounded  
Why'd you have to wait Where were you Where were you  
Just a little late you found me you found me  

In the end  
Everyone ends up alone  
Losing her  
The only one who's ever known  
Who I am who I'm not and who I wanna be  
No way to know  
How long she will be next to me  

Lost and insecure you found me you found me  
Lying on the floor surrounded surrounded  
Why'd you have to wait Where were you Where were you  
Just a little late you found me you found me  

Early morning  
The city breaks  
I've been calling  
For years and years and years and years  
And you never left me no messages  
You never sent me no letters  
You got some kind of nerve  
Taking all I want  

Lost and insecure you found me you found me  
Lying on the floor where were you Where were you  
Lost and insecure you found me you found me  
Lying on the floor surrounded surrounded  
Why'd you have to wait Where were you Where were you  
Just a little late you found me you found me  

Why'd you have to wait to find me  
Why'd you have to wait to find me

I've been roaming around always looking down
at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody


Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you   off in the night when I'm losing my way
Someone to hold someone to care
Someone to love someone to hold


I've been wandering around always looking down at all I see
The painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody


Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you   off in the night when I'm losing my way
Someone to hold someone to care
Someone to love someone to hold


Someone to love
Someone to love


Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you   off in the night when I'm losing my way
Someone to hold someone to care
Someone to love someone to hold

And I say the same thing every single time

You the best I ever had best I ever had

I be yellin' "Good lord want your back that thang up
You the girl in my dreams when I'm not sleeping
And shorty you're a ten and that's without a question
Johnnie Walker wetting I'm tryna walk it out
And money talks when I'm talkin' 'bout the amount
Women listen and some choose to follow
And others lead I see that you gon' swallow
And I'll never leave you like a bad habit
And we'll have all the tools to combat it
I love your sushi roll hotter than wasabi
I race for your love shake and bake Ricky Bobby
I'm at your door on my Steve Harvey
And I can't let you go girl without a marry
And I say the same thing every single time
I say "You the f*ckin' best you the f*ckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had
Best I ever had best I ever had
I say you the f*ckin' best you the f*ckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had
Best I ever had best I ever had"
Guess this means you're sorry  
You're standin' at my door  
Guess this means you take back  
All you said before  
Like how much you wanted  
Anyone but me  
Said you'd never come back  
But here you are again  

'Cause we belong together now yeah  
Forever united here somehow yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly  
My life my life would suck would suck without you  

Maybe I was stupid  
For telling you goodbye  
Maybe I was wrong  
For tryin' to pick a fight  
I know that I've got issues  
But you're pretty messed up too  
Either way I found out  
I'm nothin' without you  

'Cause we belong together now yeah  
Forever united here somehow yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly  
My life my life would suck would suck without you  

Being with you

But I can't let you go  

Oh yeah

Forever united here somehow yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly

Remember those walls I built  
Well baby they're tumbling down  
And they didn't even put up a fight  
They didn't even make a sound  

I found a way to let you in  
But I never really had a doubt  
Standing in the light of your halo  
I got my angel now  

It's like I've been awakened  
Every rule I had you breakin'  
It's the risk that I'm taking  
I ain't never gonna shut you out  

Everywhere I'm looking now  
I'm surrounded by your embrace  
Baby I can see your halo  
You know you're my saving grace  

You're everything I need and more  
It's written all over your face  
Baby I can feel your halo  
Pray it won't fade away  

I can feel your halo halo halo  
I can see your halo halo halo  
I can feel your halo halo halo  
I can see your halo halo halo  

Hit me like a ray of sun  
Burning through my darkest night  
You're the only one that I want  
Think I'm addicted to your light  

I swore I'd never fall again  
But this don't even feel like falling  
Gravity can't forget  
To pull me back to the ground again  

Feels like I've been awakened  
Every rule I had you breakin'  
The risk that I'm taking  
I'm never gonna shut you out  

Everywhere I'm looking now  
I'm surrounded by your embrace  
Baby I can see your halo  
You know you're my saving grace

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes Yeah
You PMS like a bitch
I would know Uh-huh
And you overthink always speak
Cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me


'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up


You don't really wanna stay no
You don't really wanna go
Oh you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down


You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up


Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride


You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up


You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know that
You're not gonna change
My eyes are open wide
By the way I made it through the day
I watch the world outside
By the way I'm leaving out today

I just saw Halley's comet she waved
Said 'Why are you always running in place'

Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize this is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice
So listen close it's only for today

I just saw Halley's comet she waved
Said 'Why are you always running in place'

Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize this is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Here is my chance
This is my chance

Tell my mother tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize this is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Verse 1:
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat gotta be first

Bridge:
I'm like the ringleader I call the shots Call the shots
I'm like a firecracker I make it hot

Chorus:
When I put on a show I feel the adrenaline moving
And I'm-a let go of everything that's been holding me back
I'm-a show the world how to dance Kitty kitty
The boys the girls they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies bats her cartoon eyes Kitty kitty

Verse 2:
Play with the rhythm baby don't stop
Pour a little sugar on me honey don't stop
I'm sweet enough already baby don't stop
Pour a little sugar on me baby

Bridge:
I'm like the ringleader I call the shots Call the shots
I'm like a firecracker I make it hot

Chorus:
When I put on a show I feel the adrenaline moving
And I'm-a let go of everything that's been holding me back
I'm-a show the world how to dance Kitty kitty
The boys the girls they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies bats her cartoon eyes Kitty kitty

Outro:
They're all watching me like they're watching TV
I'm-a Cinderella they wanna be like me
Day and night
I toss and turn I keep stressing my mind mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play play

Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone some things will never change never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner Mr Solo Dolo
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he see's the life he made made

The pain is deep
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through through

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone some things will never change never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

Slow mo'
When the temple slows up and creates that new new
He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining man he's super cool cool

The lonely nights
They fade away he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone some things will never change never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night

The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess whoa
Am I gonna fit in

Jumped in the cab
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
I got my hands up they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah it's a party in the USA
Yeah it's a party in the USA

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks
She's gotta be from out of town"

So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
I got my hands up they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah it's a party in the USA
Yeah it's a party in the USA

Feel like hoppin' on a flight on a flight
Back to my hometown tonight town tonight
Something stops me every time every time
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

So I put my hands up they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
I got my hands up they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah it's a party in the USA
Yeah it's a party in the USA
Black dress with the tights underneath
I got the breath of a last cigarette on my teeth
And she's an actress actress but she ain't got no need
She's got money from her parents in a trust fund back east

Tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth
Tell your boyfriend if he says he's got beef
That I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him

She wants to touch me whoa
She wants to love me whoa
She'll never leave me whoa whoa oh oh
Don't trust a ho never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me

XOXO breathe me in breathe me out
So amazing insignificant
Stamina baby I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust you know

She wants to touch me whoa
She wants to love me whoa
She'll never leave me whoa whoa oh oh
Don't trust a ho never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me

Don't trust a ho never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho 'cause the ho won't trust me
Feel it comin' in the air
And the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to thrillin' that's right
All night I tribe with that girl
Hop inside the wave ah yeah
Don't you ask me why
I'm just a thug life up in this oh yes
This star studded night
All y'all see just Rihanna
Pursuing laws a hundred moves a day
Don't mess with my Kool-Aid oh no
These jokers gettin' too bold
These fools gettin' too cold
I ain't laughin' it's nada
Ain't that something
My enemies preyin' on me
Blockin' my path to glory
But the Green Goblin ain't ready
I'm ready whole squad want no problems
We gon' do it till it hurt
Gone crush this town
Heard all screams tonight
It's just the beginning
This police chick can't stand me
But they worry 'bout me
Well as long as they ain't stoppin' me
Got the whole block wishin' they could run with me
But these fools too slow
And weak-minded they can't keep up with me
Head in the clouds they too bricked up
Takes a great idea to get an idea
They can't vibe with the Basquiat
Give me back my crown oh yeah
Me and my clique trainin' for Combat
Ready for the day we gon' clock in
I see these random dudes gettin' nervous
Now the day has come they get to see who's boss
Boy look who runnin' now running now
We gonna run this town tonight
Yeah I said it we run this town tonight
Track-star of my life tonight
Yeah I said it we run this town tonight

I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie live a lie live a lie


And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine
Because when I arrive
I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is
Forgot
I must now remind you
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock


Now the son's disguised as the uprising
Expecting first prize
It's time to rewind
haha
Ayye
And let it rock


I'm back like I forgot somethin'
I'm somethin'
Rollin' Rock rubbin' rap runnin'
Miles like I'm tryna get a flat stomach
Like Wayne a personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll bang your perp' up
This flow is Flav-O-Rama
Miss forgive my manners
I'm Poppin' Shoppin' Brandon
And I'll be nasty when you pass me like "aggh"
And Baby I'll be bad E-E-Electrifyin'
I'm Lyin' Down on my stomach
Volcano Poppin' off
And I'm Vibe Flyin'
Ridin' on the Earthquakin' Ground
Movin' like a vibrator gone tryna eat her 
Oh It was her who picked the hit a-nusha 
On this verse is Mine it's how I'm livin' now


And let it rock
And let it rock
And let it rock

I'm back like I forgot somethin'
I'm somethin'
Rollin' Rock rubbin' rap runnin'
I'm let it rock rock rock rock rock rock rock
I'm back like I forgot somethin'
I'm somethin'
Rollin' Rock rubbin' rap runnin' Let it rock
I'm let it rock rock rock rock rock rock rock

I got my chips cashed in my chips
Bought myself a fancy pair of shoes
Big ole house on the hill
I quit my job I told my boss to shove it
All cause I was tired of being used


There's a moment in time
And it's stuck in my mind
Way back when we were just kids
Cause your eyes told the tale
Of an act of betrayal
I knew that somebody did


Oh waves of regret waves of joy
I reached out to the one I tried to destroy
You you said you'd wait
'Til the end of the world


I imagine your smile
And the feeling of your touch ooohh
And I remember the way you smelled
Down the hall I was drunk again
And it was just like you were
Here again just like you've been
Never gone never far


And I'm sure I haven't met you yet
But I remember oh I remember


You you said you'd wait
'Til the end of the world

To show never gone never far
Oh come on say that you'll wait

You you said you'd wait
'Til the end of the world
Waves of regret waves of joy
To show and to be


What you want what you need
I got a little piece of you
Insatiable you just can't get enough
Ain't no reason you know I ain't lyin'
This is not about emotion you can't buy my devotion


You you said you'd wait
'Til the end of the world
Waves of regret waves of joy
To show and to be shown
To prove me right to prove me wrong
Waves of regret waves of joy
To hold my hand to take me on
Waves of regret waves of joy
To show me love to hold me tight
Waves of regret waves of joy
I'm sober now for three whole months
It's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart
Is the one thing I won't touch again
In my sober eyes I've got nothing to hide
Nothin' to prove and I'm not hiding mine
We'll be united and I'll take on the world
Waves of regret waves of joy
Oh ohhh ohhhh
You you said you'd wait
I know you you said you'd wait
Waves of regret waves of joy
Superstar

Gotta clue what you're doing

Verse 1:
Who's that knocking on my door 
It's gotta be a quarter past four 
I'm looking at the clock it's almost time to start 
Hope she's ready I don't need no indecisive heart 

Verse 2:
Can't survive on what a heart needs 
It needs more than a mattress and some sheets 
If it ain't real love then it's just time wasted 
I'm looking for the real thing not just some good relations 

Chorus:
Cause I'm mad girl you got me mad 
You got me wasting all my time time 
Cause I'm mad girl you got me mad 
You got me counting to nine ten eleven 11

Don't wanna pretend everything's alright

You got me wasting all my time time 
Cause I'm mad girl you got me mad 
You got me counting to nine ten eleven 11

It ain't working girl you're making me go backwards 
I spent too much time just to work with this 
I'm done I'm finished gotta cease and desist 

Chorus:
Cause I'm mad girl you got me mad 
You got me wasting all my time time 
Cause I'm mad girl you got me mad 
You got me counting to nine ten eleven 11

Verse 1:
We're driving slow through the snow on fifth avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left it's so overdue
It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here

Pre-chorus:
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts yeah

Chorus:
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger slipping through our fingers
I don't want to try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part I hate this part

Verse 2:
I can't take these nights
Knowin' that I'll miss ya
Here's where I wanna be

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts yeah

Chorus:

All we do is linger slipping through our fingers
I don't want to try now
All that's left's goodbye to

Bridge:
I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
Cause I see sunset in your eyes

Chorus:
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger slipping through our fingers
I don't want to try now
All that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part I hate this part

Outro:
All I know is I can’t bear the thought of you not in my life
I gotta find a way find a way
I gotta find a way find a way
I gotta find a way find a way
I gotta find a way find a way
This time I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough

So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen

So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that

'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight out on the street out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right
It's just like deja vu
Me standing here with you

So I'll be holding my breath
Could this be the end
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that

'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

You can't give up When you're looking for
A diamond in the rough You gotta rough it up
When you're looking for love

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me
Ohhh
Nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

I don't know if I can yell any louder
How many times I've kicked you outta here

Or said something insulting
I can be so mean when I wanna be
I am capable of really anything

I can cut you into pieces
But my heart won't let me do it

And if I shed a tear
I won't cage it 
I won't fear love
And if I feel a rage
I won't deny it
I won't fear love

Ahhh

I know I'm headstrong 
And all 
We're friends 
You're gone
And I just beat off
All night long

I know we're headstrong

And we're- nothin' more

Oh no no

Please don't leave me

Please don't leave me 
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please don't leave me

How did I become so obnoxious
What is it with you that makes me act like this
I've never been this nasty

Can't you tell that this is all just a contest
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest
But baby I don't mean it
I mean it I promise

Please

Please don't leave me

Oh please don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please don't leave me

I forgot to say out loud how beautiful you really are to me
I cannot be without

You're my perfect little punching bag
And I need you 
I'm sorry

Da da da da da da da
Da da-da da-da da

One word turns into a war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down
My world's nothing when you're gone

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing
Oh no these times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield a battlefield a battlefield

Ooh there's somethin' about
Kinda woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's nothin' sexier to me than a female


Who's in dependent but she knows how to shine
And she don't have to worry 'bout mine


She's got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time


I know you got your own thing

And I'm not sure if this is alrightAm I just a fragment of you
Am I just a fragment of you
'Cause I can't make you wholeI've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like youCan't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of youEvery step that I take is another mistake to you
And every second I waste is more than I can takeI've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like youI've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like youI've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to beI've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

My best effort to provide the uncensored lyrics of "If Today Was Your Last Day" by Nickelback:

My best friend gave me the best advice  
He said "Each day's a gift and not a given right"  
Leave no stone unturned leave your fears behind  
And try to take the path less traveled by  
That first step you take is the longest stride  

If today was your last day  
And tomorrow was too late  
Could you say goodbye to yesterday  
Would you live each moment like your last  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have  
If today was your last day  

Against the grain should be a way of life  
What's worth the price is always worth the fight  
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try  
So live like you're never living twice  
Don't take the free ride in your own life  

If today was your last day  
And tomorrow was too late  
Could you say goodbye to yesterday  
Would you live each moment like your last  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have  
Would you call those friends you never see  
Reminisce old memories  
Would you forgive your enemies  
Would you find that one you're dreaming of  
Swear up and down to God above  
That you finally fall in love if today was your last day  

If today was your last day  
Regardless of who you are  
So do whatever it takes  
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life  

Let nothin' stand in your way  
Cause the hands of time are never on your side  
If today was your last day  
And tomorrow was too late  
Could you say goodbye to yesterday  
Would you live each moment like your last  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have  
And would you call those friends you never see  
Reminisce old memories  
Would you forgive your enemies  
And would you find that one you're dreaming of  
Swear up and down to God above  
That you finally fall in love if today was your last day
Verse 1: Fabolous
I'm in my
Throwback snapback
I'm cooler than a Fan-Tas
LI stand up
We're cooler than a Fan-Tas
My neck chilly my wrist on freeze
My pockets stuck on overload my rain never ease
I'll be flying and stylish every time I leave
You trying to be like me but haters never succeed
All black when I ride I'm like a brand new hearse
I be smoking purple diesel; boy get off that dirt
You boys ain't making no noise
Y'all dudes is like the rodents
You so NYC you need to go and buy some Pro-Keds
My flow is like dope I cook it cut it and dry it
I'd make a million by June
I'm still walking with my tie-dye

Chorus: The-Dream
Girl I'm about to have a fit
You're the one who make me sick
I'm just playing let's have a ball
All we need is some privacy
Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Watch the money go It's kind of funny
Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Verse 2: Fabolous
I'm co-owner bitches wanna Zone us
It's only been a year and I've already blown up
I'm the one to blame now everybody want to claim
My old time aim just minus the grain
I keep 'em barren my trunk is the aquarium
George Foreman grillin' y'all niggas is aquarium
Here go my Louie I mix it with Henny
I'm fittin' to have your main bitch mix it with penny
I'm on the top floor number's on the big board
My pockets on a diet but my money's getting bigger
Had Brett Favre money but he didn't retire
Throw it in the bag hope this nigga is a buyer

Chorus: The-Dream
Girl I'm about to have a fit
You're the one who make me sick
I'm just playing let's have a ball
All we need is some privacy
Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Watch the money go It's kind of funny
Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag

Bridge: The-Dream
We gon' get it right
We gon' get it right baby
You are the one and only whoa
So let's make it do what it do

Chorus: The-Dream
Girl I'm about to have a fit
You're the one who make me sick
I'm just playing let's have a ball
All we need is some privacy
Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag
Watch the money go It's kind of funny
Throw it in the bag
Throw it in the bag

Verse 1:
Top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit and run
And I still taste it on my tongue

The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh so bad it hurt
But girl in case you haven't heard

Chorus:

Outro:
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh baby baby have you seen Amy tonight
Is she in the bathroom is she smokin' up outside
Oh oh baby baby does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'mma buy her do you know just what she likes

Oh oh tell me have you seen her
Because I'm so-o-oh I can't get her outta my brain
I just want to go to the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home

Ha ha he he he ha ha ho
Love me hate me say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are beggin' to If You Seek Amy

Love me hate me but can't you see what I see
All of the boys and all of the girls are beggin' to If You Seek Amy

Oh oh baby baby whatcha gonna do
When you know that she's gone and you're left alone by the phone
D-d-do you call her at home

Oh oh tell me baby what's gonna happen to us
When we go down like thunder it's gonna wake up everyone
Oh oh baby baby we're gonna be in love

Ha ha he he he ha ha ho
Love me hate me say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are beggin' to If You Seek Amy

Oh seek Amy oh seek Amy

Love me hate me but can't you see what I see 
All of the boys and all of the girls are beggin' to If You Seek Amy
She had a shiny little Beemer with the rag top down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barking and wagging around
And I just laughed and said y'all get in

She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do baby I don't care
We can go to the show we can stay out here and just chill

Driving down a dirt road laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window an ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights it's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin' that's right I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbed wire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls

King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue and all this small town he said she said

Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
You better mind your business man watch your mouth

Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking yeah y'all ain't listening
Them ol' dirt roads is what y'all missin'

Driving down a dirt road laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window an ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights it's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin' that's right I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good old days
The way we were raised in our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it

I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood back in them woods
We do it different 'round here that's right
But that's the way we do it and we like it

Driving down a dirt road laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window an ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights it's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin' that's right I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Say you're sorry
That face of an angel comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known I should have known
That I'm not a princess this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
Baby I was naíve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love you had to fight to get the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know
I'm not a princess this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm sooo sorry
'Cause I'm not your princess this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Then" by Brad Paisley:

I remember trying not to stare the night that I first met you  
You had me mesmerized  
And three weeks later in the front porch light  
Taking forty-five minutes to kiss goodnight  

I hadn’t told you yet but I thought I loved you then  
And now you’re my whole life  
And now you’re my whole world  
I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl  

Like a river meets the sea  
Stronger than it’s ever been  
We’ve come so far since that day  
And I thought I loved you then  

I remember taking you back to right where I first met you  
You were so surprised  
There were people around but I didn’t care  
I got down on one knee right there and once again  

I thought I loved you then  
And now you’re my whole life  
And now you’re my whole world  
I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl  

Like a river meets the sea  
Stronger than it’s ever been  
We’ve come so far since that day  
And I thought I loved you then  

And I could just see you  
With a baby on the way  
And I could just see you  
When your hair is turning gray  
What I can’t see is how I’m ever gonna love you more  
But I’ve said that before  

And now you’re my whole life  
Now you’re my whole world  
I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl  

We’ll look back someday  
At this moment that we’re in  
And I’ll look at you and say  
And I thought I loved you then  
And I thought I loved you then
Oh what the hell she said
I just can't win for losing
And she lays back down
Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doing
Like I don't know now
By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night
Can make you blind
I can just imagine
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be
And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
She sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
But it don't feel right
By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
And don't let her see
And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
She shuts out the night
Tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be alright
She'll be alright
Just not tonight
And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
Ooh
Down
Oh down
And her diamonds falling down
Verse 1:
Three is a charm two is not the same
I don't see the harm so are you game
Let's make a team make 'em say my name
Lovin' the extreme now are you game

Pre-chorus:
Don't you blame it on me when you're you're the one that's causing it all
Don't you blame it on me when you're you're the one that's causing it all

Chorus:
I'm a slave for you I cannot hold it; I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you; I won't deny it; I'm not trying to hide it
Baby don't you wanna dance up on me I just wanna dance next to you
To another time and place I just wanna dance next to you

Verse 2:
Overprotected I need to be told

Don't you blame it on me when you're you're the one that's causing it all
Don't you blame it on me when you're you're the one that's causing it all

Baby don't you wanna dance up on me I just wanna dance next to you
To another time and place I just wanna dance next to you

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this sh*t forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
I'm shuttin' sh*t down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this sh*t forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne


I'm the young money millionaire tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write sh*t 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds minutes hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-ch-ch-choppa
Sister brother son daughter father motherf*cker
Copper got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin' telekinesis
P-p-p-p-probably stickin' to the G-code
But I'm 'bout to break the rules
I'm the illest motherf*cker alive watch me prove it I'll prove it


I'm livin' in that 21st century doin' something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power
Twenty-four seven never gon' give in
I'm the type of n*gga that'll check the check
Do the math I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those that really know me know that I'm not a star
And this sh*t is not a hobby
My whole clique's 'bout business
And that business is makin' hits
I'm never satisfied can't knock my hustle
I'll be the last one to wake up early
And the first one to go to sleep
They said I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day goddamnit I'm killin' this sh*t
I know damn well y'all feelin' this sh*t


B*tch I'm Mack Maine flyin' over Maine
Swift as a crane stronger than Taim
Sorry for the wait I've been runnin' late
But Young Money gon' be okay
‘Cause I’m the blonde bomber hotter than summer sun
Finna let a n*gga know ain't no mother motha*f*cka like me biatch
Okay all black Gucci shades top back
Ridin' on a horse ha cowboy on his Bo Derek
I'm that yes sir
I'm at the bank I'm on my Lisa Simpson sh*t
I'm at the bank I'm on my Lisa Simpson sh*t
Everybody tune in this is Carter 4 traffic
In the Garden seats got my bees in the attic


I ain't got no money I ain't got no card to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we could be the perfect soulmates
Talkin' 'bout forever b*tch I got it tatted on me
P*ssy cats is screamin' "Where's the Hope" b*tch lookin' for a tit to lean on
I've been climbin' up the totem pole haven't stopped to breathe for a second
Thinkin' of that criticism to level on the DJ who's revvin' up the engine
And I'm gettin' honked at I'm ready to jump any second
Me and my conscience have a talk and I'm just tryna take 'em
On a road that doesn't revel on tellin' an exposé
I'm hopin' that they don't close the curtains on me before I can close the door
On them I'm lookin' in the mirror I'm tryna see me clearer
I'm tryna see this picture clearer a third eye never in a blinder
I could never take the lead I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'll never be irrelevant to society
That's what it is to be the illest never quenchin' my thirst
Until the fillin' spillin' over onto the verge of hysteria
Momma said "Never say never" the verve the thrill is never gone
Uh the thrill is never gone
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Me plus you I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you one time I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you one time I'ma tell you one time
One time one time

When I met you girl my heart went knock knock knock

Verse 1:
I run from hate 
I run from prejudice 
I run from pessimists 
But I run too late 
I run my life 
Or is it running me 
Run from my past 
I run too fast 

Chorus:
Or too slow it seems 
When lies become the truth 
That's when I run to you 

Verse 2:
This world keeps spinning faster 
Into a new disaster 
So I run to you 

I run to you babe 
And when it all starts coming undone 
Baby you're the only one I run to 
I run to you 

Verse 3:
We run on fumes 
Your life and mine 
Like the sands of time 
Slippin' right on through 
And our love's the only truth 
That's why I run to you 

Chorus:
This world keeps spinning faster 
Into a new disaster 
So I run to you 
I run to you baby 
And when it all starts coming undone 
Baby you're the only one I run to 
I run to you 

Bridge:
Oh oh I run to you 
This world keeps spinning faster 
Into a new disaster 
So I run to you 
I run to you babe 
And when it all starts coming undone 
Baby you're the only one I run to 
I run to you 

Outro:
Whoa oh I run to you 
I run to you girl 
Whoa oh I run to you
Oh sweetheart put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure you've found it

Slow motion sparks you've caught that chill
Now don't deny it but boys will be boys oh yes they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh no I do not hook up up I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no I do not hook up up I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I can't cook no but I can clean
Up the mess she left lay your head down and feel the beat
As I kiss your forehead this may not last but this is now
So love the one you're with you wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail

A quick fix won't ever get you well
Oh no I do not hook up up I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no I do not hook up up I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight
To say

'Cause I feel
The distance between us could be over with a snap of your wrist
Oh no I do not hook up up I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no I do not hook up up I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight
Oh sweetheart put the bottle down

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now


We gettin' close close to the hour
I've been crushin' on you baby for a minute
Readin' every one of your messages how could I not wanna bone
I've been feeling under pressure baby but thanks for being my comfort
Your body as a temple love to which I wanna confess
And it deserves communion so I asked if I could partake
And of course you indulged said "Baby don't you be late"


Give me the green light give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now I'm ready to go right now
We can go all night give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now I'm ready to go right now


Your kiss tastes like summer your hand in mine
Feels like a breeze baby go slow take your time
Holdin' onto the moment I'm caught in your headlights
And I know it's only one night but I'm about to go blind


Give me the green light give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now I'm ready to go right now
We can go all night give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now I'm ready to go right now


Happy holidays all of us
That's the time I always fall in love
This time I'm not alone I got a partner my nigga
She don't flinch at much
My new thing said "fuck it's cold"
But she like how I warm her up
I'm draped up like a king she's a queen started mean
It's a movie no edit no cut
She got a a nigga nose wide open and suspectin' that it's true
Right now I'm in love like a kid and what I'd do to be next to her
I tell her "I love you let's cuddle up with some muscle up too"


Give me the green light give me just one night
One night one night is all I need

We can go all night give me the green light

Well he said "I've been watchin' you dad ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are"
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah we're just alike hey ain't we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watchin' you

We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said "Lord please help me help my stupid self"
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turnin' on my Scooby-Doo nightlight
I tucked myself in and my prayers were said
I knew that heaven was in my dad's hands

I've been watchin' you dad ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixin' things and holding mama's hand
Yeah we're just alike hey ain't we dad
I want to do everything you do
So I've been watchin' you

With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said "My little bear is growin' up"
He said "But when I'm big I'll still know what to do"

'Cause I've been watchin' you dad ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
Then I'll be as strong as Superman
We'll be just alike hey won't we dad
When I can do everything you do
'Cause I've been watchin' you
She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And her lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out: "I love you"

You got a way of making me feel so fine
You keep me rockin' in the sunshine
And swimmin' in the sea of your silky skin
And you're the girl of my dreams
And I'd like to thank you for waiting patiently
Daddy's little girl what you've grown into is unbelievable

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out: "I love you"


She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out: "I love you"

She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out: "I love you"

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
It's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out: "I love you"

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would have worked out right yeah
We were never meant for do or die


I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you now
I can't stop


I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone


Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you want to cry
Started with a perfect kiss
Then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go


I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone


I'm already gone already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone already gone
There's no moving on so I'm already gone


I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
Verse 1: Michael Franti
This one goes out to you and yours worldwide
I say “Hey I’ll be gone today
But I’ll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
But I know one thing that I love you baby girl
I love you I love you I love you

Chorus: Michael Franti & Cherine Anderson
I say “Hey I’ll be gone today

I love you I love you I love you

Verse 2: Michael Franti
Now dance like a dervish baby thanks
To the things you do and the way you move
All night I take shakes
And I’m like damn it's gonna be a long night
But when the light hits your eyes it’s a fine sight
And I’m feeling alright my heart starts to drumming
You’re two-step and my brain starts humming
Humming humming humming

Chorus: Michael Franti & Cherine Anderson
I say “Hey I’ll be gone today
But I’ll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
But I know one thing that I love you baby girl
I love you I love you I love you

Bridge: Cherine Anderson
What if what if we all stopped believing in war
In guns in violence in hate in death
What if we all just prayed for love
For peace and for life and more life
'Cause you know what Nothing we can buy
Is more important than being alive
So like love yourself and love your life

Chorus: Michael Franti & Cherine Anderson
I say “Hey I’ll be gone today
But I’ll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see the less I know
But I know one thing that I love you baby girl
I love you I love you I love you

Younger now than we were before

We were both young when I first saw you  
I close my eyes and the flashback starts  
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air  
See the lights see the party the ball gowns  
See you make your way through the crowd  
And say "Hello"
  
Little did I know
  
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles  
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"  
And I was crying on the staircase  
Begging you "Please don't go " and I said
  
"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting all that's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say "Yes'"
  
So I sneak out to the garden to see you  
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew  
So close your eyes  
Escape this town for a little while
Oh oh
  
'Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter  
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"  
But you were everything to me  
I was begging you "Please don't go" and I said
  
"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting all that's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say "Yes"  
Romeo save me they're tryna tell me how to feel  
This love is difficult but it's real  
Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess  
It's a love story baby just say "Yes'"  
Oh oh
  
I got tired of waiting  
Wondering if you were ever coming around  
My faith in you was fading  
When I met you on the outskirts of town  
And I said
  
"Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone  
I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head I don't know what to think"  
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
  
And said
"Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone  
I love you and that's all I really know  
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress  
It's a love story baby just say 'Yes'"  
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
  
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
You're on the phone with your girlfriend she's upset  
She's going off about something that you said  
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do  
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night  
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like  
And she'll never know your story like I do  

But she wears short skirts I wear T-shirts  
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find  
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time  

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  
You belong with me  

Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans  
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be  
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself  
Hey isn't this easy  

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town  
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down  
You say you're fine I know you better than that  
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that  

She wears high heels I wear sneakers  
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers  
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find  
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time  

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  

Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know baby  
You belong with me you belong with me  

Oh I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night  
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're about to cry  
And I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams  
Think I know where you belong think I know it's with me  

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you  
Been here all along so why can't you see  
You belong with me  

Standing by and waiting at your back door  
All this time how could you not know baby  
You belong with me you belong with me  

Have you ever thought just maybe  
You belong with me  
You belong with me

Ohh I've been traveling on this road too long too long
Just trying to find my way back home back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone
And ohh

Verse 1: TI
Ever had one of them days you wish woulda' stayed home
Run into a group of niggas getting they hate on
You walk by they get wrong you reply then shit get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion
Just you against them pick one then rush 'em
Figure you get jumped here they come to get you
Duct-taped your torso hand cuffs and ankles
Then they take this shit way outta' proportion
Way past discussion your life is lost
And this wasn't even your own fight whatever
Bentley coupe's gon' and you tatted 4 in 'em
Roof gone' let the top back and then stock come in
Lamu doors on her let em' ft Knox send in
My niggas is home they be out in a few
The same ones that's gon' rode with me when I had a price on my head


Ohh I've been traveling on this road too long too long
Just trying to find my way back home back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone
Ohh

Ever had one of them days u wish woulda' stayed home

Verse 2: TI
I see the state champs sitting on chrome
They leave the pretty chick alone becasue they couldn't get her phone
They mad and disrespectful fuck nigga's
Your whole style and approach is hurtful
Aye and your man said that apart of the game
If that's the case motherfucker we playing the same
I'm getting money go head envy me
I'm happy that hatin' is what you pretend to be
Mad at the fact that I'm getting cash
'Real' niggas just conseal what they really feel
'Cause the skull will be out of them
K-A ain't gotta part of them
Gone


Ohh I've been traveling on this road too long too long
Just trying to find my way back home back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone
Ohh

Bridge: Justin Timberlake
Ever had one of them days u wish woulda' stayed home

Verse 3: TI
Hey let me kick it to you right quick man
Not on some gangsta shit man on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way big Phil
But this fast money thing it ain't what I'm about
It's the cars the hoes the clothes and the house
This money shit been figured out
But they ain't no price tag when you doubt
As I travel down this lonely road
Feel like I'm walking with a blind fold
Hope I ain't got to many miles to go
Payin' homage to the God that's far beyond
Flooded with stones and I'm from the home
Where the young niggas' prone to end up locked in the dome
It's where the word is the word and your purpose is known
But sometimes you get sidetracked on the loss of your own


Ohh I've been traveling on this road too long too long
Just trying to find my way back home back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone
Ohh

Verse 1: Keri Hilson
Not again
Oh this ain't supposed to happen to me
Keep rockin' and keep knockin'
Whether you Louis Vuitton it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're servin' on a platter
So what we gon' have dessert or disaster
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race
But I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
As hard as I did yeah
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life our house and kids yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down knocked me down
Verse 2: Keri Hilson
Sometimes love comes around Love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down Knocks you down

Verse 3: Kanye West
I never thought I'd fall in love with her
Not only that I fell for the fuckin' industry's tricks
Skate on until the whole thing blurs
Can't explain what happened Earthquake dog Yeah
But you got me sorta like "Oh okay yeah" Aye
Man I'm so wrapped up in my wifey
Thoughts of Black love leave my mind fuckin' icy
And I'm down in Miami
Love can be stronger than pride homie
Reason why I say that I'm tryna get my way back
She's still the love of my life and I'mma be the fight of her life
We're always gonna fight for love we're always gonna fight for love
And we always gon' fight for love even though we at odds
Sometimes love comes around Love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down Knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around Love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down Knocks you down
Verse 4: Ne-Yo
Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
To that constellation you and me
Switching positions we're so Kamasutra
But we're always in trouble we're both stubborn
Yeah I know we've had some bad luck
But we're still gonna fight like we're sharin' last bucks
You've got my back down here on Earth
So when it's all over and when it's all done
We can look back and we can always remember
We made these promises  Promises
To each other Each other
And we have to keep them Keep them

The order from the way that thing drop
Got me a fantasy

Da da da another reason to keep girl up outta that door

To me she's worth the catch
And if it means giving up the dough

Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grinding that pole

"I was like why are you so obsessed with me

Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional you're delusional boy you're losing your mind

Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seein' right through you like you're bathin' in Windex

Sayin' I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaine's

My body is craving so feed the hungry
I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday
And Friday to Friday not getting enough retribution or decent incentives
To keep me at it starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office ahh
So I'm gonna go somewhere closer
To get me a lover and tell you about it
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe
Sitting across the bar staring right at her prey
It's going well so far she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student
To locate the single man I've got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divas or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe
SOS she's in disguise
SOS she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out coming out coming out
SOS she's in disguise
SOS she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out coming out coming out
Verse 1: Lil Wayne
I like a long haired thick red bone
Open up her legs then filet mignon that pussy
I'ma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in I'ma own that pussy
I be the babymakin ahol' up
Before you leave I'ma need my H-Town lover
I be bangin that thing like we Lovers
She be bangin that back like a mothafuckin drummer
She got a n*gga at home
And one on the side
Best friend is a dyke
They afraid that when I'm in it I'll divide
Tear that pussy up and I'ma get right back
And when I'm finished I'ma bring my n*gga right back

Chorus: Lil Wayne
Every girl want me to be their man

But I ain't got time for a girlfriend

Verse 2: Drake
Uh Drizzy Drake the ladies love me
Started from the bottom now we're here nigga we made it
Yeah shoutout to them girls that replaced me
And bounced back so quick like it's a "L" race
I'm in the building but I'm tryna take the penthouse
And I'm tryna get on stage and fuck with Trey Songz
She just wanna be with a star
Got her ass backstage and then it started
I'm flyin private through Cloud 9
Them stewardesses is getting so excited
Got a special request let's go and party
And when the plane lands tell her meet me at the Marriott
Damn I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us

Chorus: Lil Wayne
Every girl want me to be their man
Every girl wanna tie me down
Every girl loves me for who I am
But I ain't got time for a girlfriend

Verse 3: Jae Millz

While the haters just hoping that I slip trip fall stumble

Young Money eatin all you haters do is add salt
Stop the hatin you could catch up if you just crawl
Don't compare me to n*ggas that's barely here
Ihout to all my bitches middle finger to all my peers
Y-M motherfucker I'm iller than the sickest no I'm the Sargeant
Nothin but filth when I talk I'm Ester Dean in the booth

I make her feel like a virgin all over again

Every girl want me to be their man
Every girl wanna tie me down

Verse 4: Gudda Gudda
More money more problems that's true
But with the money that I have I have no problems with you
Just left the strip club threw approx fifty
And I'm feeling like the man call me Mr Curtis Jackson
I got money on my mind big dreams small wishes
Come through hit you up with the cannon like nick and your ass gettin towed up like switches
Better pay attention follow my lead
They tell me life is a bitch and that bitch is a disease
I'm just tryin to pay attention and get my cheese
Cause dos is always sweeter than uno baby please

Chorus: Lil Wayne
Every girl want me to be their man
Every girl wanna tie me down
Every girl loves me for who I am
But I ain't got time for a girlfriend

If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air
That party last night was awfully crazy

Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed

After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex with a lot of women who got stories to tell
I hope they ain't lyin'
Now here we go again we're sick of these
Living like life's a party
But this is only temporary
Guess I'm just young but I'm still comin' out strong
And here's to tonight and while we're at it here's to the morning
And here's to college
This is college huh

Stewardess says "Sir fasten your seatbelt please"
Fifty thousand feet and then we elevate

And now you're gone like you don't remember then
But I bet you're sleeping real good tonight my friend

How do you how do you
How do you how do you sleep
How do you how do you

I can try my best to provide you with the requested lyrics but please note that the song itself does not contain any explicit or offensive language Here are the uncensored lyrics to "The Climb" by Miley Cyrus:

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming but
There's a voice inside my head saying
You'll never reach it
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels
Lost with no direction
My faith is shaking
But I I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down but
No I'm not breaking
I may not know it but
These are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most yeah
Just gotta keep going
And I I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on
'Cause there's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
Yeah yeah-ee-yeah
Keep on moving keep climbing
Keep the faith baby
It's all about it's all about the climb
Keep the faith keep your faith whoa
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home to come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted granted
And everything you had got destroyed

Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Girl it's time to turn off the lights
We'll take a ride into the night
Drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Just me and you
Nothing to lose
Just me and you
Nothing to prove

Lose control
Lose control

Right now
Na na na
Right now
Na na na

If we go together we go far
Don't look back we just left the bar
Take my hand girl come with me
This is where we're meant to be
Just me and you
Nothing to lose
Just me and you
Nothing to prove

Lose control
Lose control

Right now
Na na na
Right now
Na na na

We can find a place where we can be alone
Where no one else can find us
You know we can just take our time
Don't need nobody to rush us

Lose control
Lose control

Right now
Na na na
Right now
Na na na

Right now
Na na na
Right now
Na na na
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread thread thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems when I fall asleep

Leave my door open just a crack
Please take me away from here
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Please take me away from here
Why do I tire of counting sheep
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar jar jar jar
Verse 1: Mario
I love you but I don't think I can love you anymore
When I kiss you so good why would you wanna break up
When this loving is so good why would you wanna break up
When I hit that I'ma switch your position
When I hit that I'ma slow it down baby
We both know that love is what you make it
And I would never ever fight to fake it
I ain't ever been a type to rate to date you
I just wanna give you love pleasure and happiness
Take you to the club buy you drinks of Cristal's
I can see it in your eyes that you're feeling the same

Chorus: Mario Sean Garrett
I love you but I don't think I can love you anymore oh
When I kiss you so good why would you wanna break up
When this loving is so good why would you wanna break up oh
When I hit that I'ma switch your position
When I hit that I'ma slow it down baby
You ain't never ever gotta worry about me
I promise to provide everything you need
Anything you want I will give it to you babe
Hey hey hey hey hey
You're all I ever wanted
Hey hey hey hey hey
If we do it then we both know the truth
Hey hey hey hey hey
If I'm your man I'ma take care of you

Certainly Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Crack a Bottle" by Eminem Dr Dre and 50 Cent:


Oh Ladies and gentlemen the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner weighing 175 pounds with a record of 17 rapes 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady 


So crack a bottle let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh uh-oh bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers Who's got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk 


OK let's go back with Andre the Giant
Mister elephant tusk fix your muss
You'll be just another one bit the dust
Kiss my butt lick frumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the reconstruction of Snoop Doggy
This game is like my drug I sell it to the fiend
My only concern is making green
Grab hold of my balls like that's right they're in my grasp
Control how I'm movin' slowly lift 'em up 


So crack a bottle let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh uh-oh bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers Who's got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk 


Ladies and gentlemen Dr Dre
They see that low rider go by they like "Oh my"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that six-trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch they're sick of me
But hey what else can I say I love LA
'Cause over and above all it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again 


So crack a bottle let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh uh-oh bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers Who's got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk 


Now I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it could all be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah pondering'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders
Yo guns will make you a scholar
Bullets'll make you famous
This lifestyle's rough this much I know
When shit gets hard I'm just like "Fuck it yo"
Snap back to reality look it's B Rabbit
Don't act like you don't know the name
I'm the motherfuckin' reason why these rappers change
Claimin' they're writers they just gettin' smoked like salmon
And everything's ridin' on the outcome of this battle
I'm gonna say what I want to say and I'm gonna do what I want to do
And guess what I don't apologize for shit
I like to party so crack a bottle let your body waddle 


Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh uh-oh bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers Who's got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk 


Bottle a bottle na-na-na a bottle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Verse 1:
There's no streetlights on these roads 
So I can't see where we're going 
But in our hearts we'll find the road 
That we've been so desperate to know 

Chorus:
So goodbye to you 
Goodbye to everything we knew 
All the memories filled with regret 
I wish that I could forget 
So goodbye to you 
Goodbye to everything we knew 
You were the one I loved 
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

But now I'm just an empty shell 
Tried so hard to keep you to myself 
But the more I held on the more I fell 
And now it's time to say farewell

Goodbye to everything we knew 
All the memories filled with regret

But I'll make it through 
I'll find a way to start anew 
I'll learn to say goodbye to you

21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One last chance
To make it right
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn’t pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
