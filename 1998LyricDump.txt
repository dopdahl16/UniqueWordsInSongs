When I first saw you I saw love
And the first time you touched me I felt love
And after all this time you're still the one I love

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

They said "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong

You're still the one
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'

They said "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong

You're still the one
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

You're still the one
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
I'll do my best to provide the uncensored lyrics of "Truly Madly Deeply" by Savage Garden:

I'll be your dream I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope I'll be your love be everything that you need
I love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do
I will be strong I will be faithful 'cause I'm counting on
A new beginning a reason for living a deeper meaning yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish send it to heaven then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of
The highest power in lonely hours the tears devour you

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Oh can you see it baby
You don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come

I'll be your dream I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope I'll be your love be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea

Until the sky falls down on me
Verse 1:
How do I get through one night without you
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be
Oh and I
I need you in my arms need you to hold
You're my world my heart my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life

Chorus:
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive

Verse 2:
How do I how do I oh how do I live
Without you
There'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything real in my life

Chorus:
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive

Bridge:
How would I ever ever survive
How would I oh how would I

And tell me now
How do I live without you

If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive

Outro:
How do I how do I oh how do I live
How do I live without you baby
How do I oh how do I breathe
How do I breathe without you baby
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I oh how do I live
Everywhere I go every smile I see
I know you are there smiling back at me
Dancing in moonlight I know you are free
Cause I can see your star shining down on me

Together again it would feel so good to be
In your arms where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise; if it's one that you can keep
I vow to come for you if you wait for me

Say sweet little things that I long to hear
Like "Hey baby love the way you look tonight"
And with your hand in mine we will walk and talk
Along the sand on a clear moonlit night

Just like we used to do when love was new
and Just like a dream come true that's how it was
and babe Just like we seemed so good together we could face anything
I know things will be better if you stay with me
Good to note that the "Candle in the Wind 1997" and "Something About the Way You Look Tonight" songs were released as a double A-side single but here are the uncensored lyrics for each song 

"Candle in the Wind 1997":

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart

You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid

Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

"Something About the Way You Look Tonight":

There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell you
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain
But there's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But there's something about the way you look tonight

Takes my breath away

The way you look tonight
With a smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty
I'm speechless and I don't know where to start

And I can't explain
But there's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But there's something about the way you look tonight

Takes my breath away

And I never know
That part of me that you bring out
You make me feel like I could be someone
And I like it

And I can't explain
But there's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But there's something about the way you look tonight

Takes my breath away

The way you look tonight

So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye

She had two babies one was six months one was three
In the war of '44

Every telephone ring
Every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh would her son grow to know his father

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry

He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm

The years pass by and now he has granddaughters
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry

You look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
So breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father and his father did
I want to be here now
So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the love in every eye
She said it's cold
It feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
And I seen the sun up ahead
At the county line bridge
Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothin' left
She hit the end-it's just her window ledge
Hey now what's this
I see
I thought this was supposed to be
The supposed to be
Where is the applause
And the parades and the soul-grabbing claws
Oh hey now what's this
I thought we were
Supposed to live the life
Fantastic
And dress like the queen
Or a king or whatever
So impressive
And convincing
And we're all dressed up
In the emperor's clothes
But it wasn't quite the style
Oh we go crashing down
We come back every time
We descend from the clouds
And we never know why
Verse 1:
You'll never hear her say
"I gotta go I had a late night out with my friends"
Sometimes she'll complain "You work too much"
But she understands
And knows she's got to let him do what he can
Sometimes she'll forget the little things
Like what dinner would be
But she knows how to end disagreements
When they occur

Chorus:
No no no
You don't love me and I know now
No no no
You don't love me so let me go now

Verse 2:
I can't be wasting my time
I don't have the will
I'm packing up my bags
And giving you until
I'll be outta here by nine
You can keep your little wife
She'll never figure out the one thing she's missing
But I'll be long gone and missing

Chorus:
No no no
You don't love me and I know now
No no no
You don't love me so let me go now

Bridge:
No more late night phone calls
Don't forget it boy
Don't want your complimens
Just respect I'm leaving
No more late night phone calls no more no more no more
Don't forget it boy don't forget it
Don't want your complimens don't want your compliments
Just respect I'm leaving

Chorus:
No no no
You don't love me and I know now
No no no
You don't love me so let me go now

Outro:
You don't love me and I know now you don't love me you don't love me
No no no no more no more no more
You don't love me so let me go now you don't love me you don't love me
Every night in my dreams

I see you I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near far wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on

Near far wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this
I did it my way

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics of "The First Night" by Monica:


It was like
It was like
Whoa whoa
Uh uh oh
For the first time
It felt like I was such a big deal
You walking me to my car at night
I knew I was gonna be all right
The first time I felt love
It was like
Little though did I know
That you would rock my world
And change it forever


The first night
I laid eyes on you
I knew
That you were the one
The one that I had been searching for
So beautiful
The way you touched me in places
That I never known could feel so good
The first night I knew it was real


It was like
It was like
Whoa
It was like
It was like
Whoa whoa
It took me a minute
But I finally realized
That you were the end of my rainbow
My pot of gold
And all of those nights
That I prayed you'd come my way
I knew you were worth waiting for


The first night
I laid eyes on you
I knew
That you were the one
The one that I had been searching for
So beautiful
The way you touched me in places
That I never known could feel so good
The first night I knew it was real


From the way you smiled at me
Ooh ooh
I knew that we were meant to be
Ooh ooh
In your eyes I saw the light
Ooh ooh
That I've been waiting for all my life


The first night
I laid eyes on you
I knew
That you were the one
The one that I had been searching for
So beautiful
The way you touched me in places
That I never known could feel so good
The first night I knew it was real


It was like
It was like
Whoa whoa uh uh oh
For the first time
It felt like

Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the those PHD niggas
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though
See it's a difference a lot of niggas pop shit

But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas me BI Puff Lox whoever

I'm the epitome of this quagmire

Ridiculous so exquisite
Rubber grip tight split the William Bonnie shit
Can't leave the game alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me DA wanna box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the Izzo M to the Izzo

Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters girls on shoulders

Bruise too much I lose too much
Step on stage the girls boo too much

Too much Me lose my touch never that
If I did ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at

Wave them side to side and keep their hands high
While I give your girl the eye player please
Lyrically niggas see BIG be flossin' jig on the cover of Fortune
Five double oh get the phone number
Your name in the streets is more like a con man
Thug's fantasy real life Willie Wonka

Adia I do believe I failed you

Adia I know I've let you down

Don't you know I've tried so hard

To love you in my way

It's easy let it go

Adia I'm empty since you left me

I try to find a way to carry on

I search myself and everyone

To see where we went wrong

There's no one left to finger

There's no one here to blame

There's nothing left to prove

But everything to gain

Adia I thought that we could make it

But I know I can't change the way you feel

I leave you with your misery

A friend who won't betray

I pull you from your tower

I take away your pain

And show you all the beauty

You possess if you'd only let yourself believe

That we are born innocent

Believe me Adia

We are still innocent

It's easy we all falter

But does it matter
Yes here are the uncensored lyrics for "Crush" by Jennifer Paige:

Ah crush ah
See you blowin' me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's goin' on baby

If you see somethin' in my eye
Let's not overanalyze
Don't go too deep with it baby

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do I'll play loose
Not like we have a date with destiny it's just a little crush crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing crush
Not like everything I do depends on you shoo-ooh-ooh

Sha-la-la-la sha-la-la-la
It's raisin' my adrenaline
You're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it baby

You say the word "forevermore"
That's not what I'm lookin' for
All I can commit to is "maybe"

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do I'll play loose
Not like we have a date with destiny it's just a little crush crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing crush

Hanging 'round downtown by myself
And I had so much time
To sit and think about myself
And then there she was
Like double cherry pie
Yeah there she was
Like disco superfly

I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair
Who's that casting devious stares
In my direction

Mama this surely is a dream
Yeah mama this surely is a dream
Yeah mama this surely is a dream
Dig it

Moved into a brand new apartment
In a city wouldn't you know
The rent was cheap and the view was so nice
I thought "Lo and behold once again I'm right"
I'm in this lovely place
With the girls upstairs
But they never shut up
So I can't sleep at night

I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair
Who's that casting devious stares
In my direction

Mama this surely is a dream
Yeah mama this surely is a dream
Yeah mama this surely is a dream
Dig it

Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I had so much time
To sit and think about myself
And then there she was
Like double cherry pie
Yeah there she was
Like disco superfly

I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair
Who's that casting devious stares
In my direction

Mama this surely is a dream
Yeah mama this surely is a dream
Yeah mama this surely is a dream
Yeah mama this surely is a dream
Yeah mama this must be my dream
Verse 1:
Always been told that I've got too much pride
Too independent to have you by my side
Then my heart said all of you will see
Just won't live for someone until he lives for me

Chorus:
Don't wanna be somebody's something to do
Just to be seen and then be through
With you with you with you with you
Don't wanna be somebody's something to do
Just to be seen and then be through
With you with you with you with you

Verse 2:
If it's love that you want then you'll have to wait
Cause I've been running in circles all day
Well I know that you're just a young boy
But I'd like to think you'd understand

Chorus:
Don't wanna be somebody's something to do 
Just to be seen and then be through 
With you with you with you with you 
Don't wanna be somebody's something to do 
Just to be seen and then be through 
With you with you with you with you

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be

When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key

If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key

If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key

If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key

If I could melt your heart frozen
We'd never be apart frozen
Give yourself to me frozen
You hold the key frozen

You're frozen
You're frozen
When your heart's not open
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Gone till November" by Wyclef Jean:

[I wanna dedicate this song to everyone who say
Wyclef won't make it and to all the people that
lamented the tragedy of this city that New York City]

I dedicate this to my dad who never been there
To my mom who always cared
This is my story yeah yeah yeah yeah
I smoke my spliff at the park
'Cause that's my block yeah that's my hood
But it's all good and I'm still here
Therefore I'm still alive therefore I'm still breathing
Four years later but we still grieving
For the Towers that got knocked down and for the families that lost someone
I feel your pain no one on Earth can get used to it
But let's not let our anger turn into hate
'Cause that's got to stop somewhere along the way
So we gotta pray yeah we gotta pray pray
And we gotta stay yeah we gotta stay stay
United divided we fall
Planes hit the tower that's what we saw
Four years gone till November
Then they get it and they'll be gone forever
And we gotta stay yeah we gotta stay stay
United divided we fall fall
And we gotta stay yeah we gotta stay stay
United divided we fall fall
So I dedicate this to my people that understood
What I'm talking about when I say it's all good
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "My Body" by LSG:

Slide instead of being a major threat
Here comes Puff playin' in the next man's jet

But that's all right 'cause this is what we breed
And with this I guarantee you must concede
And feel the funk that we bring to this beat Uh-huh

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "When the Lights Go Out" by Five:


Yo everybody get on the floor
Let's dance
Don't fight the feeling
Give yourself a chance


Shake shake shake shake
When the lights go out
Shake it shake it
Shake it all around



We're gonna take it to the limit
Time to take it into overdrive
Got the headlights shining
Into my eyes
We're gonna move in closer
I know you want me to hold you
I'm looking right beside you
And your heart's a-pumping


Shake shake shake shake
When the lights go out
Shake it shake it
Shake it all around



Don't say you're leaving me
Cause you know I need you desperately
You say you wanna stay
But you gotta make it right
We're gonna be rockin' on till the broad daylight


Shake shake shake shake
When the lights go out
Shake it shake it
Shake it all around



Baby when the lights go out
Every single word can not express the love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe I swear you will succumb to me so baby come to me
When the lights go out


Shake shake shake shake
When the lights go out
Shake it shake it
Shake it all around



Baby when the lights go out
Verse 1:
Walkin' on the beach hand in hand
Wishin' that it would never end
Just lettin' time fly by with you
Feelin' like I found my heart's home
But one day soon we will be alone
Our sacred paradise will be broken in two
But right now we're just too happy to care
Nothin' can stop what we have we'll always be there

Chorus:
They don't know about you
They don't know about me
They don't know about us
Our love our struggle our fight our history
They don't know about trust
They don't know about pain
They don't know about us
Our sweat our blood our tears our name

Verse 2:
Every day we learn something new
Discovering the depths of me and you
And our understanding grows stronger every time
But the world will make it hard for us
They'll try to destroy our love and our trust
They won't believe we are meant to be divine
But we'll stand tall and fight for what we know
We won't let anyone break our sacred love's flow

Chorus:
They don't know about you
They don't know about me
They don't know about us
Our love our struggle our fight our history
They don't know about trust
They don't know about pain
They don't know about us
Our sweat our blood our tears our name

Bridge:
And if the world should ever try to tear us apart
We'll hold onto our love deep in our hearts
And we will face whatever comes with strength
Our love's forever it's infinite length

Chorus:
They don't know about you
They don't know about me
They don't know about us
Our love our struggle our fight our history
They don't know about trust
They don't know about pain
They don't know about us
Our sweat our blood our tears our name

Fiend is a name who refused to fall
I'm a tyrus in my own time I'm a solider in this game
And taking shots to the brain just to get some change
I crawl before I walk I ball before I talk
And I did that there on my own now it's on
I'm a motherfuckin' fool and I'm off that Glengin
22 inch Felons when I'm rollin' through the bricks and
I'm known to crawl by and pop my trunk
And everybody get to runnin' like smokin' that skunk

And ain't a motherfucker living that can hold me

See money ain't the issue niggas die for less

Money and murder the only two things on my mind
In the middle of the war it's like I'm running outta time
Bang or ball disrespect my life or my grind
And I'ma hit 'em up like 2Pac in his prime
Can't forget them days used to soak them with a wet towel
Sometimes I feel like I'm living just to die in the pen wow
Can't take my riches to the grave can't take my cash to jail
Cause they don't expect no ghetto millionaires
In the last year I've seen career and careers again
I'm smoking on some indo getting rid of my sins
How many niggas wanna ride with me
All of my soldiers strapped and they high with me
We getting rowdy rowdy ain't no need for the whisperin'

Making niggas weak and act like a hoe unstable
Rap game's been good to me
After this platinum got some ghetto stars to see
And if my nigga Silkk happen to fall
I'ma be right there to catch him and bounce back with all y'all
Now while you players be loving some them hoes
No Limit niggas be riding on 24's

And if you want some of my riches come and knock no ends

And if I have to lay the smack down with the shit

A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so
I need to know what I've done wrong

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Romeo and Juliet" by Sylk-E Fyne featuring Chill:


Where do we go nobody knows
I've gotta say "I'm sorry"; you gotta say "I'm sorry"
Cause nobody knows where we go
When we're alone in our bed at night


I don't wanna fight with you no more baby
I don't wanna fuss and cuss with you no more baby
I don't wanna stress and cry with you no more baby
Just wanna hold you tight and share my life with you baby
We've been through the ups and downs baby
We've been around the block baby
But no matter what we go through baby
You're still the one I want baby


Where do we go nobody knows
I've gotta say "I'm sorry"; you gotta say "I'm sorry"
Cause nobody knows where we go
When we're alone in our bed at night


I never thought I'd fall in love with you baby
I never thought I'd need you like I do baby
But now that you're gone baby
My heart is cold and alone baby
I wanna be your man baby
I wanna hold your hand baby
But I don't know how to make things right baby
All I know is I need you in my life baby


Where do we go nobody knows
I've gotta say "I'm sorry"; you gotta say "I'm sorry"
Cause nobody knows where we go
When we're alone in our bed at night


We gotta work it out baby
We gotta talk it out baby
We can't let our love die baby
We gotta make it right baby
I still believe in you baby
I still love you baby
So let's put our differences aside baby
And make love all night baby


Where do we go nobody knows
I've gotta say "I'm sorry"; you gotta say "I'm sorry"
Cause nobody knows where we go
When we're alone in our bed at night


Romeo and Juliet they had problems too
But they worked it out cause their love was true
Let's be like Romeo and Juliet baby
And make our love last forever

Verse 1:
When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk beside you
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you

Verse 2:
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you

Chorus:
Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days
And you don't know how or why but you've lost your way
Have no fear when your tears are fallin'
I will hear your spirit callin' and I swear to you
I will be there come what may

Verse 3:
When you need someone to guide you
I will come to you
When you're lost and all alone
And you're feelin' far from home
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you

Chorus:
Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days
And you don't know how or why but you've lost your way
Have no fear when your tears are fallin'
I will hear your spirit callin' and I swear to you
I will be there come what may

Bridge:
When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help if you need help

Chorus:
Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days
And you don't know how or why but you've lost your way
Have no fear when your tears are fallin'
I will hear your spirit callin' and I swear to you
I will be there come what may

Outro:
Oh I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
I will come to you
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said "I'm angry"
Five days since you laughed at me saying
"Get that together come back and see me"
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes
Big like Leann Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake
I like vanilla it's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous
You'll have to sign a waiver
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
Can't understand what I mean
Well you soon will
I have a history of taking off my shirt
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said "You're crazy"
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry
Chickity China the Chinese chicken
Have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting Frantic
Like Sting I'm Tantric
Like Snickers guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa I make mad films
Okay I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs just so my irons aren't always flying off the backswing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
Can't understand what I mean
Well you soon will
I have a history of losing my shirt
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides and said "I'm sorry"
Five days since I laughed at you and said
"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what can we do
Yesterday you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "The Arms of the One Who Loves You" by Xscape:


It's undeniable - that we should be together
It's unbelievable - how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know - if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all the things in time time will reveal


One - you're like a dream come true
Two - just wanna be with you
Three - girl it's plain to see that you're the only one for me
Four - repeat steps one through three
Five - make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one


It's so incredible - the way things work themselves out
And all emotional once you know what it's all about hey
And undesirable - for us to be apart
Never would've made it very far 'cause you know you've got the keys to my heart
'Cause


One - you're like a dream come true
Two - just wanna be with you
Three - girl it's plain to see that you're the only one for me
Four - repeat steps one through three
Five - make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one


Say farewell to the dark of night
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline just in the Nick of Time


One - you're like a dream come true
Two - just wanna be with you

It should have never been this way
Should have never felt the pain
But I gave my heart and soul
And I guess I loved you much too much
And you never gave anything in return
But a love that was always cold

Chorus:
We're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to end this way
Can we stop right here and say it's over

Verse 2:
Funny how love can make you feel
All alone oh but you're not
For three years I gave you my love
And you cared not for what we had
I'm walking away and I'm not coming back no more
Find someone else to save



Bridge:
Oh when I look in your eyes
I can see my own breakin' now baby
And it's breakin' my heart babe
And it makes me wonder
Why can't you feel my pain
Or are you just acting fooling yourself yeah


Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling she's living she's golden
And she lives for me
She says she lives for me
Ovation her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play she said

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life baby baby
I want something else I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye goodbye

Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish it could get back there
Someplace back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop I won't come down
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm I bump for the drop
And then I bumped up I took the hit that I was given
Then bumped again and then I bumped again

How do I get back there to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life baby baby
I want something else I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye goodbye

Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright alright

And when the plane came in the she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
And I don't know what I can do
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

And I scream for the light do you wanna feel alive
I'll stay up all night with the stars
If you are if you are

How do I get back there to the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life baby baby
I want something else I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye goodbye

I want something else
I want something else
Verse 1:
Staying home alone on a Friday
Flat on the floor looking back
On old love or lack thereof
After all the crushes are faded
And all my wishful thinking was wrong
I'm jaded I hate it

Chorus:
I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

Verse 2:
Searching all my days just to find you
I'm not sure who I'm looking for
I'll know it when I see you
Until then I'll hide in my bedroom
Staying up all night just to write
A love song for no one

Chorus:
I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

Bridge:
And oh unrequited love
Took me all the way to France
All the way to France
Woke me up to love
Thick as thieves in a dream

Chorus:
I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So hurry up and get here
So hurry up and get here

You gettin' money now you think you Mackin' now
You just forgettin' when you was duckin' down
On the dirty ground and when you hit your monthly mic check
All lights will turn off in the prospect
"You use to think that I was fly"
"Ones who picked you up when you fell down"
"Now I see you in the videos parlayin' with videos"
"Dimes with the wreck cars movado earrings"
"Laws in Tiajuana while I'm jetting to the islands"
"Welling with your mans smiling summins"
"Her and the Lexus all my real *****s" gonna flex this
"I'm off the axis girl you know my stealo"
"And it moves Jack where you hang at"


We lookin' at you
Cause you be frontin' every time we see you
Uh-huh you know what
Nah I'm sayin' though
When feedin' ya friends
And now your wills spin
I know you never seen me before
But I'm knowin' your type
Magazines front page every night
The only reason you famous
Is because of us doubted us now look at us

We started out broke "Constructing to a low"
And broke people telling jokes we soon will blow
Time to separate the pros from the cons
The platinum from the bronze
That butter soft shit from that leather on your wrist
With that gold BS you baught
I rip check my style check my gold
Check my silk people I'm killin' y'all
Sayin' "What the **** y'all can't stop him"
"They can't handle Harlem World or the way we rock 'em"
Napoleon cuz dog we lockin'
I'm Sean combs the girls dem sugar
The type of girl that'll get rush when I move her
Used to getting played now I'm gettin' blades
Runnin' with cats that chase Navigators through the picket fence
And rain disintegrate on their facades
It's Mase the millenium ****** at the plaza
Who made ya Manhattan look like a sauna
You don't wanna bad boy never a mutha
Record sales lookin' like I'm gonna stutta


We lookin' at you
Cause you be frontin' every time we see you
Uh-huh you know what
Nah I'm sayin' though
When feedin' ya friends
And now your wills spin
I know you never seen me before
But I'm knowin' your type
Magazines front page every night
The only reason you famous
Is because of us doubted us now look at us


Ha ha can't nobody take my pride
Can't nobody hold me down
Oh no I got to keep on movin'

Look at the sky
Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me
The heavens are sparkling
With starlight tonight
That's what I see
Through your eyes


I see beauty
And grace
I see the world
Never seen before
And it calls me
To open up my heart
And let it soar
I see the light
Inside you
Brighter than the stars
You shine so bright
I see the beauty
Inside you
The beauty of love


The voice of the mountains
The colors of the rainbow
A masterpiece of creation
As good as it gets
Eternal and holy
The song of the universe
That's what I see
Through your eyes


I see beauty
And grace
I see the world
Never seen before
And it calls me
To open up my heart
And let it soar

The beauty of love


Oh I see the light inside you
Shining like the stars above
Oh I'm so in love with you
My heart is open wide


I see beauty
And grace
I see the world
Never seen before
And it calls me
To open up my heart
And let it soar
I see the light
Inside you
Brighter than the stars
You shine so bright
I see the beauty
Inside you
The beauty of love
Baby oh
Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad baby

Quit playin' games with my heart with my heart
Before you tear us apart my heart
Quit playin' games with my heart

I should've known from the start
You know you've got to stop from my heart
You're tearing us apart my heart from my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart my heart with my heart
I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see sometimes Sometimes

I wish I could turn back time turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad baby baby

Quit playin' games with my heart with my heart

Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick 
And think of you 
Caught up in circles confusion 
Is nothing new 
Flashback warm nights 
Almost left behind 
Suitcases of memories 
Time after 
Sometimes you picture me 
I'm walking too far ahead 
You're calling to me I can't hear 
What you've said 
Then you say: "Go slow" 
I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 
Time after time 
If you're lost you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 
Time after time 
After my picture fades 
And darkness has turned to gray 
Watching through windows you're wondering 
If I'm OK 
Secrets stolen from deep inside 
The drum beats out of time 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 
Time after time 
If you're lost you can look and you will find me 
Time after time 
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting 
Time after time 
Time after time 
Time after time 
Time after time 
Time after time 
Time after time 
Time after time 
Time after time 
Time after time
Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning

Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying

Bury the boulders bury me next to my father in a coffin
Bury me in New Jersey I'll lay next to my daughter

And "T" landed off grounds I prayed like a monk came back with a plan
To save up the day I'm done now look at 'cha Dye-die
Bentleys Hottub Jacuzzis in the back
With a million stars make that million and one
On the rooftop with my Jamaican one

Verse 3 Redman
Yo yo
Sometimes I gotta ask what's your motive
To see if you're worth my devotion
We can cut a bed in half and both get our groove on
Tell me how deep is your love
Is it strictly physical or can you love from the soul 
If I gave you mine would you love it with a hypothec
Do you want me for me or for my Jeep or my M3 huh
Can you love me with my uh love me with my uh 
Love me with my money and everything that come with it
love me for me though but do you dig it
Sure I'm around for the physical but mental gotta get into that 
It ain't all about nuttin' I gotta have your mind and spirit 
Before I hit it let's get up and get it huh

Chorus Dru Hill
How deep is your love for me

Absolutely here are the uncensored lyrics of "I'll Be" by Edwin McCain:

The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath
And emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth
Tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

Rain falls angry on the tin roof
As we lie awake in my bed
You're my survival you're my living proof
My love is alive and not dead
Tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

And I've dropped out burned up fought my way back from the dead
Tuned in turned on remembered the things that you said

I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your

I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

I'll be the greatest fan of your life
Verse 1:
Finally I figured out but it took a long long time
But now there's a turnabout maybe 'cause I'm trying
There's been times I'm so confused all my roads they lead to you
I just can't turn and walk away

Chorus:
It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
Words can't say I can't do enough to prove
It's all for you

Verse 2:
I thought I'd seen it all 'cause it's been a long long time
Oh but then we'll trip and fall wonderin' was I blind
There's a new world if you see through the eyes of a girl
Who's reachin' out to you

Chorus:
It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
Words can't say I can't do enough to prove
It's all for you

Bridge:
All for you all for you all for you all for you

Chorus:
It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
Words can't say I can't do enough to prove
It's all for you

Outro:
I thought I'd seen it all 'cause it's been a long long time
Oh but then we'll trip and fall wonderin' was I blind
There's a new world if you see through the eyes of a girl
Who's reachin' out to you
All for you all for you all for you all for you

Uhuhuh when it comes to the dough
I get more than special niggas come and test you
And yo the dumb shit gets no progress
So of course I'm living the life that I deserve
Taking pictures with some niggas that'll never see the curve
Put it on reserve buying out the reserve
Matching cars Diamond-filled vacation bars
Every week we hitting a different star
I switch up cars just to match the clothes
I'm in a T-roof joint with two Spanish hoes
Uh-huh shout out to my man Big Mo
I'm following the back in the back of the Range
Just like the eye of a hurricane it's strange
Watching these lames waiting for me to change
Same jealousy in their eyes they can't maintain
I hit the wharf super U proper
Tell them bitches "I'm Kobe you Nick Van Excel"


Money power and respect

Lil' Kim Junior MAFIA yeah
Niggas know the time when the Lox come through
The Wu too you know how we do
I'm the rap Undertaker
Take care of the fake
And bury the dead where they can't be found
Then I'm gone on to the next town
To get down for mine putting it down
Making it shine it's on
Me and my nine we got this game on lock
Concert after concert
Taking the cake and the crumbs that follow
Shit's the joke but it's no joke
Kid we not the playing
I'm telling you now "take the money power and respect"
Still the funny style can't none of these cats take me
All they gonna do is or die trying to get close to the
source
But I'm a boss and they don't really know
What this course really costs


Money power and respect
What you need in life
Money power and respect
What you need in life


I notice that every day my brain takes me to a different page
Depending on the moves that would land me in a different wage
My mental's divided in more than twelve tribes
Turned the ladder to success into a snake and it vibes
My bullshitting days are over I extort bars 
Take careful aim conduct train robberies
I inspire tune myself channeling energy for higher
Jump over cars had the heart to let y'all niggas
be martyrs
Living trifling large  get cakes and rob China
Niggas know Mike Dior Barney's and Venegas
The double R feel squeezed gun up under young ladies
Ski masks covered our faces case the traces traces
Went cold on us in DeKalb cop the 850 rental
All that shit central park now bump my instrumental
Money power and respect
the realness
Mafia types presence felt

What's up niggas
Y'all niggas is fucking crazy
I don't give a fuck about you
Y'all niggas is crazy
I don't give a fuck about you
Y'all are not leaders


Money power and respect

Money power and respect
The only thing you need in life
Sign my name in blood
With a cursive type
And it's officially officially
All about the Benjamins  
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony this life
Trying to make ends meet you're a slave to the money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet yeah

No change I can change I can change I can change
But I'm here in my mold I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold no no no no no

Well have you ever been down Oh it's already over oh going down
Well have you ever been down
Cause I'm a high-line stepper back in town
I'm a high-line stepper back in town

Busta Rhymes
Uh oh let's go now


Oh I don't wanna be don't wanna be
The one the one the one the one
Don't wanna be don't wanna be 


You undress that body
I see you wanna party
This the mission we gon' kill it
And if they listen they gon' feel it
In the middle all on my mind
You too fine I ain't tryna waste time
We can both be slim and still shine
I'm on my grind let's both combine
Go to the crib put that music on
Get this shit cracking we've been waiting too long
Got that good love makin' it can never be wrong
That thing feeling so good it make you sing a whole song


Oh I don't wanna be don't wanna be
The one the one the one the one
Don't wanna be don't wanna be


I already see you with a king babe
Fancy car diamond ring babe
But for me that's the usual
I need more let's make it mutual
Get it started you know I'm the hottest
I'm on your neck until you're begging for it
Push you up against the wall and then record it
Whisper in your ear make you feel more important
It's level to it don't believe me
Then let me show you how it's supposed to be
Take it all off and then get close to me
Can't help but salute how you approached me


Oh I don't wanna be don't wanna be
The one the one the one the one
Don't wanna be don't wanna be


They know how we get down
All these people be looking like they wanna come join in now what
Twenty-seven years in the game I'm taking aim
And I swear I still ain't never hit the same
Steadily evolving growing bigger every time I flip
And when I come and hit you n***as oh it's gon' be some shit
Every time I'm finished with you elevate you out the ground
Watch how I deliver hit for hit and each and every sound woo
Now watch how n***as get up and all around
And watch how we make them bounce before we run them out of town


Haters better stay on guard
We getting the money we representin' God
Haters better stay on guard
We getting the money we representin' God
Haters better stay on guard woo
We getting the money we representin' God
Haters better stay on guard
We getting the money we representin' God

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Because of You" by 98 Degrees:


You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
'Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around
It's all it's all because of you


All the stars in the sky
All I want is you in my life
All I need is your love tonight
All because of you


It's not that I can't do things on my own
I just wanna be with you till we're old
You got the love that I need so much
You're the only one I wanna touch


All the stars in the sky
All I want is you in my life
All I need is your love tonight
All because of you


And when the world is through
I will still love you
Standing tall standing strong
Nothing can go wrong


All the stars in the sky
All I want is you in my life
All I need is your love tonight
All because of you
All around the world statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
Twenty-five years old my mother God rest her soul
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me baby
Put your arms around me baby
I just wanna fly
Dimpled smile on my face for her in my rear-view
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me baby
Put your arms around me baby
I just want to fly I want to fly
I just wanna fly I want to fly I want to fly I want to fly
I want to fly I want to fly I want to fly
Put your arms around me baby
Put your arms around me baby
Put your arms around me baby

All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying


And you don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lies Tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
I I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure my heart never knew such pain
And you You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you


Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream
Cinderella's got nothing on me
I will not settle for anything less
Than a prince or a princess not even the rest
Got my sights set high never let go of my fire
No one's gonna bring me down I desire
To be a star just for you
You've got to realize



And you don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lies Tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
I I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure my heart never knew such pain
And you You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you


Tell me what you know
What you know about me
Tell me 'bout my story
Tell me 'bout my story
Tell me 'bout my story
Tell me 'bout my story
And I'll sing along yeah
And I'll sing along



And you don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lies Tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
I I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure my heart never knew such pain
And you You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you


All over you All over you
I'm all cried out over you All over you
Over you Over you
Verse 1: Big Punisher

But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot

Verse 2: Big Punisher
Everyday I'm hustling every day I'm hustling
Who you loving who you wanna be hugging
Dippin' in my Bue with the Spoony-O high on the plano
Twelve-hundred seats wood grain oak though
Don't hate me player hate the game
Runnin' scams jammies and Leans even got a little thing
At the Madeline Colombianamente
You wanna meet cast Send me a letter or better
Yet your host the most slick but far from a roach
But I toast the dough from coast to coast
To make bread I host sweet ten can we meet Hit the park let's drink
Fool that's a no-go she knows the Chicano
And she's hit him off with "I'm not a player"

Chorus: Joe
I'm not a player I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot

Verse 3: Big Punisher
I'm the one she gotta see however to gain love
It's all graded how rated I'm glad you made it
Got a grenadine at the bar and I'm just daring you to stare at me wrong
'Til Tinky whip me out the spot baby move on
To the next chick that's checkin' out my necklace
Saying "Resplendent trying to get a little bit"
I'm lying like a rug trying to get a little buzz
Over her because never taking chicks serious
I'm you better off buying a Ferrari Trego
Yo Fonny I'm tired of living dizzy
The last time you wrote you said "The murder was business"
I'm like "Nah hey Ray why I gotta play layoffs"
Sick of these crabby chicks acting up with heat
But my money's thicker than the bloodclot huh asking me
Featuring Pattie Labelle
I'm like "Listen baby be with me baby"
"I'll make you see that I'm not a player"
"I just crush a lot"

Chorus: Joe
I'm not a player I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot

Verse 4: Big Punisher
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Take you on a natural joint hit you off on the staircase
For the dare chase boo not to scare
Face the world kick the trics over there
You heard me it's like "Me and my thirst be
Riding dirty cursed be the day that I ain't able to chase a heiney"
Thirsty for my lemon-lime I reminisce over my ghetto princess
Every day a new chick wanna fling my ring
Only problem is I'm a one-woman man
And it's a year later she's still in the palm of my hand
So I crush a lot and the sensation slut
I need some get back prop with a jet pack
Swiftly drifting in the seas of Belize
What more do you want from me yeah
Sometimes I wanna be D'Angelo
How does it feel no one to hold
Concede now let it breathe I sweat the technique
Don't wanna be a player no more I'm not a player
I just crush a lot

Chorus: Joe
I'm not a player I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "The One I Gave My Heart To" by Aaliyah:

How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad
Won't somebody tell me
So I can understand
If you love me how could you hurt me like that

How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away
How could the one who said "I love you"
Say the things you say
How could the one I was so true to
Just tell me lies
If you're looking for a love that's true
I'm still here but baby you should know this by now:

How could you love me and then
Leave me and never say goodbye
When I can't sleep at night without
Holding you tight
Girl every time I try to
Leave something keeps telling me
That baby I'm needing you in my life

How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine
Tell me
How could you be so cold to me
When I gave you everything
All my love all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door
How could you not love me no more
I thought we had forever
I can't understand how
How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery
Won't somebody tell me
Somebody tell me please
If you love me why would you hurt me

How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad
Won't somebody tell me
So I can understand
If you love me how could you hurt me like that
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Foolish Games" / "You Were Meant for Me" by Jewel:

You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care
You stood in my doorway with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees and

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

And I'm feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

These foolish games
Are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words
Are breaking my heart

You're breaking my heart

These foolish games
You're tearing me you're tearing me
You're tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words
You're breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
You're always tearing me apart
And you always almost always
Can make it right
Yes you always almost always
Can make it right
Just a little bit wrong
You're always almost always
You're always almost always
Verse 1:
What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back back into time
When the only people that existed were troglodytes
Cave man cave woman the Neanderthal
Progenitors intellectual mammoth
The small-brained Neanderthalers
Were real heavy thinkers didn't have no calculators
No pencils no paper no telephone
Just a bunch of rocks and two sticks to rub together

Chorus:
Love you down down
Way down down
Verbal expression…delicate sound
Sing it girl

Verse 2:
What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back back into time
When the only people that existed were troglodytes
Cave man cave woman the Neanderthal
Progenitors intellectual mammoth
The small-brained Neanderthalers
Were real heavy thinkers didn't have no calculators
No pencils no paper no telephone
Just a bunch of rocks and two sticks to rub together

Chorus:
Love you down down

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Do for Love" by 2Pac featuring Eric Williams:


Turn it up loud
Hahaha ahahaha hey man
You a little sucker for love right
Word up hahahahaha


I should've seen
You was trouble right from the start taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match perhaps
We had some problems but we was gettin' at it
And now the arguments are getting loud
I wanna stay but I can't help from walkin' out
Let's throw it away
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be You're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free I can't breathe
As soon as I leave it's like a trap I hear you callin'
Want me back I'm fallin' in and outta love with you
Can't decide if I should stay or go gotta make the best of it
Guess I'll have to but I gotta let you go


Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a surefire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down
And all you know is when I'm with you I'm in a freefall
Yeah think it's time to cut the chord


You said you'd die for me but now I'm havin' doubts
Remember when you used to take me everywhere and
But now it seems your too much drama just to be with you is a headachin'
Guess I gotta count my losses it's time to break ties
Niggas tellin' me you got fault lines
What a surprise we started out cool it seems I always lose
When it comes to trusting me you must've got confused
You was the man couldn't nobody do you better
Codependent love don't live here anymore
See I done had a little bit too much of that
Lately just can't seem to get enough of that
So I'm out the door and I won't look back
I'm a playa that's where the focus is at


Can't nobody understand me but my woman
I need somebody who's down to champion
So I gotta find someone
Who's ready when I'm ready who's willing to go
I ain't lookin' for nothin' else just somethin' to call my own
I'm a man and a man needs love in his life
So I guess I'll be alright


Am I a fool Gotta get over
Cause wilin' out ain't doin' nothing for me
And truth be told you really ain't ready fo' real
It's such a pity
So I'm sayin' my goodbyes
Leavin' today
Cause your live love it ain't no kind of love
And I'm out just like a shove
Ain't no need for me to stay
Your angry vibe ain't nothin' but pain


What you won't do do for love
Is try to making things that's bad to good
What I wouldn't do for you for love
Should've known better when you came around
That you was gonna make me a run-around
I just never thought that you would hurl me down


Hey yo 'Pac let me kick it to you right quick
Man not on some gangsta shit man on some real shit
Anytime you need somebody to bust some heads for you
Man you know I'm always down
Just give me a call 1-800-274-7665
And I'm with you that's for real man you know what I'm sayin'
I gotta say something else too though man
You know a lady by the name of Monique
She lost her son damn that shit is dope
I just wanna say rest in peace little man
Verse 1: Luke
I like big butts and I can't deny
All these other brothers can't deny
When a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Chorus: No Good But So Good
Raise the roof
All the ladies with the big booties
Raise the roof
All the fellas that appreciate it
Raise the roof
Everybody get up get loud
Everybody get up and shout it out loud

Verse 2: Luke
Baby got back
I like 'em round and big
And when I'm throwing a gig
I just can't help myself I'm acting like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And UH double up UH UH
I ain't talking 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys

Chorus: No Good But So Good
Raise the roof
All the ladies with the big booties
Raise the roof
All the fellas that appreciate it
Raise the roof
Everybody get up get loud
Everybody get up and shout it out loud

Breakdown

Chorus: No Good But So Good

Girls they wanna nose bone me
But I don't really think my homies gon' free this chick
Till they hear about JD getting rich

Platinum baby that's what's next for me
Five four three two one

Make it feel like you're in the front row
The party ain't over till the DJ says so


It's the whole gang what
From Chicago to Los Angeles
And back to Atlanta what
Can't nobody handle us uh-uh
Been about the hood
Since I was a child there were no ifs ands buts
Wishing wanting to be like me uh-huh
But I ain't worried about a damn thing
Let's drink to it smoke to it
Playas hoes and 'bows to it
Nine millimeters 45s and  
I'm quick to bust a cap like I'm O-Dog
In "Menace to Society" what


The party ain't over till the DJ says so
If you came to get crazy get up on the floor
I like the way you move boy don't go slow
Make it feel like you're in the front row
The party ain't over till the DJ says so


If you're feeling good and you know it
Clap your hands if you're feeling good and you know it clap your hands
If you're feeling good and you know it
Clap your hands if you're feeling good and you know it clap your hands


The party ain't over till the DJ says so
If you came to get crazy get up on the floor
I like the way you move boy don't go slow
Make it feel like you're in the front row
The party ain't over till the DJ says so

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Butta Love" by Next:


I wanna sex you
After hours
You know my love will
Give you superpowers
Just wait and see
Look what you did to me
Your love's so sweet
Knocked me off my feet


You got me open like the sea
I think you know that's why you lovin' me
You got me freakin' nasty as can be
And I'm lov'in every moment that you're givin' me


I wanna sex you
After hours
You know my love will
Give you superpowers
Just wait and see
Look what you did to me
Your love's so sweet
Knocked me off my feet


You make me wanna come over tonight
Pull up to your crib and turn off all the lights
Out of all the guys that are chasing me
You showed me lovin' unselfishly


I wanna sex you
After hours
You know my love will
Give you superpowers
Just wait and see
Look what you did to me
Your love's so sweet

And groove me baby groove me

Look what you did to me
Your love's so sweet
Knocked me off my feet
Verse 1:
There was a rose I knew I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth

Chorus:
She's just a flower a flower no she's not a tree
You let her wilt too afraid to be the light that shines within your eyes

Verse 2:
So-called friends come in all sizes
Intentions fall between two thighs
Invest your time don't waste mine
I am a rose I am a rose same ol' G

Chorus:
A rose is still a rose baby girl you're still a flower
He can leave you and then take you make you and then break you
Darlin' you hold the power

Verse 3:
Her life was syrupy sweet till you decided to taste
Allowed her pedals to fall now she waits patiently for roses to come
She's bruised by the thorn oh
What's the matter dear
Was it a matter of love or just a matter of lust

Chorus:
A rose is still a rose baby girl you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you make you and then break you
Darlin' you hold the power

Outro:
What's a matter what's a matter baby
Whoa whoa
You hold the world yeah yeah yeah
In the palm of your hand
You hold the power
A rose is still a rose baby girl you're still a flower
He can leave you and then take you make you and then break you
Darlin' you hold the power
What's a matter what's a matter baby
Whoa whoa
Verse 1:
I long for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

Chorus:
When I get up each day
And I see the sunrise
I'm reminded of the life
That we once had
But we let it slip away
We thought we'd be okay
But we lost it all
For 4 seasons of loneliness

Verse 2:
The nights can be so cold
Without your embrace
I dream of holding you
And seeing your face
But now those dreams are memories in time
I wish you were here with me
Right by my side

Chorus

Bridge:
Oh girl I'd give my all to have
Just one more chance to hold you close
To me and say goodbye

If I could just hold you again
Oh girl oh girl

Chorus
Verse 1:
Father I stretch
Stretch my hands to you
Lifeguard surfin'
Surfin' all these waves to you
Hey look man
You owe me man
I sacrificed man
Uh I had to find out the hard way
That you ain't even appreciate a little bit of nothing I did
Huh

Verse 2:
Ungrateful
Ungrateful
Ungrateful man
Father I stretch
Stretch my hands to you
Lifeguard surfin'
Surfin' all these waves
I'm drownin'
Drownin' in the blood of my kin
I drown in the blood of my kin
And if I don't make it
If I don't make it

Know that I was a prophet

Know that I did it behold
Cap hat clap back

Salute to the dead but fuck the living
Tell me if I sing this shit before I die
Joke's on you high-five I'm bulletproof

Straight up to my face straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me

Straight up to my face straight up to my face
Verse 3:
Only fuck wit' your realness
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
To all these people that think they know me best
I got a whole lotta blood nigga
Go against me you won't have no luck
Don't get me mixed up with no sucka-ass nigga
It's all politics is usual
Text book committee meetings

Nobody's supposed to be here

My heart says no no
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

Chorus:
I've spent all my life

My heart got broken oh it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again

Verse 2:
So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here standing here

But you keep showing up everywhere
I did my best to try and stay away from you
But I don't know what to do

Chorus:
I've spent all my life
On a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity

But when I turn around

How could you love someone like me
When you know that you're gonna say goodbye

The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs

That's why

I could provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith but please note that the lyrics contain some explicit language 

"I could stay awake just to hear you breathing 
Watch you smile while you are sleeping 
Far away and dreaming 
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender 
I could stay lost in this moment forever 
Cause every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep 
Cause I'd miss you babe 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you babe 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating 
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming 
Wondering if it's me you're seeing 
And then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together 
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever 
Forever and ever 

Don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep 
Cause I'd miss you babe 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you babe 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

I don't wanna miss one smile 
I don't wanna miss one kiss 
I just wanna be with you 
Right here with you just like this 

I just wanna hold you close 
Feel your heart so close to mine 
And just stay here in this moment 
For all the rest of time 

Don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep 
Cause I'd miss you babe 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you babe 
And I don't wanna miss a thing"
I don't know if it's possible for me to provide uncensored lyrics without violating community guidelines or offending anyone However I can provide you with the original lyrics without any commentary or additional information:

I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry
I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby 'Hello' Oh 'Goodbye'
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's impossible
This kiss this kiss unstoppable
This kiss this kiss
Cinderella said to Snow White
"How does love get so off course
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart soft touch fast horse"
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby I'm forever yours
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's impossible
This kiss this kiss unstoppable
This kiss this kiss
You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let everything slide
You got me floating
You got me flying
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's impossible
This kiss this kiss unstoppable
This kiss this kiss
It's the way you love me baby
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's impossible
This kiss this kiss unstoppable
This kiss this kiss unstoppable

Yeah we bout to ride up on these fools
It's 'bout to be some drama 'bout to be some drama


Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride


They on the block posted up lookin' at me
What they do
They showin' no love so they gon' get none from me
I'm thinkin' of takin'  like Goodfellas
What you gon' do
You know lay 'em down spray 'em down it's whatever
They messin' with a No Limit Soldier I thought they knew
I'm like Teflon I ain't gon' let these haters ruin my crew
I mean what I say I say what I mean
I'm like that tank on the No Limit logo know what I mean
I'm 'bout four seconds from losin' my patience
You messin' with greatness and this is an understatement
I'm like Tyson they like Michael Spinks
What you gon' do
I'ma be all over 'em before they blink


Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride


It's goin' down tonight
Ain't gon' be no fight just a celebration
Of rhymes and beats and life
We gon' keep it movin' we're not looking for trouble
You can't slow us down this is how we move double
Trouble ain't nothin' but a fuss and a fight
But we gon' party tonight showin' the world what it's like
To get crunk to get buck to have a good time
Another song another rhyme another rhythm and line
Yeah we rollin' deep that's how we do it that's how we ride
With our head's up high no need to hide
That's how we keep our pride that's how we survive


Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride


From the South to the West or the East up top
Same story different city that's how we ride non-stop
What the deal
You don't want beef you don't want none
Master P known to bust shots whether or not you got a gun
I'm from the ghetto but I'm like a diamond in the rough
What you say
I stay connected and respected through all the tough stuff
They don't wanna see us make it they don't wanna see us bubble
But we keep on rollin' hustlin' and grindin' workin' through the struggle
Yeah it don't stop it won't stop we move it like a freight train
With the force of a Mack truck we keep pushin' never complain
From the Bay to the A from the Chi to LA
What you say
We serve it up No Limit style three million sold today


Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Verse 1:
Hello
Do you ever think of me
Somewhere in the shadows of your mind
Oh tangled in the memories you could never leave behind

Verse 2:
Well I've been meaning to call you
And tell you I'm coming home
But then something went wrong
And I ended up alone

Chorus:
So kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn

Verse 3:
Keep in mind
We're under the same sky
And the night's
As empty for me as for you

Verse 4:
If you feel you can't wait till morning
Kiss the rain kiss the rain
Kiss the rain kiss the rain

Chorus:
So kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn

Verse 5:
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

Chorus:
So kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun

She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began

She's got herself a little piece of heaven
But it's still a long long way to go

Now I'm dancing on the valentine
Dancing on the valentine

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else shall be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when
Earth shall be as one

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Quicker than a ray of light
 

Mmm oh yeah 

 

Is it better better better better now 

I got this feeling and it's deep in my soul 

Let's just hold hands and take control 

I can feel your every wish as it's coming through 

There's no mistaking we're about to break 

 

Touch it bring it baby watch it 

Turn it leave it start format it 

Touch it bring it baby watch it 

Turn it leave it start format it 

 

Come on baby just give it a try 

We can start it slow and let it build 

We can take it higher higher higher still 

I'll whisper secrets I'll tell you lies 

I can be your fantasy whatever you desire 

Just get closer baby closer reach out and feel my fire 

 

Touch it bring it baby watch it 

Turn it leave it start format it 

Touch it bring it baby watch it 

Turn it leave it start format it 

 

Don't hesitate just take me 

Love me touch me feel me 

And if you want you can have me 

And if you need come and get me 

 

Touch it bring it baby watch it 

Turn it leave it start format it 

Touch it bring it baby watch it 

Turn it leave it start format it 

 

Turn it leave it start format it 

Turn it leave it start format it 

Turn it leave it start format it 

Turn it leave it start format it

Verse 1:
Sitting here trying to
Think of words that won't hurt you
But nothing comes to mind
Maybe the time has come
To set my feelings free
Cause I think you know anyway

I don't ever want to see you again
But the love we had was good
I don't ever want to see you again
But I'll always miss you babe
I don't ever want to see you again
Verse 2:
The letters that you gave me
Were just a waste of time
I'm gonna throw them all away
Maybe tomorrow
You'll call me on the phone
And tell me you're alone
But I don't know what to say
Chorus:
I don't ever want to see you again
But the love we had was good
I don't ever want to see you again
But I'll always miss you babe
I don't ever want to see you again

But that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it

But that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it

But the love we had was good
I don't ever want to see you again
But I'll always miss you babe
I don't ever want to see you again

Lately Yo yo yo


Can't lie I've been been thinking 'bout you lately
Can't lie I've been been thinking 'bout you crazy
I don't know no I don't know no I don't know why
Why we can't have it how we had it on the daily on the daily

Miss the morning when I'd wake up to your thighs
Miss the way we used to vibe

So tell me what I gotta do to make it happen
You know I'll do whatever just to have it
And every time I'm with somebody else it's not the same
Cause I'm thinking 'bout the times and how we had it how we had it
You know me you know my body
You know what I like and you know how to work my body
Can't lie I've been been thinking 'bout you lately

And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
