Girl you know we belong together  
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this  
You'll be mine forever baby you just see  
We belong together and you know that I'm right  
Why do you play with my heart why do you play with my mind  
Said we'd be forever said it'd never die  
How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye  

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight  
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry  
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead  
Spinning around and around although we've come  
To the end of the road  

Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural you belong to me I belong to you  

Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural you belong to me I belong to you  

Girl I know you really love me you just don't realise  
You've never been there before it's only your first time  
Maybe I'll forgive you maybe you'll try  
We should be happy together forever you and I  

Will you love me again like you loved me before  
This time I want you to love me much more  
This time instead lay your body close to mine  
Don't think of tomorrow don't think of the time  
Girl we know we've got each other  
And that's a lot for love  
We'll give it a shot  

Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural you belong to me I belong to you  

Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural you belong to me I belong to you  

Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural you belong to me I belong to you  

Come to the end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural you belong to me I belong to you

So they can lock me up and charge me

Just keeps on rappin'  
Smiling still stylin'  
While in my grandma's basement  
The JD's for the look-a-like  
Leaning just aching  
For a chance and kinda wishing  
Two fives for a thirty-eight  
Ask for weight never have to deal with heavy wait  
So play with Kay 'cause she's a revelation  
And I'm a straight-up weed-up indication  
I'm A and W not the root beer

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you yeah

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

La da da da la da da

La da da da da da da da da

La da da da

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last
Yeah

La da da da la da da

La da da da da da da da da

La da da da la da da

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Baby-Baby-Baby" by TLC:


It's 3 AM and I'm feeling kinda lonely 
Just wanna know if you think of me 
You're like my best friend 
But a love like this may never end 


I never knew love before 
Then came you boy you're so much more 
Than anyone I ever known 
I'm head over heels love you to the bone 


Baby baby baby love you so 
My baby my baby don't ever let me go 
Oh baby baby baby I'll never let you go 
I'll never let you go 


I was in love and I thought you were too 
But then you said that you're not feeling it boo 
So I had to let you go 
I know you want to come back but I won't let it show 


Baby baby baby love you so 
My baby my baby don't ever let me go 
Oh baby baby baby I'll never let you go 
I'll never let you go 


Sometimes I wished upon a star 
Wanted to be wherever you are 
But nothing's ever what it seems 
That's why our love is like a dream 


Baby baby baby love you so 
My baby my baby don't ever let me go 
Oh baby baby baby I'll never let you go 
I'll never let you go 


Never let you go 
Never let you go 
Never let you go
Sometimes I feel like
I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
That is a lie

Well I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
As lonely as I am
Together we cry

Well I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away

Yeah yeah
Ooh no no no no
Yeah yeah
Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away
Morning alone
When you come home
I breathe a little faster
Every time we're together
It never be the same
If you're not here
How can you stay away so long
Why can't we stay together
chorus
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
I I don't wanna say it
Baby I love you
But I'm into something right now
Until I find a way
I say another prayer
For you to come my way
And my heart stops
When you call my name
It's just another day
Tell me more
About your life
Every time we're together
There's so much to talk about
All the things I wanna know
What you feel what you think
We're learning to let it go
We're learning to love each other
chorus
I I see you I wanna touch you
I wanna breathe into your heart
I don't wanna think
I wanna feel and how do you feel
Tell me how do you feel
chorus x2
Hold on little girl
Show me what he's done to you
Stand up little girl
A broken heart can't be that bad
When it's through it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on baby come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up who cares about
Little boys that talk too much
I've seen it all go down
Your game of love was all rained out
So come on baby come on over
Let me be the one to hold you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

Why be alone when we can be together baby
You can make my life worthwhile
And I can make you start to smile

When it's through it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on baby come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

Love's going to leave me  
And I'm too sexy for this song
You can tell the world
You never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends
Just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone

You can tell my arms go back
To the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Ooo

You can tell your Ma
I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lips
He never really liked me anyway

Or tell your Aunt Louise
Tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

But don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Ooo

But don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Ooo

Don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

Ooo
Yeah yeah
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love I'll be there I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there I'll be there
And oh I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you yeah
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness well it's all I'm after

And oh I'll be there to protect you
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name and I'll be there I'll be there

I'll be there I'll be there yeah yeah
I'll be there I'll be there
Just call my name I'll be there I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders honey
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate to break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands

From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long

There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once but now we look it in the eye

Ooh yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long

Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long
If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long

Life is a highway
Do you remember when we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end
Do you remember back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare
Tell me do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Do you remember
How we used to talk ya know
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so I'll never let you go
Do you remember back in the spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember those special times
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love remember the time
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love remember the time
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love remember the time
This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need
Of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say
Don't look back
Keep your head held high
Don't ask them why
Because life is short
And before you know
You're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask
This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need
Of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say
Don't look back
Keep your head held high
Don't ask them why
Because life is short
And before you know
You're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask
Why why did it have to end
And why and why do they always say
Don't look back never never never look back
Keeper your head held high
And don't ask them why
Because life is too short
But before you know
You're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask
This used to be my playground
Used to be the place I ran
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say
Don't look back don't you ever look back
Keep your head held high
Never be afraid to try
Life is short but not a lie
You're feeling old but not the end
Now I don't want to lose you but I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry

That don't really matter to anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough

Now I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby you don't have to take the fall
Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder it makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home when it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed there beside you
Where I used to lay
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Oh sometimes love just ain't enough

Don't don't let go don't let go


Ever since you came into my life
I've been so happy every day
And there's no one else who can do
What you do for me no way


When I'm alone with you
I feel like I'm in paradise
I know that you feel it too
I can see it in your eyes


I can't let go no no
You're the one I need oh
I can't let go no no
You're the one I need oh


Whenever we're together
It feels so right so real so true
And I never want to let you go
I just want to hold on to you


When we're together baby
It's like we're in our own little world
I know that you're the one for me
And I'm the only girl


I can't let go no no
You're the one I need oh
I can't let go no no
You're the one I need oh


No one else can make me feel
The way that you do
And there's no one else who can love me
Like the way you do


I can't let go no no
You're the one I need oh
I can't let go no no
You're the one I need oh


Don't don't let go don't let go

This will be the day 
That you will hear me say 
That I will never run away 
I am here for you 
Love is meant for two 
Now tell me what you're gonna do 


If I gave you diamonds and pearls 
Would you be a happy boy or a girl 
If I could I would give you the world 
All I can do is just offer you my love 


Which one of us is right 
If we always fight 
Why can't we just let love decide Let love decide 
And forget our foolish pride 


If I gave you diamonds and pearls 
Would you be a happy boy or a girl 
If I could I would give you the world 
All I can do is just offer you my love 


Life is just a game 
We're all just the same 
Do you want to play 
Do you want to play 


If I gave you diamonds and pearls 
Would you be a happy boy or a girl 
If I could I would give you the world 
All I can do is just offer you my love 


If I gave you diamonds and pearls 
Diamonds and pearls 
If I gave you all of my love 
I would give you all of my love 
If I gave you diamonds and pearls 
Diamonds and pearls 
If I gave you all of my love 
I would give you all of my love
Yes I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Masterpiece" by Atlantic Starr:

Ooh how I love you
My darling
But I'm a lonely fool
I give you all I am
It never seems to be enough for you
But you're the love of my life
You're my golden girl
I'll love you till the end of time
But I need to know if you'll stay or go
'Cause if you're gonna leave me
Let me love you for the last time
You're a masterpiece
A work of art
I wanna spend my life trying to figure out
The crazy things that you do
'Cause you're a masterpiece
A work of art
I wanna spend my life trying to figure out
The crazy things that you do
You're the light of my life
My sun in the morning
My moon at night
I never want to let you go
But I can't seem to make you mine
So tell me if you'll stay or go
'Cause if you're gonna leave me
Let me love you for the last time
You're a masterpiece
A work of art
I wanna spend my life trying to figure out
The crazy things that you do
'Cause you're a masterpiece
A work of art
I wanna spend my life trying to figure out
The crazy things that you do
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "If You Asked Me To" by Celine Dion:


Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again darling
I said I'd never let nobody in
But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever


If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
I just might write these words
And let you read them everyday


I hope that you would learn to love me
Something that you've never done before
I know we just met but I'm willing to bet
That you'd open up your heart and you'd let me love you
I'd soothe you I'd move you
I'd fill you with passion and desire
I'd be your lover I'd be your best friend
Everything that you need in a woman
If you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever


If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
I just might write these words
And let you read them everyday


Now ain't that love or what
And ain't that something for us
When somebody's willing to give their all
Even though you didn't give your heart at all
If you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever


If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
I just might write these words
And let you read them everyday


If you asked me to
If you asked me to
If you asked me to
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Giving Him Something He Can Feel" by En Vogue:

Many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from
But you will see it's just a matter of time
My love's gonna surely make you mine

Well I'm
Living in a world of ghetto life
Everyone is so uptight
Nothin's wrong it's alright my man
I like the way we carry on his love will send me on and on
With my man

People out there can understand
That I'm giving him something he can feel
To let them know this love is real

Giving him something he can feel
To let them know this love is real

You know there's nothin like a real love oh
To let you know that you're alive
It's like trying to find that pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And I'm not giving up I'm gonna stand by my man
We've got a lot of work to do love will see us through


People out there can understand
That I'm giving him something he can feel
To let them know this love is real

Giving him something he can feel
To let them know this love is real

Ain't nothin wrong with love if you want the best of it
You sometimes have to sweat
No rivers or mountains can keep us apart
'Cause we've got love in our heart


People out there can understand
That I'm giving him something he can feel
To let them know this love is real

Giving him something he can feel
To let them know this love is real

People out there can understand
That I'm giving him something he can feel
To let them know this love is real


Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Come and Talk to Me" by Jodeci:


I've been watching you for so very long
Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong
I really want to meet you but I'm kind of scared
'Cause you're the kinda lady with so much class
I get my thoughts together for the very next day
But when I see you lady I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair are such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk is killing me inside


I need to have you in my life girl
You take my heart away
With your smile
Come with me take me home
Let's make this night our night


I'll never forget the way you looked that night
I wore the same cologne as I did on our first date
I'll wrap you up in my arms and never let you go
I'll never let you go no-no


Girl I must confess my heart beats for you
And only you
You take my heart away with everything you do
And I want to be right by your side
All day and all night oh baby yeah


Come and talk to me I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you I really want to know you
Come and talk to me I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you I really want to know you


Girl I must confess my heart beats for you
And only you
You take my heart away with everything you do
And I want to be right by your side
All day and all night oh baby yeah
Load up on guns
bring your friends
It's fun to lose
and to pretend
She's over bored
and self-assured
Oh no I know
a dirty word

Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low

Verse 1:
I'll do anything 
That you say 
I'll be anyone 
You want me to be 
I'll give everything 
I've got for your love 
But I won't be had 
Been through too much of that 
My emotions 
Are frayed 
And I I gotta decide 
Just where I'm going 
And what I need 
And how to rectify 
The fact that you and I 
Will never be 

Chorus:
So tell me what you want me to do 
I'll do it baby 
Tell me what you want me to do 
And I'll do it baby 
Whatever you want 

Verse 2:
The love I had for you 
Is gone 
The respect I had for you 
Has faded 
And now you think you can 
Just come back in my life 
Making demands 
Asking me to be your wife 
I'm not about to share 
My life with someone who don't care 
About the way I feel 
And I I gotta decide 
Just where I'm going 
And what I need 
And how to rectify 
The fact that you and I 
Will never be 

Chorus:
So tell me what you want me to do 
I'll do it baby 
Tell me what you want me to do 
And I'll do it baby 
Whatever you want 

Bridge:
Ooh you know I've tried 
To make a compromise 
But I can't adjust 
To this love jive 
Been pushing back my pride 
Trying to keep love alive 
But now it's time to find 
Someone who's worthy of me 

Chorus:
So tell me what you want me to do 
I'll do it baby 
Tell me what you want me to do 
And I'll do it baby 
Whatever you want 

Outro:

How do I say goodbye to what we had
The good times that made us laugh outweighed the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away it's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

I don't know where this road is going to lead
All I know is where we've been and what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen:

Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come easy go
Little high little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me to me

Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now he's dead
Mama life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late my time has come
Sent shivers down my spine body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all



I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche Scaramouche can you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo Galileo
Galileo Galileo
Galileo Figaro - magnificoo

I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah No we will not let you go
Let him go Bismillah We will not let you go
Let him go Bismillah We will not let you go
Let me go Will not let you go
Let me go Will not let you go
Let me go Ah No no no no no no no
Oh mama mia mama mia mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

I hope that helps
Verse 1:
Lord I've really been real stressed
Down and out losin ground
Although I am black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic

Brothers and sisters keep messin up
Why does it have to be so damn tough
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull

My grandmas' grandma's' grandma's' used to say
"Son if you can't find somethin' to live for
You best find somethin' to die for"

Chorus:
That's why You can't hold me down
real talk real talk
That's why You can't hold me down
cause you know you know
That's why You can't hold me down

Verse 2:
I live in a tenement
Housing with no rent
Roaches everywhere
Weird smells comin' out of my neighbors' door
Suffocatin' heat
Unemployment checks drug testin' welfare checks
Somebody help me but nah they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be di-ss-o-cia-tive

Chorus:
That's why You can't hold me down
Real talk real talk
That's why You can't hold me down
Cause you know you know
That's why You can't hold me down

Bridge:
I met a girl from Tennessee
She told me she was true to me
Lyin' wasn't her destiny
But I couldn't keep her from my mind
My friends said I'm blind a fool
To think that she was really true
I guess I'll always be a dreamer

Chorus:
That's why You can't hold me down
Real talk real talk
That's why You can't hold me down
Cause you know you know
That's why You can't hold me down

Outro:
That's why You can't hold me down
Say brother don't you let it
That's why You can't hold me down
get you down
That's why You can't hold me down
Verse 1: Luther Vandross
Keep your diamond ring
Keep your fancy car
It does little girl to impress me
I don't need your money 'cause honey
I'm a millionaire
I've got love girl and I've got joy
And I know that you'll agree

Chorus: Luther Vandross & Janet Jackson

Verse 2: Janet Jackson
I'm here to tell you

So don't you let anybody
Turn you away

Sometimes you're ahead sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end it's only with yourself
Love yourself cherish yourself and most importantly
Believe in yourself

The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered what you mean to me
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free

Outro: Luther Vandross & Janet Jackson
Never you mind what's your name
Cause we gon' have a good time y'all
All the best things in life are free
Get yourself together let's have a good time y'all

I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands


In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit


All I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun


You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one


There are caravans we follow
Drummers drumming by your side
People circling round you
Somewhere deep inside


It's all we've ever needed
Baby you're the one


It's all we've ever needed
Baby you're the one
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me crazy ooh do
Feelings of an ah ah in my head
And truthfully I wanna get high with you

Take me to the place where lives are made
And let love be that music that we play
And let love be that music that we play

Chorus:
Feel that beat never miss a beat
Ooh-ooh

Set adrift on

Chorus:
Feel that beat never miss a beat
Ooh-ooh

Set adrift on

Open sesame here comes the key to my heart
You're welcome come in and take off your coat
Just leave the worries in the rain on the brain
You can blow them away blow them away

Mic check one two on the scene Stepper's delight
Electric Boogaloo on the stretch
And on and on at the break of dawn
You know we couldn't get much higher

Chorus:
Feel that beat never miss a beat
Ooh-ooh

Set adrift on dreamful bliss
Come and get it slip into transcendental
Instrumental zip into everything you wanna be

Here we go yo here we go yo
So what's the scenario Here we go yo
Set adrift on memory bliss of you and
Set adrift on memory bliss
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Verse 1:
So take uh deep breath and don't move
Cause I'm about to rip the mic out your hand
and destroy your groove
I wanna know why you're ignoring me
yo Hammer Yo Hammer
And why you're frontin' on my man MC Hammer
he say he wanna diss you He ain't dissin' nobody except himself
So you can take that and get a grip alright
Or you can hip-hop to this huh and get a grip

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I'd Die Without You" by PM Dawn:


Is it my turn to wish you were lying here
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world
Or even imagine your emotions to tell myself anything


Is it my turn to hold you by your hands
Tell you I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing


If I have to give away the feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice for your happiness
I will gladly do it
Cause if love is true true true
Then this is how I feel


Tell me you love me and I'll be yours forever
Tell me you love me and I'll give you my soul
Tell me you love me and I'll be forever yours
Forever yours


Is it my turn to hold you by your hands
Tell you I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing


If I had to give away the feeling that I feel
If I had to sacrifice for your happiness
I will gladly do it
Cuz if love is true true true
Then I'm sure that this is how I feel
Loving you baby baby baby
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Good for Me" by Amy Grant:

I got a lot of habits I can't explain
Caught up in my thoughts again feelin' anxious
Ain't got no one to blame but me
These situations keep endin' up the same

And I'm thinkin' maybe I should just get outta here
I'm stuck inside a daydream that keeps turnin' out all wrong
I know I let you down I know it's not your fault
But I'm so damn tired of always feelin' bad

It's good for me yeah I'm good for you
I can be what you want me to
It's good for me yeah I'm good for you
I can be what you want me to

I've been here before I know I'm not sain
I'm tired of tryna hide all my fears
I don't know what else to do but pray
Cause that's what you're supposed to do when you're drivin' in a hurricane

And I'm thinkin' maybe I should just get outta here
I'm stuck inside a memory that hasn't happened yet
And I'm sick of always feelin' like I'm at the vet
And I'm so damn tired of always feelin' bad

It's good for me yeah I'm good for you
I can be what you want me to
It's good for me yeah I'm good for you
I can be what you want me to

And I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along

My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want yeah

It's good for me yeah I'm good for you
I can be what you want me to
It's good for me yeah I'm good for you
I can be what you want me to
When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found

If she is bad he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well this man loves you woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your precious love
Baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool

He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby baby
You're my world

When a man loves a woman
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Can't Dance" by Genesis:

Hot sun beating down
burning my feet just walking around
Hot sun making me sweat
Gators getting close hasn't got me yet
I can't dance I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

Blue jeans sitting on the beach
her dog's talking to me but she's out of reach
She's got a body under that shirt
but all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt

'Cause I can't dance I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling

Oh I'm checking everything is in place
you never know who's looking on
young punk spilling beer on my shoes
fat guys talking to me trying to steal my blues
Thick smoke see her smiling through
I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool

But I can't dance I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything
Johnny take a walk
With your sister in the moon
Let her pale light in
To fill up your room
You've been living underground
Eating from a can
You've been running away
From what you don't understand

Love

She's slippy
You're sliding down
She'll be there when you hit the ground
It's alright it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways


Johnny take a dive
With your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things
You cannot explain
To touch is to heal
To hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky
Better learn how to kneel
On your knees boy


She's the wave
She turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child yeah
It's alright it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
Ah
It's alright it's alright
Lift my days light up my nights
One day you'll look back
And you'll see
Where you were held
Now you'll see
You were held
Ah
It's alright it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright it's alright
We move through miracle days
Spirit moves in mysterious ways
Ah
Love
Verse 1:
I hear her voice in my mind like a summer breeze
Whispering softly temptation’s calling me
The eyes of temptation ignite the flame
And what she’s offering is hard to explain

Chorus:
How do you talk to an angel
How do you hold her close to where you are
How do you talk to an angel
It's like trying to catch a falling star

Verse 2:
They say it's all in the kiss but where does that leave me
Are there different kinds of kisses that she’ll receive
Kiss her once she might fly away
And leave you standing there just talking to the air

Chorus:
How do you talk to an angel
How do you hold her close to where you are
How do you talk to an angel
It's like trying to catch a falling star

Bridge:
When you meet a girl that you like a lot
And you fall in love but she loves you not
If a flame should start as you hold her near
Better keep your heart outta danger my dear

Chorus:
How do you talk to an angel
How do you hold her close to where you are
How do you talk to an angel
It's like trying to catch a falling star

We're looking at the same old moon  
And the same old sky  
We're looking for the same old thing  
And I try I try  

You say that you've been wrong before  
You played the fool  
And I thought about it  
But I don't agree  
I think you're cool  

Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We both know we've been here before  
We both know what can happen  

Hold on my heart  
'Cause I'm looking over your shoulder  
Ooh please don't rush in this time  
Don't show her how you feel  

Hold on my heart  
Throw me a lifeline  
I'll keep a-hold of you  
Hold on my heart  
You've got me dreaming  
Of a good life and a true love  

And I know that you're feeling the same way too  
Hold on now hold on now  
Though it's getting harder every day  
Just hold on to that feeling  
And don't let it slip away  

May be your own life's love  
Will depend on the strength of your will  
Just stay with me baby  
I'm afraid of you  

Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We both know we've been here before  
We both know what can happen  

So hold on my heart  
Throw me a lifeline  
I'll keep a-hold of you  
Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We'll find a way to keep this love  
Alive every night and day  

Hold on my heart  
Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
And don't let it go  

Hold on my heart  
Hold on my heart  
And don't let it go  
Hold on my heart
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
There's Something I Have To Say To You

Don't Hide Our Love

Repeat With Ad Libs
Verse One:
See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kicks up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype see
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was procreating
I says "excuse me miss but yo' I don't know your name"
But she felt I was handy and said "I'll explain"
Ahh you married to the Ave I see
And your husband's name is Gary
"Yeah" Or was it Larry
I pick up the conversation 'cause we can relate see
Cause I'm feelin' the same way she's feelin'
Marry if we both were single
We could do what we feel like doing
And get lifted uh huh
Chorus:
People everyday y'all can you hear me
People everyday we be rappin' on the freeway
People everyday ya marquer
People everyday hey hey hey
Verse Two:
Back on the scene crispy and clean
You can try but then why cause you can't intervene
We be the outcasts down for the settle
Won't play rock paper scissors can't you see we're petal to the metal
The pistol is pointed at the jock he frost like a popsicle
Try to critique our motives why you made a mistake
Never bargained for the hype and chill factors
Way back in 1986 I simply cleaned a lot
The pool was in the vibe well times were lean
By the time the vibe was right it was 1994
So come now do you wanna get some more
Chorus:
People everyday y'all can you hear me
People everyday we be rappin' on the freeway
People everyday oui everyday
People everyday hey hey hey
Verse Three:
Now just the other day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cos it was crazy hot
I walked past this dude who was rocking a suit
I said "a suit in this heat well that's just crazy suit"
He replied "true" I said "nah why"
People been wearing less and going out at night
Ha ha damn I'm just messing with you
Or maybe not cos I'm sure there's some of y'all who feel like I do
Well well well oh what do you know
It's the Dipdy Dipdy Diggy yo here we go
So wave your hands way up in the air
And party over here party over there
Wave your hands wave 'em like you just don't care come on
People everybody everywhere come on
Chorus:
People everyday y'all can you hear me
People everyday we be rappin' on the freeway
People everyday oui everyday
People Everyday hey hey hey
Here we go c'mon…
You can keep your hat on it's a lovely day
Throw your worries to the wind and watch them fly away
Drinking champagne on a boat
And the girls are all in bikinis
Everybody's had enough to smoke
And I can still hear the music I can hear the music

I'll be home soon that's what you said to me
I'm waiting by the phone and I'm feeling so alone
But you're out there having fun
With all the girls around you
How could you do this to our love
How could you do this to our love

No son of mine
No son of mine
You're no son of mine

When I met your mother she was just a girl
But now she's my whole world and I won't let her go
I've tried to raise you right but you've grown up wrong
And there's nothing I can do to make you come home

No son of mine
No son of mine
You're no son of mine

You don't understand you're just a boy
And one day you'll regret the things you've done
I feel so helpless I feel so sad
And all the memories we had are just fading away

No son of mine
No son of mine
You're no son of mine
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Wildside" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch:


I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you'll wait around awhile
I'll make you fall for me
I promise I promise you I will


People always tryin' to find the black sheep
They wanna diss me dismiss me
They wanna 'cause a riff between the crew and me
But they don't know that I am really kinda friendly
See just want to give a pound to the ones who backed me
My fans the Funky Bunch my posse
But the ones who try to diss they come up empty
So if I ever see you you better act friendly


Take a walk on the wild side
Let me take you on a ride
We'll take a walk on the wild side
I say hey you you wanna come and slide


People call me smooth some call me ruthless
Good times bad times I'm always in the truthless
But there's always somebody tryin' to accuse me
Take me to court they wanna use and abuse me
But they don't know that I am really kinda groovy
There's no need for talking anymore let's just do me
I got the kickin' back calm and kinda movie
So if you try to see me you better do it truly


Take a walk on the wild side
Let me take you on a ride
We'll take a walk on the wild side
I say hey you you wanna come and slide




Take a walk on the wild side
Let me take you on a ride
We'll take a walk on the wild side
I say hey you you wanna come and slide


I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you'll wait around awhile
I'll make you fall for me
I promise I promise you I will
Sometimes words are hard to find  
I'm looking for that perfect line  
To let you know you're always on my mind  
Yeah this is love - n' I've learned enough to know  
I'm never lettin' go  
No no no - I ain't letting go  

When I look into your eyes - I know I've found  
The mirror of my own soul  
Don't need to be no stranger -  
'Cause I am welcome here  
Right here where I belong  

CHORUS:  
Do I have to say the words  
Do I have to tell the truth  
Do I have to shout it out  
Do I have to say a prayer  
Must I prove to you how good we are together  
Do I have to say the words  

Somewhere in my heart I'm always  
Dancing with you in the summer rain  
Doesn't matter what I do now  
Doesn't matter what I say  

Somethings will never change  

It's how I feel  
Some things will never change  
That's how it is  

When I look into your eyes - I know I've found  
The mirror of my own soul  
Don't need to be no stranger -  
'Cause I am welcome here  
Right here where I belong  

REPEAT CHORUS  

Do I have to say it  
Do I have to say it  
Do I have to say it      

REPEAT CHORUS

Love is forever - as I lie awake
Beside you
Love is forever - as I write this song
For you
Love is forever - as I know I'll
Never doubt you
Love is forever - as I feel your
Heart beat next to mine

Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Ahh ah ah ah ah

Love is forever - and we'll
Die together
Love is forever - we'll rise
Again when we fall
Love is forever - and we'll
Die together
Love is forever - love is for
Hearts not faces at all

Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Ahh ah ah ah ah

We'll take the night - and
Hold it hold it tight
And never let it go
One thing I'm sure of - is
The way we make love
And the way that it grows

And I know I've found it
In the nick of time
It's alright alright
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Ahh ah ah ah ah

Love is forever - as I lie awake
Beside you
Love is forever - as I know there's only you

Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy


There's a message in the wire and I'm sendin' you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losin' this fight
In your world I have no meaning though I'm tryin' hard
To understand
And it's my heart that's breakin' down this long distance line tonight


Baby 'cause I'm missing you now

I'm missing you now

Verse 1:
I stepped through the door I said it before
I'm the king of the room and I'm hardcore
But I'm leavin' that up to your own interpretation
And maybe even demonstration
But I'mma let the rhythm make love to your eardrum
Who the hell said I couldn't come I'm fearless
When I hear this I put it in gear and disappear
It's clear that you can't get near this
So sit on the sidelines and sip on a lime
The rhymes I create devastate
So keep it or sweep it or save it for later
But for now just bump that back to the hotel

Verse 2:
I hit the sheets and go to sleep when I'm tired
And wake up re-inspired ready to start a new day
But when I'm on vacation other niggas start to play
So what the hell am I supposed to do
I gotta get back to the hotel
So I can get some peace of mind and keep my mind on my rhymes
And rock the microphone for the end of time
It's all work and no play
That's why I'm here to say
This is dedicated to the people who groove
To the bass in their Lexus Jeeps or Regals
No discrimination for this organization
So let's get together and take a vacation

Outro:
Let's go back to the hotel what Back to the hotel
Back to the hotel what Back to the hotel
Let's go back to the hotel what Back to the hotel
Back to the hotel what Back to the hotel
When I look into your eyes
I see forever when I look in your eyes
You're all I ever wanted
I always want you to be mine
Let's make a promise till the end of time
We'll always be together
And our love will never die
So here we are face to face
And heart to heart
I want you to know we will
Never be apart
Now I believe that wishes can come true
'Cause I see my whole world
I see only you
When I look into your eyes
I can see how much I love you
And it makes me realize
When I look into your eyes
I see all my dreams come true
When I look into your eyes
I've looked for you all of my life
Now that I've found you
We will never say goodbye
I can't stop this feeling
There's nothing I can do
'Cause I see everything
When I look at you

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Uhh Ahh" by Boyz II Men:

Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh

I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control

And I don't want to explain tonight
Why I'm feeling so high I just want to fly

Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh

Ooh he wants me to come and play
But I've got to say
"I'm sorry baby not tonight"

I don't want to be bad
But I might
Just get a little crazy
That's alright

This feeling's taking over me
I'm not exactly sure what it is

Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh

Ooh he's got me saying
Uhh ahh
Ooh he's got me saying
Uhh ahh

I can't help but stare at his package in his pants
The way he's posing let's me know that- in advance
The romance is heavy it's cool and steady
Ready for the ultimate loving that was ever ready

Ooh baby go slow life a rodeo
Baby kick like a rocket in slow mo
Cause nothing's quite as nice as being loves unconscious
Cause nothing's quite as nice as being loves unconscious

Uhh ahh
Ooh he's got me saying
Uhh ahh
Ooh he's got me saying

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Thinkin' Back" by Color Me Badd:


Don't feel bad we all have a time when we had to go through it
Just thinking back


I remember when I first met her
I never thought I'd ever sweat her
I was cleverer I guess
Back then I was no lover
She took me home I barely knew her
We had a smoke good conversation
But it was getting late
I said my goodbye's I was on my way
It was nice to know ya that's what I said
Today I'm steady kicking myself in the head
But I was young and dumb


I was brought up with the old ways
Be the man make the money show the woman no praise
But I was seeing things in a new light
And decided to do what was right
I bought some flowers a nice bottle of wine
She looked at me and said "You're so kind"
I had her laughing us dancing
I didn't want the night to end
I gave her a kiss but I didn't expect to never see her again
But I was young and dumb


I remember when she called me
After Bryan and MJG
She asked me out to the cinema
But with me things were going either way
It was a joke a dare from a friend
But she called me first I was in
We were holding hands at the end of the night
I could see it in her eyes she wanted me to stay
I made an excuse I really had to run
But I was young and dumb


Thinking back I don't know what I was thinking
Thinking back I was young and dumb
Thinking back I don't know what I was thinking
Thinking back I was young and dumb


Thinking back I don't know what I was thinking
Thinking back I was young and dumb
Thinking back I don't know what I was thinking
Thinking back I was young and dumb


Thinking back I don't know what I was thinking
Thinking back I was young and dumb
Thinking back I don't know what I was thinking
Thinking back I was young and dumb

Would I lie to you
Would I lie to you
Would I lie to you
Yeah
Oh-somebody
Would I lie to you


Look into my eyes can't you see they're open wide
Would I lie to you baby would I lie to you Oh yeah
Don't you know it's true
Girl there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you baby yeah


Would I lie to you
Would I lie to you
Oh yeah

Look at me what am I supposed to do
Take it from me I'd be lost without you
Would I lie to you baby yeah
Cause this is not some kind of game
Baby baby baby baby the love we had
You know it ain't the same


Would I lie to you

Verse 1:
I could say what I wanna say
I could play what I wanna play
No one tellin' me how to behave
And no one knows the way I'm feelin'
No one to say what I ought to do
No one to lean on I'm dependin' on you
And I know there might be times
When you'll wish you could walk away

But you're not the kind to give up on someone
And that's why I keep comin' back

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Just Take My Heart" by Mr Big:

It's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping
I can't imagine living my life after you're gone
Wondering why so many questions have no answers
I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong

Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye
Just take my heart when you go

I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you but you're hard to ignore
Just take my heart when you go

Here we are about to take the final step now
I just can't fool myself I know there's no turning back
Face to face it's been endless conversation
But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk

I'd give my everything to you
Follow you to the limit
Wherever you go I'll be with you

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you but you're hard to ignore
Just take my heart when you go

Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
If this is goodbye
Just take my heart when you go

I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you but you're hard to ignore
Just take my heart when you go

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you but you're hard to ignore
Just take my heart when you go
I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Remember the good times
That we had
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me I wanna be the one

I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside but we can't be heard

But I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you but more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness deep and endless night
Gave me everything you had oh you gave me light

And I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

And I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
Weep not for the memories
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked

I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Drivin' with my baby to get her in the mood
She's dialin'' through my radio and I'm ready to make my move
But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove

It was Chopin Mozart Beethoven
It makes me wanna scream
Bach Tchaikovsky violins
Turn it off that ain't my scene

Well I'm sorry girl here's the real me
You wanna rock or you wanna leave
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude

I got an old Fender Strat and I plugged it into thin air
I pulled the volume to 10 and I don't know where I am
I think I need a doctor 'cause I'm getting' crazed
I know I'm dangerous but I don't know what to change

Well you got the potion to get it right
The emotion that you feel inside
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked

I'm astonished a foolish man
Blinded by the neon lights
Don't understand it but it sure feels right
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked

Ooh yeah
Verse One:
Mic checka swingin sword lecture
Closing down the sector supreme neck protector
Better warn em kid Mr Mecc'll bump
Nowadays n***as talkin' but ain't sayin' nothin'
So my dons hold the fort hold the fort
While I wreck shit like a sick runaway train
I'm the M-train there's no thing that I won't bang
Heads up 'cause I'm droppin' somethin'
No fronts no tricks no soap box speeches
Just foul runnin' vomit through the tube punk tick-tock
It's Das EFX if you don't know you'd better find out
Ayo wassup now you know oops upside your head
Do you wanna go for a blow by blow a creep show a peep show
Do you wanna Xscape now oh no you can't do that nobody can
Do me no favor do yourself a favor
Don't ever let me hear you say they're better than me
Never could you fatter than me
Let's get together what for better funky hit-makers
Spread the word it's the crew in the neighborhood
Doing anything that we wanna do
But for now jack let's start this party off right

Verse Two:
You know my steez there's no other kings in this rap thing
Sobrang baba kaya pwede nang lakarin
It's quite amazing how we got this far without guns and drug cases
Mean mugs and mug shots just shake my dreadlocks
With the bass and treble ah I'm on a level
So devils dance the rebel think harder it's logical
How we underground kings chronicle
Thieves couldn't steal this I'm penning till I'm ending
Poverty's no longer offending
I'm pouring flava with the help of my sqwad
We dipped in chocolate now it's time to get off
We run the gamut outrageous escapades
From the eighties home of the heartless shade
The cycle continues
As I swing this like Tonto
I'll be counting the mad rhymes in my notebook pronto 

Outro:
Any emcee that disagree disagree
Well I don't give a uh so you know
Step to Das if you're feeling kinda froggy then leap
Buck-buck-buck like a shotgun blast we dashin'
Speakin' of pullin' triggers you're facin'
The hollow-point of the real hardcore rap slingers
The EFX'll swarm and pour into your speaker
Won't the EFX just shine off your skull like sneakers
So Walk This Way cause talk is cheap kid
You're never ever gonna get near my fear sit near and hear
What we have in store and oh my
Nevertheless you gotta get mine to get yours
I say peace to the crews that pump and go
And peace to all heads that's never been popped a dose
Cause power is the truth and the truth is power
We ride off in EFX hour
Turn down the lights turn down the bed  
Turn down these voices inside my head  
Lay down with me tell me no lies  
Just hold me close don't patronize  
Don't patronize me  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something it won't  
Here in the dark in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power  
But you won't no you won't  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
I'll close my eyes then I won't see  
The love you don't feel when you're holding me  
Morning will come and I'll do what's right  
Just give me till then to give up this fight  
And I will give up this fight  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something it won't  
Here in the dark in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power  
But you won't no you won't  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
Ain't no use in you trying  
It's no good for me baby without love  
All my tears all these years everything I believed in  
Baby oh yeah  
Someone's gonna love me  
You've got to lay down your heart  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something it won't  
And here in the dark in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power  
But you won't no you won't  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
If you don't
Ooh La La La La
Ooh La La La La

Verse 1:
Sitting in my class just drifting away
Staring into the windows of the world
Yeah I can't hear the teacher his books don't call me at all ah
I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play
'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile

Verse 2:
The clock at work says three it feels like six
And that's onl-y half past time to play
Th-th-ree unlock the door and get my feet on the floor
'Cause I can't wait to see you so I can go and say
I love your smile
I love your smile

Chorus:
La La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La

Verse 3:
The vibe I feel is real real
and I'm thankful every day every day yeah
I found a woman like you
oh my world is finally okay yeah
'Cause hearts are meant to be broken broken
But then we ne-ver lose hope
That's why I say more than you'll ever know ever know 
I love your smile
I love your smile

Chorus

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain


We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain oo yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away


If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain


Do you need some timeon your own
Do you need some timeall alone
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some timeall alone


I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you


Sometimes I need some time
On my own
Sometimes I need some time
All alone
Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't you know you need some time
All alone


And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain oh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain


Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Verse 1:
It's time to face reality
The fact you're not here with me
It's seems like dreams but it's not reality
Feels like I'm living a fantasy

Chorus:
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Verse 2:
Meeting Mr Right the man of my dreams
The one who shows me true love or at least it seems
With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me that gentle loving stare

Chorus:
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Bridge:
It seems so unbelievable and I can't help but give in
Cos' what if Mr Right now turns into Mr Wrong
It's always a chance we take when we try to find somebody

Chorus:
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Outro:
Finally Finally oh yeah yeah
Finally Finally oh yeah yeah
I can fulfill your request but please note that the lyrics contain mature themes and language:

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find oh the right romantic line
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have oh they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me
Verse 1:
You can be anything you wanna be
Don't let negativity take you from me
Can't nobody say what you can't do
Cause' you know and I know it's true

Chorus:
You just live and learn and then baby you're on
Love is all we got so we gotta keep on
Live and learn and then baby you'll see
That doing it for yourself will set you free

Verse 2:
I can see that somebody's watching you
And everybody wants to be like you
Being who you are can only take you far
And I know you'll go far being who you are

Chorus:
You just live and learn and then baby you're on
Love is all we got so we gotta keep on
Live and learn and then baby you'll see
That doing it for yourself will set you free

Bridge:
Sometimes it's hard on yourself
But know that you'll make it through
It's all about what you do yeah

Chorus:
You just live and learn and then baby you're on

That's easy here are the uncensored lyrics of "Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover" by Sophie B Hawkins: 

That old dog has chained you up all right
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero
Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Open up on the inside gonna fill you up gonna make you cry
This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
Give me a week or two to dedicate my world to you
I'll be your lover I'll be your warrior
I'll be your angel I'll be your spirit
I'll be your lover I'll be your one
Only soul I'll be your warrior

In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me

When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more
Stay with me

You'd better hope and pray
That you make it safe
Back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you'll wake one day
In your own world
'Cause when you sleep at night
They don't hear your cries
In your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell
Back in your own world

Chorus:
In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in-between
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more
Stay with me
Stay with me

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "She's Playing Hard to Get" by Hi-Five:

[Straight up she's really fine
Staying that she's always mine yeah all mine
Nah I can't afford to be wasting time
Straight up she's got that attitude
Saying "I don't need you but I know I do"
Feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind

She's playing hard to get

She's playing hard to get
She's playing hard to get
She's playing hard to get]

Now she's led me to her doorstep
Saying she can't take it no more
I thought she'd never ever let me in
But now it seems I've got a chance



What am I supposed to do Oh yeah
I'm wrapped around her finger but I don't know what to do
Cause all I really want is to be with you Oh yeah
Tell me what am I supposed to do



She's playing hard to get
She's playing hard to get
She's playing hard to get
She's playing hard to get]

Nothing's so loud
As hearing when we lie
Truth is not kind
And you've said neither am I


And the air outside so soft is saying everything
Everything


All I want is to feel this way
To be this close to feel the same


And the sky is grey
And the sand is grey
And the ocean is grey
And I feel right at home in this stunning monochrome
Alone in my way


I smoke and I drink
And every time I blink
I have a tiny dream
But as bad as I am
I'm proud of the fact
That I'm worse than I seem


And the dirt beneath me
The coldness of the sea
The silence in between
All the sights unseen
It might be easier
If I wasn't trying to be so quiet now
I'll be exactly what you want me to be
Oh you're too funky for me
I gotta get inside of you And I'll show you heaven if you let me
I'm just so too funky for you
I gotta get inside I gotta get inside I gotta get inside of your love
I'm too funky for you Oh what a night no inhibitions
Caught in the headlights stopped at my feet I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time I'm taken past the point of no return
Wage your war stab me in the back it's easier that way
The lines drawn were all getting fat and the poor are getting poorer now
And every day we sit and ask ourselves "Who is it gonna be today"
And who is gonna take away all the little people living out the lie that you sold them
Tell me
Are you too funky for me Oh what a night no inhibitions
Caught in the headlights stopped at my feet I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time
Cause I'm a voodoo child Lord knows I'm a voodoo child
I'm too funky for you Oh what a night no inhibitions
Caught in the headlights stopped at my feet I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns But I fear not the time
Cause I'm a voodoo child Lord knows I'm a voodoo child

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate

Tuesday Wednesday stay in bed
Oh Thursday watch the walls instead

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

A few excerpts from the uncensored lyrics of "Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad" by Def Leppard are:

"Here I am I'm in the wrong bed again  
It's just a game I just can't win  
There you are breathin' soft on my skin  
Still you won't let me in  
So come on  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  

Have you ever needed someone so bad yeah  
Have you ever wanted someone you just couldn't have  
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart  
Have you ever needed someone so bad  

I was the one who'd reach for you  
I was the one who'd always laugh  
But with you I'm just a shadow  
Love's the reason you're to blame  

So come on  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  

Have you ever needed someone so bad yeah  
Have you ever wanted someone you just couldn't have  
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart  
Have you ever needed someone so bad  

Don't lie to me baby  
We go - like a hurricane  
Slowly drift -in slow-mo  
A sea of lovers with no-where to go  

So come on  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  

Have you ever needed someone so bad yeah  
Have you ever wanted someone you just couldn't have  
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart  
Have you ever needed someone so bad"
You got it

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Take This Heart" by Richard Marx:


Take this heart
And make it stronger
Cause I would die for
you
Whatever you want me to


As I open up my eyes
Every feeling comes alive
And I wonder if you know
How it feels to let you go


Cause you don't see me like I do
There's no other way to say I'm in love with you


Take this heart
And make it stronger
Cause I would die for you
Whatever you want me to


And I know it might sound crazy
But every time I see you baby
My heart tells me to stay
Not to ever walk away


Cause you don't see me like I do
There's no other way to say I'm in love with you


Take this heart
And make it stronger
Cause I would die for you
Whatever you want me to


Take this heart
And make it a part
Of everything you are
No matter near or far
Verse 1:
Every now and then wanna be your only friend
Tired of being situations only ends in "caught up"
So we deliberately change our conversation
'Cause everything ain't what it seems and hangin' out can be dangerous
If you're with me know that I'm a friend for life
We're all just living day to day ain't got no time to waste
I won't dwell on something that won't help me grow
Who's there for me when the world says no

Chorus:
What about your friends Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again What about your friends
Are they gonna be low down Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you

Verse 2:
Stick together like sand and stone
This is the only way to stay strong
You gotta cherish the ties that bind
You're not just friends you're two of a kind
So don't get mad when my eyes can see
Don't get sad when you envy me
Succeed as we believe in soul
Ain't nothing going on but the rent
Yeah you got a place to live but you got to pay rent

Chorus:
What about your friends Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again What about your friends
Are they gonna be low down Will they ever be around

Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics of "That's What Love Is For" by Amy Grant:

Sometimes we make it harder than it is
We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way
What we had is gone and gone away

But love is always right there
To remind us that nothing else matters
Love is our connection
To the power of the universe

That's what love that's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love that's what love is for
Nothing else can do it

Sometimes we are at odds with the world
With ourselves and with life
When we take a pause
We'll realize all we need is love
Cause love it takes the pressure off
Cause love it sets our hearts a notch above

That's what love that's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love that's what love is for
Nothing else can do it

That's what love is for
That's what love is for
That's what love is for
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "We Got a Love Thang" by CeCe Peniston:

Verse 1:
It's Friday night
And I feel all right
The party is here on the west side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say "Monty yo we made it"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All pumped up and I'm feeling right
Riding my bike and my all of my homies got Eddied
Strictly got brew when I'm not beatin' concrete
It's like this and like that and yeah it's like that
The neighborhood's so great
And everybody's celebrate

Chorus:
We got a love thang
And it's a family affair
We got a love thang
And it's floating in the air

Verse 2:
I see a light and I hear a voice
It's my neighbor next door
Says "you're making too much noise"
The people across the street yell "you gotta rock the beat"
"Well dammit that's the point" said Rockin' Sidney
The girl across the hall said "I got the music pon"
You can play it all you want
It's just got to be the jam" and damn right
It is the jam
So we gotta keep it strong
If a mobbie scout come in it's on
And poppin' just like a fat balloon
I'm gonna be around family
Always and forever I'll be here
Sticking with you
Everything is gonna be all right
Let the music take control
Find a groove and let yourself go

Chorus:
We got a love thang
And it's a family affair
We got a love thang
And it's floating in the air

Verse 1:
Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going

Pre-Chorus:
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held onto my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

Chorus:
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
It's gonna be alright
Make it happen

Verse 2:
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you

Pre-Chorus:
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow

Chorus:
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
It's gonna be alright
Make it happen

Bridge:
If you believe in yourself
You're gonna have others believe in you
You'll see that nothing is impossible
If you believe

Chorus:
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
It's gonna be alright
Make it happen

Outro:
Make it happen make it happen make it happen fade out
My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven  
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes  
That boy's not right three years ago when I came to know Mary  
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies

And saw the man inside  
We used to walk down by the river  
She loved to watch the sun go down  
We used to walk along the river  
And dream our way out of this town  
No one understood what I felt for Mary  
No one cared until the night she went out walking alone  
And never came home  
Man with a badge came knocking next morning  
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly  
Pointed right at me  
I swear I didn't do it  
I swear I didn't do it  
I swear I didn't do it  
I swear I didn't do it  

Mary cried and wept  
As I was taken under  
And I was always guilty in the eyes of town people  
She came to see me in the jailhouse  
Just before they caught me to go  
Never touched her; never held her  
I think it was her love for me that drove her to see  
Inside the heart of me  
And help to keep me free  
One thing led to another  
We were married in a less than a year  
Moved into a house on the South side of town  
With a yard big enough for the children  
Carole Diane was born in '62  
A beautiful child from a brand new world  
Her eyes were like the sky  
I saw her standing in the light  
She had a way about her  
I could not understand  
But I knew I loved her  
The next few years were the saddest in my life  
I called it empty living  
Years without their smile  
When Carole Diane contracted polio  
My Mary cried  
Oh God  
It was the first time I'd questioned His existence     
Is there a Heaven; is there a Hell  
Where does our soul go  
Did it disappear like my child's smile  
Or will it go to some distant land  
Come back to me  
And help me understand  

Help me understand  

She was born the day  
That the Churchills' dog died  
She always joked and said  
That he left in her to fill his hole  
It wasn't long until I knew  
That Mary was pregnant again  
By the time that I was out of jail  
The final words had been penned  
A garbled postmarked letter  
Wild suggestions of foul play  
I tore all of our world apart  
All just to call out her name  
Mary oh Mary  

There's a big old lonely house  
Just south of the town  
And a man strapped to a chair  
With fear in his eyes  
Who could've told her  
That we're going down  
This time  
There'll be no one to save  
With the world as our witness  
Damn you I never stood a chance  
My heart is in your hands  
Mary wherever you are  
I only want to haunt you  
My heart is in your hands  
And I only want to haunt you

I took my baby
On a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle
Has happened tonight

Chorus:
But if you're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message 
In the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
And it's true
Either you're wrong
Or you're right

But if you're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Girl when the goin' gets mean

Verse 2:
Protection
For gangs clubs
And nations
Causing grief in
Human relations
It's a turf war
On a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides
Of the tale

See it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood
Comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright
Get duller
I'm not going to spend
My life being a color

Chorus:
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Bridge:

Being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of
Being my brother
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

Yea yea yea now
Ooh ooh
Yea yea yea now

To get by
It's black it's white ooh
