Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now I close my eyes and dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Yeah it must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away


Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you


It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong


But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said "Girl you better try to have fun no matter what you do"
But he's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you


All the flowers that you planted mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try


Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

I could hardly believe it  
When I heard the news today  
I had to come and get it straight from you  
They said you were leavin' someone's swept your heart away  
From the look upon your face I see it's true  
So tell me all about it tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'  
Then tell me one thing more before I go  
Now that I've been lovin' you so long  
How am I supposed to live without you  
And how am I supposed to carry on  
When all that I've been livin' for is gone  
I didn't come here for cryin' didn't come here to breakdown  
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end  
And how can I blame you when I build my world around  
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends  
And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreamin'  
Now that your dream has come true  
Tell me how am I supposed to live without you  
And how am I supposed to carry on  
When all that I've been livin' for is gone  
Ooh I'm young but I'm wise enough to know  
That you don't fall in love overnight  
That's why I thought if I took my time  
That everything in love would be right  
But as soon as I close my eyes  
I was sayin' to love  
Goodbye  
Didn't want to believe it  
But I had to face the truth  
That when your heart's not open  
There's a hell you're gonna lose  
So I have learned the meaning of  
What love's supposed to do  
And hey how am I supposed to live without you  
Now that I've been lovin' you so long  
How am I supposed to live without you  
And how am I supposed to carry on  
When all that I've been livin' for all that I've been  
Giving for is gone  
Without you  
How am I supposed to live  
Without you  
How am I supposed to live  
Without you

As you requested here are the uncensored lyrics of "Escapade" by Janet Jackson:

As I was walkin' by
Saw you standin' there
With a smile looked in your eyes
And my heart started skippin' beats
I stood there so mesmerized
And I really couldn't believe my eyes
I knew I had to have you for my own

I didn't wanna take too long
'Cause I knew that you were shy
And I didn't wanna pass you by
So I tried to play it cool
But my heart was jumpin' I was actin' like a fool
I knew I had to have you for my own

Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade leave your worries behind
Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade come on and take a ride with me

I didn't know what I was gettin' into
So I just let it go
But it's funny how you can sometimes
Just lose control
So I just had to let you know
That I had this feelin' deep inside
That you would be the one for me

Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade leave your worries behind
Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade come on and take a ride with me

My mind was racin' I was pacin'
But I knew what I had to do
I made a beeline for the door
And I don't want to take no more
What happened to the beat flock of sheep
And all creation go
I guess I'll never know

Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade leave your worries behind
Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade come on and take a ride with me

Come on let's take a trip
There's a party over there that ain't no place to stay
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a dirty old beat
Nothin' wrong with dancin' baby nothin' wrong with freakin'
Ah we're escapin' to the other side
Escapade we're gonna have a good time

Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade leave your worries behind
Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade come on and take a ride with me

Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade leave your worries behind
Escapade we're gonna have a good time
Escapade come on and take a ride with me
It was a rainy night when
He came into sight
Standing by the road with no umbrella
No coat
So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for the night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will
You want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to
So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me
So many times easily
And in the morning when he woke all
I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden we planted a tree
Don't try to find me please don't you dare
Just live in my memory you'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to
Oh oooh we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes
I said please please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me
Was the one little thing that you can

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will you want me too
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
All I wanna do all I wanna do
All I wanna do all I wanna do
All I wanna do is make love to you
All night long
All night long

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

The boy could sing knew how to move everything
Always wanting more he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightning bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
"Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved it was a sin so sweet and true
Always wanting more he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone it happened so soon what could you do

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Release Me" by Wilson Phillips:

I know that it’s time for a change
Mmm but when that change comes
Will you still feel the same
How many times have I tried to turn this love around
But every time you just let me down

And we’ll be saying goodbye
To everything we had
We’ll be saying goodbye
But can we still be friends
Can't we still be friends
Does it have to end

And we’ll be saying goodbye
To everything we had
We’ll be saying goodbye
But can we still be friends
Can't we still be friends
Does it have to end

I know that it’s time for a change
Mmm but when that change comes
Will you still feel the same
How many times have I tried to turn this love around
But every time you just let me down

And we’ll be saying goodbye
To everything we had
We’ll be saying goodbye
But can we still be friends
Can't we still be friends
Does it have to end

And we’ll be saying goodbye
To everything we had
We’ll be saying goodbye
But can we still be friends
Can't we still be friends
Does it have to end

Release me
Release my body
I know it's wrong
So why am I with you now
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to
Convince myself
That I'm better off without you
Look at this face
I know the years are showing
Look at this life
I still don't know where it's going

I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

Look at these eyes
They've never seen what mattered
Look at these dreams
So beaten and so battered

I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

So many questions still left unanswered
So much I've never broken through
And when I feel you near me
Sometimes I see so clearly
The only truth I've ever known
Is me and you

Look at this man
So blessed with inspiration
Look at this soul
Still searching for salvation

I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

Can't Live Without Your Love and Affection by Nelson uncensored lyrics:

I always thought that heartache was a deal
That you had to go through it to feel
But this kind of feeling's way too real
It's much too strong to conceal

Chorus:
Can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'cause I can't live without your love

So you play with my heart and you tease me
All that lovin' just came back to me
And it's much too hard to believe
I'm like a leaf in your hand just blowin' away

Chorus

When I'm with you there's no reason to pretend
That I'm someone else and I don't have to hide my tears
Oh oh oh

Chorus

The original lyrics of "Dangerous" by Roxette are:

You pack your bag
You take control
You're moving into my heart
And into my soul
Get out of my way
Get out of my sight
I won't be walking on thin ice
To get through the night

Hey where's your work
What's your game
I know your business
But I don't know your name
Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous

She's got what it takes to make an end
The road is wide but it's slippery
She'll fascinate you but she'll never be mine
It's a matter of time

Hey sugar you know
She's a little bit dangerous

Yeah yeah absolutely stone-faced
I ain't gonna be able to keep this pace
Uh-huhno way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever she's around
She drives me into an endless night
She's a little bit dangerous
And she knows I'm never gonna take her home
She's got what it takes to make me feel alive
We're gonna crash and burn
I'm out of control
Oh oh oh she's a little bit dangerous

Come come cool me down
You've got me spinning like a merry-go-round
Come come lose me now
Or else this heart is gonna explode somehow

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Don't Have the Heart" by James Ingram:

Verse 1:
There was a time
When I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell you
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay

Chorus:
And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

Verse 2:
With a smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty
I'm speechless and I don't know where to start
I Don't know where to start


Bridge:
And I don't want to lose this feeling
And if i could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms



Outro:
Because I see you
In my dreams
Where I'll meet you
Again…again…again

Verse 1:
Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago
All my life I’ve waited
To see your smiling face
Won't you think it over
Come back to my place

Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me
I want you to

Locked up in each other’s' arms
We had all the love we need

I miss the wings of your love
I miss our little dove

Come back to me
I'm beggin' you please
Come back to me

And baby no more lies
No more lies from you to me

No more lies
No more lies from me to you

No more lies from you to me
No more lies
No more lies from me to you
There's nothing else to say

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends  
How can we start over when the fighting never ends baby  
How can we make love if we can't make amends  
How can we be lovers if we can't be can't be friends  

Look at us now look at us baby  
Still tryin' to work it out never get it right  
We must be fools we must be crazy  
Whoa whoa there's no communication  
Whoa whoa it's a no-win situation  
How did we get this far where did we go wrong  
Whoa whoa I don't know how we can carry on  

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends  
How can we start over when the fighting never ends baby  
How can we make love if we can't make amends  
How can we be lovers if we can't be can't be friends  

Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river  
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea  
You lay your bets and then you pay the price  
The things we do for love the things we do for love  

Communication baby is all we need  
We can't go on no no no no no  
We'll just go on -- hurting each other  

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends  
How can we start over when the fighting never ends baby  
How can we make love if we can't make amends  
How can we be lovers if we can't be can't be friends  

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends  
How can we be lovers if we can't be friends

Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics of "Do You Remember" by Phil Collins: 

We never talked about it
But I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time

'Cause I love you but I can't take any more
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
Yes we could try like we tried before
When you kept on telling me those lies

Do you remember
There seemed no way to make up
'Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget

You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go

Do you remember

Through all of my life
In spite of all the pain
You know people are funny sometimes
'Cause they just can't wait
To get hurt again

Do you remember

There are things we wont recall
And feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
'Cause we never seemed to have the time

There was always something more important to do
More important to say
But "I love you" wasn't one of those things
And now it's too late

Do you remember
I'll always remember
'Cause it was late September
And I'd seen you before
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "U Can't Touch This" by MC Hammer:


You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this


My my my my music hi
So hard make me say "Oh my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet


It feels good when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oak town
And I'm known as such and this is a beat uh you can't touch


You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down


Stop Hammer time
Go with the flow it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner


Move slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump
Yeahyou can't touch this


You can't touch this
You can't touch this



You can't touch this


Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that like that
Cold on a mission so fall them back


Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat uh you can't touch


You can't touch this
You can't touch this



Yo I told you you can't touch this
Why you standing there man
You can't touch this
Yo sound the bell school is in sucker
You can't touch this
Give me a song or rhythm
Making 'em sweat that's what I'm giving 'em
Listen to the pads their claps that are jumping
Say you can't touch this


You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this


Break it down


Stop Hammer time
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Just Between You and Me" by Lou Gramm:

Darlin'
I know you're the worryin' kind
When you're unsure
And you can't make up your mind
But believe me
I ain't got no hidden agenda
What you get is what you see
I'm just bein' natural
That's all I'm guilty of
Well I don't want to lead you on
No I would never do you wrong
I'm just between you and me
Baby it's plain to see
That I'm no Casanova
No I'm not a smooth operator
But baby I'll love you right
'Cause honey I'm just your man
Darlin' I know you've been hurt before
But don't you let heartache
Leave you lyin' on the floor
Because baby I could love you
And I'm gonna give you my best
So darlin' don't you look no more
You don't have to travel no further
'Cause I'm just between you and me
Baby it's plain to see
That I'm no Casanova
No I'm not a smooth operator
But baby I'll love you right
'Cause honey I'm just your man
Well I'm not the kind of man
To harbor jealousy or hate
The reason I'm so easy goin'
Is 'cause I ain't hidin' nothin'
But baby I want commitment
And I'm lookin' for the proof
So when you're thinkin' of goin'
Remember what we got
It's just between you and me
Baby it's plain to see
That I'm no Casanova
No I'm not a smooth operator
But baby I'll love you right
'Cause honey I'm just your man

We had a life we had a love
But you don't know what you've got till you lose it
Well that was then and this is now
And I want you back
How many times have I said those words
How many chances I've had to take
But with all the memories that we've shared
I keep on coming back
Explain to me
How it's gonna be
That you're gonna be mine

I keep on hearing you're concerned about my happiness
But all that thought you're giving me is conscience I guess
If I were walking in your shoes I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worrying 'bout me
I'm having lots of fun
Counting flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty-one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothing to do
Verse 1:
Alright
I'm not a prude no
I just want some respect that's right
So close the door if you want me to respond ooh

It's Janet Ms Jackson if you're nasty

I'm a Black Cat and I'm a nothin' but trouble baby
I'm a Black Cat and I'm a nothin' but trouble baby

But I'm a black cat and I'm a really wild most
I'm a Black Cat and I'm a nothin' but trouble baby
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
I'm a Black Cat and I'm a nothin' but trouble baby
But I'm a black cat and I'm a really wild most
Verse 1:
I want to know just what you're feelin'
Is that so wrong now tell me why
I get the feelin' that you're holdin'
Back from me and I don't know why

Chorus:
Can't stop my heart from lovin' you
Can't stop the rain from fallin' down
Can't stop my world from turnin' 'round
Can't stop my heart from lovin' you

The image and the style that ya used to

And my sound's laid down by the underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf

My name is Humpty pronounced with a "Umpty"
Yo ladies oh how I like to hump thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall y'all and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme I like my beats funky
I'm spunky I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick with this Straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl c'mere--are ya ticklish

Ya stare ya glare ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me

All the girls they adore me
Oh yes ladies I'm really bein' sincere
'Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big--uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stupid I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I'll use a word that don't mean nothin' like looptid
I sang on "Doowutchalike" and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said "Just grab 'em in the biscuit"
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well yeah I guess it's obvious I also like to write
All ya had to do is give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "I'll Be Your Shelter" by Taylor Dayne:


If you need somebody
If you want someone you can trust
If you need somebody
To love you tell you no lies
Don't you need somebody
To hold you the way that I do
I'll be that somebody
If you're looking for someone


I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby I'm yours
Be your forever
Or just tonight


Don't you need somebody
To understand you the way that I do
Don't you need somebody
To be with you to tell you the truth
Don't you need somebody
To believe in to be your friend
I'll be that somebody
If you're looking for someone


I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby I'm yours
Be your forever
Or just tonight


And maybe in the morning
I'll be gone who can say
But if you want to be my lover
We can't waste this precious time


I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby I'm yours
Be your forever
Or just tonight

She's a good girl loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl crazy 'bout Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too


It's a long day livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
And I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart


And I'm free free fallin'
Yeah I'm free free fallin'


All the vampires walkin' through the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard
All the bad boys are standin' in the shadows
All the good girls are home with broken hearts


It's a long day livin' in Reseda
There's a freeway runnin' through the yard
And I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart


And I'm free free fallin'
Yeah I'm free free fallin'


I wanna glide down over Mulholland
I wanna write her name in the sky
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while


And I'm free free fallin'
Yeah I'm free free fallin'


Yeah I'm free free fallin'
Oh Free fallin'
Now I'm free fallin'
Oh
Free fallin'
Yeah Free fallin'
Now I'm free fallin'
Oh
Free fallin'
Oh
Free fallin'
Yeah
Free fallin'

I don't need no proof when I'm right  
I don't need nobody to tell me 'bout heaven  
I look at my daughter and I believe  
I don't need no proof when it comes to God and truth  
I can see the sunset and I  sympathize with the rage  
Seeing light at the end of the tunnel  
And I still believe they're all saints but some of them  
Should be canonized  
And I don't need no proof when I'm right  

Nobody else got a hold on me  
I'm my own man I do what I please  
I ain't got nothin' to lose  
But the chains the chains the chains  
So goodbye yellow brick road  
Where the dogs of society howl  
You can't plant me in your penthouse  
I'm going back to my plow  
Back to the howling oh  
I'm gonna be king of wishful thinking  

I'm gonna be king of wishful thinking  
So I will never say never  
I will fight  
I will fight till forever  
Make it right  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up pick it up  
Pick it up pick it up up up  
And never say never  

Goodbye yellow brick road  
Where the dogs of society howl  
You can't plant me in your penthouse  
I'm going back to my plough  
Back to the howling old owl in the woods  
Hunting the horny back toad  
Oh I've finally decided my future lies  
Beyond the yellow brick road  
Oh oh  

So I will never say never  
I will fight  
I will fight till forever  
Make it right  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up pick it up  
Pick it up pick it up up up  
And never say never  

I'm gonna be king of wishful thinking  
I'm gonna be king of wishful thinking  
So I will never say never  
I will fight  
I will fight till forever  
Make it right  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up pick it up  
Pick it up pick it up up up  
And never say never  

I'm gonna be king of wishful thinking  
I'm gonna be king of wishful thinking  
I'm gonna be king of wishful thinking  
I'm gonna be king of wishful thinking

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "What Kind of Man Would I Be" by Chicago:

I'm not the kind of man who'd let you down
Or ever break your heart
And I swear to you darlin' that from now on
I'll be doing my part
But don't go expecting miracles
You've heard all of my lines
All I can say is "I'll do what I can"
And give you all of my time

'Cause you are the one who makes me whole
You've captured my heart and my soul
And though I don't deserve you
I promise I'll never hurt you
What kind of man would I be
If I let you go goodbye
What kind of man would I be
I'd just be lyin' to myself
If I said that I was satisfied
Being treated like somebody else
'Cause you are the only one who knows
The part of me that can't let go
And I just wanna be with you
Until we grow old

What kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
'Cause I don't wanna see

The day that my world falls apart
And I don't wanna hear
The words that come from your heart
Sayin' that you don't love me
'Cause I know that we will be
A symphony
What kind of man would I be
If I had to live without you
What kind of man would I be
I'm just driftin' on a memory
There's no place that I'd rather be
Than with you my love
And I just wanna be with you
Until we grow old

What kind of man would I be
If I let you go goodbye
What kind of man would I be
If I couldn't tell you
What I felt inside
If I didn't realize
There'd be no compromise
Ahh let's hold on to what we've got
And love like we had it all
What kind of man would I be
If I had to live without you
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

Paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew you were there for me

Time after time you were there for me
Remember yesterday walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say I remember you

We spent the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said I love you babe without a sound
I said I'd give my life for your kiss

Time after time you were there for me
Remember yesterday walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say I remember you yeah

Wished we'd never parted said we'd keep in touch
But that was back when love was what we had
Much has changed since then I'll tell you what I've learned
Love that's pure is rarely ever truly planned

Time after time you were there for me
Remember yesterday walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say I remember you oh yeah

Remember yesterday walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand I remember you
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say I remember I remember you yeah

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Here We Are" by Gloria Estefan:

Here we are
Face to face
We forget time and place
Hold me now
Don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know
The time we spend together's gonna fly
And everything you do to me
Is gonna feel so right

Baby when you're loving me
I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
Here we are
All alone
Trembling hearts beating strong
Reaching out a breathless kiss
I never thought could feel like this
I want to stop the time from passing by
I want to close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me
I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do aout it

'Cause this is this is the night
And feeling's right
Oh my love
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do
Is to share my life with you

Baby when you're loving me
I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you

Here we are
Face to face
We forget time and place
Hold me now
Don't let go
Though it hurts us both to know
You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it
What is it
It's it
What is it
It's it
It's gone
But you don't need it anyway
You just smile and you're on your way
Cause your boss is DMCA
It's in your face but you can't grab it
What is it
It's it
What is it
It's it
It's gone
But you don't need it anyway
You're so self-satisfied
That you don't see what you've done
But you'd try to take us all
If you could take this moment
Right now is all it meant
Whoa
It's in your face but you can't grab it
What is it
It's it
What is it
It's it
It's gone
But you don't need it anyway
It's in your face but you can't grab it
What is it
It's it
What is it
It's it
It's gone
But you don't need it
Get down with the victims
You both know you
Need them
You're stuck in the middle
Of all their relevance
And their illegitimate cry
And you stare at your reflection
And you don't like what you see
In order to get to the top
You better start climbing
Cause your boss is DMCA
It's in your face but you can't grab it
What is it
It's it
What is it
It's it
It's gone
But you don't need it anyway
Go ahead and hate your neighbor
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
You can justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Come the judgment day
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away
It's in your face but you can't grab it
What is it
It's it
What is it
It's it
It's gone
But you don't need it anyway
It's in your face but you can't grab it
What is it
It's it
What is it
It's it
It's gone
But you don't need it

And this love of mine

There are a few explicit words and phrases in the lyrics of "What It Takes" by Aerosmith but I will provide you with the uncensored version as requested:

There goes my old girlfriend there's another diamond ring  
And uh all those late-night promises I guess they don't mean a thing  
So baby what's the story Did you find another man   
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made  
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away

I used to feel your fire but now it's cold inside  
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat yeah  
Tell me what it takes to let you go  
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go  
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night  
Without thinking you lost everything that was good in your life  
To the toss of the dice ah yeah  
Oh tell me what it takes to let you go  
Yeah girl before I met you I was FINE – fine  
But your love made me a prisoner yeah my heart's been doing time  
You spent me up like money then you hung me out to dry  
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise  
Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

I used to feel your fire but now it's cold inside  
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat yeah  
Tell me what it takes to let you go  
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go  
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night  
Without thinking you lost everything that was good in your life  
To the toss of the dice ah yeah  
Oh tell me what it takes to let you go

Without you I live it up a little more every day  
Without you I'm seein' myself so differently  
I didn't wanna believe it then but it all worked out in the end  
When I watched you walk away  
Well I never thought I'd say  
I'm fine

Tell me what it takes to let you go  
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go  
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night  
Without thinking you lost everything that was good in your life  
To the toss of the dice ah yeah  
Tell me what it takes to let you go  
Tell me how much more the price is  
To pay for my mistakes  
Yeah I'm gonna play with fire but I'm tired of being burned  
I'm gonna leave on heartache city  
Cause I'm done with the blues  
Done with the crying the living the lies and the dying  
Tell me what it takes to let you go  
Tell me why  
I should set you free  
I don't wanna be your prisoner  
But do you wanna be my wife

Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date  
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait  
Let me tell you a story of my situation  
I was talkin' to this girl from the US nation  
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert  
She had long hair and a short miniskirt  
I just got onstage drippin' pourin' with sweat  
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met  
I whispered in her ear "Come to the picture booth  
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are 100 proof"  
I asked her her name she said blah-blah-blah  
She had nine ten-pants and a very big bra  
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused  
I said "How do you like the show" she said "I was very amused"  
I started throwin' bass she started throwin' back mid-range  
But when I sprung the question she acted kind of strange  
Then when I asked "Do ya have a man"  
She tried to pretend she said "No I don't I only have a friend"  
Come on I'm not even goin' for it  
This is what I'm goin' to sing  
You you got what I need but you say he's just a friend  
And you say he's just a friend oh baby  
You you got what I need but you say he's just a friend  
But you say he's just a friend oh baby  
You got what I need but you say he's just a friend  
But you say he's just a friend  
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time  
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime  
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact  
Like Agnes Agatha Germaine and Jack  
Forget about that let's go into the story  
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me  
So we started talkin' getttin' familiar  
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up  
A relationship or some understanding  
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'  
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet  
I had no idea I was in for a treat  
After this was established everything was cool  
The tour was over she went back to school  
I called every day to see how she was doin'  
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'  
I called her room; a guy picked up; and then I called again  
I say "Yo who was that" "Oh he's just a friend"  
"Don't gimme that don't ever give that  
Puh-lease don't give that oh bring it back"  
Generosity should be your motto  
Huh a lesson taught but a lesson not learned  
But the burned fool's smokin' I turned  
Kickin' flava in your ear but you still got beef  
Knowin' I need stitches you said "Get the fuck off the chief"  
The one you know as just a friend  
She's just a friend uh-huh huh  
You got what I need she's just a friend  
You got what I need she's just a friend  
You got what I need she's just a friend  
You got what I need she's just a friend  
You got what I need she's just a friend  
You got what I need she's just a friend  
You got what I need she's just a friend  
You got what I need she's just a friend

And he was gonna be my everything

So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

And he was gonna be my everything

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Yeah sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
Oh oh oh oh yeah
Verse 1:
All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid

Hold on to the light

Hold on to the light
Hold on to the light
Believe you will make it through

Verse 2:
You've got the power deep within
The strength to face the toughest times
And never lose faith in love's sweet promise
That you are meant to shine in life

And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid

Or high-priced tickets to the ball

Or big black cars or a shopping mall

To the bottom of the ocean

Fly the great big sky
See the great big sea
Kick through continents
Busting boundaries
Take it hip to hip
Rocket through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to roam around the world
Roam if you want to without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to roam around the world
Roam if you want to without anything but the love we feel

Skip the airwaves
And what it's got to say
Kiss the sky goodbye
And topple into the sea
Scope the desert
The ruins shipwrecks and monuments
Worship the sun
And dance naked in the Mediterranean

Roam if you want to roam around the world
Roam if you want to without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to roam around the world
Roam if you want to without anything but the love we feel

Roam the phone is off the hook
So leave a message at the tone
Roam nothing's gonna keep us apart
So come on let's roam
Verse 1:
The way your hand feels pressed hard against my body
Ignites a flame of love and lust inside
The way you kiss me so deep and so tender
It's like a drug that I can't deny

Chorus:
I want everything everything you've got to give
Come on baby give it to me give it to me
I need everything everything you've got to offer
Come on baby give it to me give it to me

Verse 2:
The way you move me like music in motion
Sends waves of pleasure through my soul
The way you love me so hard and so intense
It's like a dream that I can't control

Chorus

Don't hold back don't be shy
Let's take this passion to an all-time high
I want it all and I want it now
Let's make love until the sun goes down

I vow to be one with thee You and me hey
I vow to be one with thee You and me
All right stop collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop Yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gain way
You better hit bull's-eye the kid don't play

If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby
Vanilla x4

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point to the point no faking
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo

Rollin' in my 50
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
Did you stop No I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine

Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby
Vanilla x4

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast other DJs say "damn"
My rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby
Vanilla x4
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "With Every Beat of My Heart" by Taylor Dayne:

With every beat of my heart
With every breath I take
There's a voice down inside me
And it's filled with so much hate

I don't need to be afraid
I don't need to run and hide
I will stand up to the end
With the power that's inside

I will never give up
I will never give in
With every beat of my heart
I'll survive I'll win

I'm not one to be broken
I'm not one to be tamed
I will rise to the top
And I'll never be the same

With every beat of my heart
I will show the world I'm strong
I will conquer all the pain
And I'll prove them all wrong

I will never give up
I will never give in
With every beat of my heart
I'll survive I'll win

With every beat of my heart
I'll fight the fight
With every breath I take
I will see the light

I will never give up
I will never give in
With every beat of my heart
I'll survive I'll win
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never never need it
One headline why believe it
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world
You know I never meant to see you again  
But I only passed by as a friend yeah  
All this time I stayed out of sight  
I started wondering why  
Now I ooh now I wish it would rain down down on me  
Ooh yes I wish it would rain rain down on me now  

You said you didn't need me in your life  
I guess you were right  
Well I never meant to cause you no pain  
But it looks like I did it again  
Now and though all the commotion  
It's something I don't wanna live without  
So I say now ooh now now now now  

I wish it would rain down down on me  
Ooh yes I wish it would rain down on me  
Ooh baby let it rain  
Let it rain  
Oh let it rain  

Now I know it's all been a game  
That I've been playing down  
And if you don't wanna know me now  
You will never ever see me again  
I'm gonna go on down the road  
And find somebody else like you  

Cause I know you'll do  

Like you done before  
You'll do me wrong again  
And that's why and that's why  
I say  

I wish it would rain down down on me  
Ooh yes I wish it would rain down on me  
Ooh baby let it rain  
Let it rain  
Oh let it rain  

I wish it would rain  
Down on me  

I wish it would rain  
Down on me  
I wish it would rain  
Down on me  

Ooh baby let it rain  
Ooh baby let it rain
Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Price of Love" by Bad English:


I'm standing tough
I'm living rough
I know no other way
Each day's a fight
For what is right
I know I have to pay


The price of love
The cost of living free
The price of love
Is paid in agony


I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna be
The apple of your eye
And when the clouds
Begin to clear
We're gonna see the sky


The price of love
The cost of living free
The price of love
Is paid in agony


It's a game of give and take
It's a line you have to walk
But in the end
When it's all been said and done
It's worth the price you pay


The price of love
The cost of living free
The price of love
Is paid in agony
The price of love
The cost of living free
The price of love
Is paid in agony
Verse 1:
I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see that I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feelin' down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Chorus:
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside 'cause love takes time

Verse 2:
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are fallin' down endlessly endlessly

Chorus:
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside 'cause love takes time

Bridge:
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart

To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside 'cause love takes time

Outro:
Heal when you're hurting so much
You can't escape the pain
Love takes time love takes time
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Just Like Jesse James" by Cher:

He's a loaded gun
He's got me on the run
He's a six-foot six-inch stick of dynamite
He's the one who gives his life
When we make our love alive
Only my death is gonna stop him tonight

Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
I'll be riding
I'll be riding tonight
Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
I'll be riding
I'll be riding tonight

He's got a heart of stone
And a wandering eye
And a heaviness I can't explain
Like a thief in the night
Like a runaway train
I'm a victim of his passion and his pain

Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
I'll be riding
I'll be riding tonight
Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
I'll be riding
I'll be riding tonight

He's a cowboy with a burning touch
He's a lesson in pain
He's the devil he's a saint
He's a contradiction in love
I see a dangerous smile
And he's a danger to know
He's a heartache from the moment that you say hello

Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
I'll be riding
I'll be riding tonight
Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
I'll be riding
I'll be riding tonight

Ohh just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James
Just like Jesse James

Late at night  
When I'm all alone  
I think of you  
And I start to moan  
Romeo Romeo Juliette Juliette  
If we don't do it now  
We'll regret it baby  
And I don't want that  
Cause I need your love  
And I need it bad  
Romeo Romeo Juliette Juliette  

Please note that these lyrics may contain explicit language or mature content
Some people's lives run down like clocks
One day they stop and that's all they've got
Some lives wear out like old tennis shoes
No surprise when they give way to the blues
But mine's had its ups and downs
Still I love life tragedies and clowns
I need highs and I need lows
And I need to have a place to go
Oh if you want to find me tonight
I go to extremes
Where you don't need to light
A fireplace
Just to keep yourself warm
If you want to find me tonight
I go to extremes
My world slows down
But my heart beats fast
Right between the sound machine
And the haunted glass

Some people never see the light
Till it shines through bullet holes
And you might be that way
If you don't let these songs control your soul
Don't say you'll never find your way
When tangled roads have come undone
'Cause somewhere out there in this life
There's a good man gunnin' down a son
Oh if you want to find me tonight
I go to extremes
Where you don't need to light
A fireplace
Just to keep yourself warm
If you want to find me tonight
I go to extremes
My world slows down
But my heart beats fast
Right between the sound machine
And the haunted glass

Call me a jigsaw puzzle
Might take me forever to find my way
Wake me when things get started
And remind me of how I'll be leaving yesterday

Oh if you want to find me tonight
I go to extremes
Oceans of violins swell
Restless longings of my soul
And the woman that I need
If you want to find me tonight
I go to extremes
My world slows down
But my heart beats fast
Right between the sound machine
And the dream that lasted all night
And the feelings that went with it
Make it stop
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "When I'm Back on My Feet Again" by Michael Bolton:

Gonna break these chains around me
Gonna learn to fly again
May be hard may be hard
But I'll do it
When I'm back on my feet again

Soon these tears will all be dryin'
Soon these eyes will see the sun
Might take time might take time
But I'll see it
When I'm back on my feet again

When I'm back on my feet again
No there ain't nothing gonna hold me down
Oh once I get my feet back on the ground
Won't stop me now

I'm gonna climb up high
I'm gonna see my face in the sky
I'm gonna live gonna live gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond
Brighter than the sun
When I'm back on my feet again

Soon these tears will all be dryin'
Soon these eyes will see the sun
Might take time might take time
But I'll see it
When I'm back on my feet again

When I'm back on my feet again
No there ain't nothing gonna hold me down
Oh once I get my feet back on the ground
Won't stop me now

I'm gonna climb up high
I'm gonna see my face in the sky
I'm gonna live gonna live gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond
Brighter than the sun
When I'm back on my feet again

When I'm back on my feet again
I'll walk proud down this street again
And they'll all look at me again
And they'll see that I'm strong
I'm gonna hear my children laughing
And hold my wife again
Gonna live gonna love
And I'll be a better man
When I'm back on my feet again

When I'm back on my feet again
When I'm back on my feet again
When I'm back on my feet again

I gotta tell you what I'm feeling inside
I could lie to myself but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes
Girl I'm out of my head over you
And I lived so long believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time


It's forever this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever until my life is through girl I'll be loving you forever


Just listen to my heart lay your body next to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight that you are here to stay


It's forever this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever until my life is through girl I'll be loving you forever


We'll sail the endless skies
Forever oh forever
Until the end of time


It's forever this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever until my life is through girl I'll be loving you forever


We'll sail the endless skies
Forever oh forever
Until the end of time
Full uncensored lyrics to "Without You" by Mötley Crüe

Without you without you
I never want to live without you without you
I never want to live without you without you

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me oh
I can't help myself I've gotta see you
Even if it's just to say "Goodbye"

Bye bye baby why can't you just stay with me tonight
Stay with me tonight hey
Bye bye baby don't leave me alone with my pride
How am I gonna be alone with my pride

How am I gonna be alone with my pride

Without you without you
I never want to live without you without you
I never want to live without you without you

This is the time of our lives but we just can't go back
We're each other's destiny mm don't wanna be without you
There's gotta be another way 'cause I don't wanna live without you
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Without you without you
I never want to live without you without you
I never want to live without you without you

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Verse 1:
Mentirosa traicionera
No me importa lo que digas
Mentirosa te robaste mi amor
Y ahora no me queda nada

Chorus:
Que mentirosa eso es lo que tú eres
Para mí no eres nada no eres nada
Que mentirosa eso es lo que tú eres
Para mí no eres nada no eres nada

Verse 2:
Mentirosa nunca quisiste
Lo que yo te ofrecía
Mentirosa siempre dijiste
Que mi amor no te servía

Chorus:
Que mentirosa eso es lo que tú eres
Para mí no eres nada no eres nada
Que mentirosa eso es lo que tú eres
Para mí no eres nada no eres nada

Bridge:
Ahora me doy cuenta
De lo que tú eres capaz
Ahora me doy cuenta
Y no te quiero ver nunca más

Chorus:
Que mentirosa eso es lo que tú eres
Para mí no eres nada no eres nada
Que mentirosa eso es lo que tú eres
Para mí no eres nada no eres nada
She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir can you help me
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me"
He walks on doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice 'cause it's another day for you
You and me in paradise

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

Oh think twice 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Just think about it

Oh Lord is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh Lord there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh think twice 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Just think about it oh Lord is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh Lord there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh think twice 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Just think about it oh Lord is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh Lord there must be something you can say

Oh think twice 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise
Verse 1:
Though I'm trying to resist 
Being last on your list 
But no other man's gonna do 
So I'm saving all my love for you 
It's not very easy living all alone 
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own 
But each time I try I just break down and cry 
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue 

Chorus:
So I'm saving all my love for you 
You used to tell me we'd run away together 
Love gives you the right to be free 
You said be patient just wait a little longer 
But that's just an old fantasy 

Verse 2:
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more 
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door 
Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright 
We'll be making love the whole night through 
So I'm saving all my love 
Yeah I'm saving all my lovin' 
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 

Chorus:
For you for you for you for you 
For you for you I'm saving all my love 
Saving all my love for you 
For you for you for you for you 
For you for you for you 
I'm saving all my love for you
Outside another yellow moon  
Punched a hole in the nighttime yes  
I climb through the window and down to the street  
I'm shining like a new dime  
The downtown trains are full  
Full of all them Brooklyn girls  
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds  

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows  
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart  
They're just thorns without the rose  
Be careful of them in the dark  
Oh if I was the one  
You chose to be your only one  
Oh baby can't you hear me now  
Can't you hear me now  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Every night it's just the same  
You leave me lonely now  

I know your window and I know it's late  
I know your stairs and your doorway  
I walk down your street and past your gate  
I stand by the light at the four-way  
You watch them as they fall  
Oh baby they all have heart attacks  
They stay at the carnival but they'll never win you back  
Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Every night every night  
It's just the same  

You leave me lonely  
Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
All of my dreams just fall like rain  
All upon a downtown train  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Where every night every night  
It's just the same  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
All of my dreams just fall like rain  
All upon a downtown train  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Where every night every night  
It's just the same  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
All of my dreams just fall like rain  
All upon a downtown train  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Where every night every night  
It's just the same  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
All of my dreams just fall like rain  
All upon a downtown train  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Where every night every night  
It's just the same  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
All of my dreams just fall like rain  
All upon a downtown train  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Where every night every night  
It's just the same  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
All of my dreams just fall like rain  
All upon a downtown train  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Where every night every night  
It's just the same  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
All of my dreams just fall like rain  
All upon a downtown train  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Where every night every night  
It's just the same  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
All of my dreams just fall like rain  
All upon a downtown train  

Will I see you tonight  
On a downtown train  
Where every night every night  
It's just the same

One two three four


I'm sittin' in my room by myself
Staring at the walls contemplating my future
Trying to figure out what's next for me
Will I succeed or will I fail
These are the questions that I ask myself


Ready or not here I come
Gonna grab the world and make it mine
Ready or not here I come
Gonna live my life without any fear


I know that there will be ups and downs
But I'm willing to take that chance
I'll put in the work and dedication
To achieve my dreams and reach the top


Ready or not here I come
Gonna grab the world and make it mine
Ready or not here I come
Gonna live my life without any fear


I won't let anyone stand in my way
I'll push through the obstacles and the pain
I'll stay true to myself and my beliefs
And I'll never give up no matter what they say


Ready or not here I come
Gonna grab the world and make it mine
Ready or not here I come
Gonna live my life without any fear
Verse 1:
So you think that it's over 
That your love has finally reached the end 
Any time you call night or day 
I'll be right there for you if you need a friend 

Chorus:
It's gonna take a little time 
Time is sure to mend your broken heart 
Don't you even worry pretty darlin' 
I know you'll find love again yeah 

Verse 2:
Love is all around you 
Love is knockin' outside the door 
Waitin' for you is this love made just for two 
Keep an open heart and you'll find love again I know 

Chorus 

Bridge:
instrumental break 

Chorus 

Verse 3:
Love will find a way 
Darlin' love is gonna find a way 
Find its way back to you 
Love will find a way 

So look around open your eyes 
Love is gonna find a way 
Love is gonna love is gonna find a way 
Love will find a way 

Chorus 

Outro:
I know love will find a way for you 
Love is gonna find a way 
Love will find a way 
Love will find a way for you
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "All or Nothing" by Milli Vanilli:

Verse 1:
I could make a living from this dream
Don't want to let the chance go by
What gave you the right to kill my dreams
You should know better than to lie
I gave you all I had to give
But you didn't want me to stay
You didn't even try to change my mind
We just stood there and watched it all fade away

Chorus:
All or nothing nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart it doesn't I'd rather have nothing at all

Verse 2:
Everywhere I go everyone I meet
Won't let me forget what you've done to me oh no
But I won't cry I won't give in
I'll just hold on to my pride
It's so easy to draw from the past
Than to live for the future now's where it's at

Chorus:
All or nothing nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart it doesn't I'd rather have nothing at all

Bridge:
For what I've got I won't be sad
This is the worst that I've ever had
Life is too short to waste my time
I've got to move on and leave you behind

Chorus:
All or nothing nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart it doesn't I'd rather have nothing at all

Outro:
All or nothing nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart it doesn't I'd rather have nothing at all
"Boys and girls come sit on the right on this radam
You can dance until dawn till your feet are bleedin' out
No question posin' you are the one living truth
Can't deny my love for you

So come on and get my love it's here for you
I know you want my love I'll give it to you
Come on and get my love it's here for you
I know you need my love I'll give it to you

Give me what I'm missin' your love all around
Move it to the rhythm till the bass line comes
Good vibrations are happenin' can you feel the force
Jumpin' like a jackal diamonds on the dance floor

So come on and get my love it's here for you
I know you want my love I'll give it to you
Come on and get my love it's here for you
I know you need my love I'll give it to you

Just come and get it
Just come and get it
Just come and get my love
Just come and get it

Boys and girls come sit on the right on this radam
You can dance until dawn till your feet are bleedin' out
No question posin' you are the one living truth
Can't deny my love for you

So come on and get my love it's here for you
I know you want my love I'll give it to you
Come on and get my love it's here for you
I know you need my love I'll give it to you

Just come and get it
Just come and get it
Just come and get my love
Just come and get it"

I know there's pain
Why do lock yourself up in these chains
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind
Is it really fair to feel this way inside


Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let 'em
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day


Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day


You could sustain
Or are you comfortable with the pain
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness
You've got yourself into your own mess
Lettin' your worries pass you by
Don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind


Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on


She's dangerous
Superbad
Better watch out
She'll take you down
Cause she's poison

Lookin' for a girl that's always right
Someone who knows how to love me tight
All the time so tonight gonna make her mine

I'll put a spell on her you'll be its victim
She'll be the devil and you'll be its victim

She's dangerous
Superbad
Better watch out
She'll take you down
Cause she's poison

Every time that she walks the boys start runnin'
She's a heartbreaker if you get too close
If she had a gun with her name in your mind
You'd be dead in minutes flat

I'll put a spell on her you'll be its victim
She'll be the devil and you'll be its victim

She's dangerous
Superbad
Better watch out
She'll take you down
Cause she's poison

You've been warned dodged a bullet
Come on boys let's believe
Dangerous can't resist her
Come on boys let's believe

I'll put a spell on her you'll be its victim
She'll be the devil and you'll be its victim

She's dangerous
Superbad
Better watch out
She'll take you down
Cause she's poison
I don't know if it is appropriate to provide uncensored lyrics for a song However I will fulfill your request

I wake up in the morning
And I raise my weary head
I got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed


This is a deadly game we play
We're players on a stage
We'll take the final bow some get applause
And some get to rage yeah


I woke up the next morning
With a smile upon my face
My mind told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart begged my mind for grace


This is a deadly game we play
We're players on a stage
We'll take the final bow some get applause
And some get to rage yeah


And when she walked in
Her eyes were like "come be with me awhile"
But I drew one step closer
And I was caught up in the moment's smile


This is a deadly game we play
We're players on a stage
We'll take the final bow some get applause
And some get to rage yeah




We're just pilgrims on this road boy
And sooner or later
We'll all be called upon to choose
Which way to go


This is a deadly game we play
We're players on a stage
We'll take the final bow some get applause
And some get to rage yeah


Somebody said "all this world's a stage"
And we must play a part
Fate had me playing in love
You as the starring role in my heart
