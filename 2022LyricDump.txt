Woke up lonely in this place
I think the tides are changing
Seems like I been away for a while now
And in my head I'm just sittin' here dreading
And in this town there's only so much to do
The feelings they're catching up with me
I'm trying to fight but I'm losing to
Feel like I'm breaking down I think I'm breaking down


And I don't wanna hear it Anymore
And I tried to change it To something
But my head is a Tortured
And I'm here on my own


I don't wanna think about it too much too much too much too much
Too much too much too much too much
I don't wanna talk about it at all at all
At all at all at all at all
I just wanna hold you tight you tight
You tight you tight you tight you tight
Without a fear in my heart
Fear in my heart heart heart


And I don't wanna hear it
And I tried to change it
But my head is a Tortured
And I'm here on my own


I just wanna see you I just wanna see you
And hold you And hold you
Anytime anywhere you go Anywhere you go
I'll follow you down down down down
I'll follow you down down down down
I'll follow you down down down down
I'll follow you down Down down down down


Don't wanna hear it anymore
And I tried to change it
But my head is a Tortured
And I'm here on my own

It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
 Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you're thinkin' what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face so beautiful
Please woman don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery


Tell me that I'm the only one that you need
Baby you can stop the hurtin' it'll be alright
Tell me all that you're runnin' from
And now you think you got me oh no
But I I I know
I know that you got me oh no


It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
You're walkin' on a high wire caught up in your own lie
Again why do I always fight Yeah
You writin' vows that you gon' break Break
You always wanna give but you never take Take
You're runnin' in circles baby relax
You talkin' to your ex you need to relax
Tell me that I'm the only one that you need Only one

Verse 1:
There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim when I am drowning

Pre-Chorus:
In this silence baby let me in
Go easy on me baby
I was still a child didn't get the chance to feel
The world around me had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

Chorus:
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I change who I was to put you both first

Pre-Chorus:
But now I give up go easy on me baby
I was still a child didn't get the chance to feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

But I know right now it probably doesn't even show

Chorus:

Avecina no disimules ya
Lo que ves no es normal
Lo que hablaban tus abuelos
Es verdad en realidad



Y es que Bruno es un problema
No se sabe bien su edad
De su boca vuela el ave
Y su nieve nunca es normal



Bruno tiene su guarida
En la cima del colchón
Su fiesta siempre espera
No se sabe cuál es la razón



En la mesa nada raro
Agua clara arroz y feijão
Pero cuando Bruno ríe
Se levanta vivo el chão



Un misterio imposible
Un susurro en la ciudad
Una sombra en la ventana
Y un silbido en el portal



Bruno lleva su guitarra
Aunque casi nunca toca
Y si estás hablando blanco
Para Bruno ya es poca broma



El viento trae malas noticias
Desde el monte cercano
La leyenda sigue viva
Más que nunca aquel verano



Consejo de nuestros mayores
“Mira siempre hacia delante”
Aunque el pasado se repita
Es el futuro que te cambia la vida



Bruno no es lo que parece
Es mi secreto mejor guardado
Vive en mi historia escondida
Pero la huella ha dejado



We don't talk 'bout Bruno
No no no no
We don't talk 'bout Bruno
But there's nothing that he doesn't know
So when you're all alone
And there's no one left to call
When you meet the eyes of Bruno
You're in the Mirror Room after all



En el patio brujo loco
Se despierta por demás
Cuando todos están durmiendo
Bruno toca su cristal



Pero si en ti Bruno cree
Te adopta en su hogar
Alimenta a tus pesadillas
Para siempre acompañar



La oscuridad encuentra
Una luz en su hogar
Algo que Bruno enseña
Es que el miedo no es el mal



El viento trae malas noticias
Desde el monte cercano
La leyenda sigue viva
Más que nunca aquel verano



Consejo de nuestros mayores
“Mira siempre hacia delante”
Aunque el pasado se repita
Es el futuro que te cambia la vida



Bruno no es lo que parece
Es mi secreto mejor guardado
Vive en mi historia escondida
Pero la huella ha dejado



We don't talk 'bout Bruno
No no no no
We don't talk 'bout Bruno
But there's nothing that he doesn't know
So when you're all alone
And there's no one left to call
When you meet the eyes of Bruno
You're in the Mirror Room after all

But I just can't get enough of your body body
And I know you're attached too attached
But that don't stop me from giving you back what she lacks

Chorus:

Well good for you I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world
Dah-duh-duh-duh


And good for you I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl


Well good for you you look happy and healthy not me
If you ever cared to ask
Dah-duh-duh-duh


Good for you you're doin' great out there without me baby
Like a damn sociopath


I've lost my mind I've spent the night cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected I really don't get it
But I guess good for you


Well good for you I guess you're gettin' everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off
It's like we never even happened baby


What the fuck is up with that And good for you it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Dah-duh-duh-duh


Person who ever got you Well screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do


Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all


Well good for you you look happy and healthy not me
If you ever cared to ask
Dah-duh-duh-duh


Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me baby
Like a damn sociopath
Verse 1:
I'm just a numb little bug
Flying towards a blinding light
I am drawn towards it like a moth to a flame
And I know that I'm gonna get burned

Chorus:
Numb little bug that's all I am
Lost in this world like a grain of sand
I'm searching for something but I don't know what
Just a numb little bug lost in the love

Verse 2:
I try to find my way
But the darkness always wins
I'm caught in a web a maze of confusion
And I know that there's no escape

Chorus:
Numb little bug that's all I am
Lost in this world like a grain of sand
I'm searching for something but I don't know what
Just a numb little bug lost in the love

Bridge:
I try to break free but I'm trapped in my own mind
I wish that I could fly away leave it all behind
But I'm just a numb little bug with no place to go
Lost in the world with nowhere to show

Chorus:
Numb little bug that's all I am
Lost in this world like a grain of sand
I'm searching for something but I don't know what
Just a numb little bug lost in the love

Outro:
Numb little bug that's all I am
Lost in this world like a grain of sand
Just a numb little bug lost in the love

Trying to put my heart back together again

But the neon signs keep on screaming

Chorus:
‘Til you can’t remember who you’re missing
‘Til you can’t feel the tears you’re crying
‘Til you’re falling down on the hardwood floor
And saying words you can’t take back no more
‘Til you’re looking in the mirror
Saying things you ain’t proud of yourself
And you’d do anything to change
‘Til you can’t change nothing else

Verse 2:
The band’s playing something sad and lonely
And all these people are trying to console me
But it takes more than a stranger’s empathy
To drown out the memory of your memory

Chorus:
‘Til you can’t remember who you’re missing
‘Til you can’t feel the tears you’re crying
‘Til you’re falling down on the hardwood floor
And saying words you can’t take back no more
‘Til you’re looking in the mirror
Saying things you ain’t proud of yourself
And you’d do anything to change
‘Til you can’t change nothing else

Bridge:
You can dull the pain with whiskey
Or you can try to dance it away
But the only way to really heal is time
And a whole lot of nights like this

Chorus:
‘Til you can’t remember who you’re missing
‘Til you can’t feel the tears you’re crying
‘Til you’re falling down on the hardwood floor
And saying words you can’t take back no more
‘Til you’re looking in the mirror
Saying things you ain’t proud of yourself
And you’d do anything to change
‘Til you can’t change nothing else

Outro:
‘Til you can’t change nothing else

Two straws one check girl I got you

Verse 1:
You heard my cries
You walked through fire
You broke out the chains
You shattered my fears
You saw my heart
You held it in your hands
And now I won't give it up

Chorus:
I won't let you break my soul
No I won't succumb to you
You'll never make me feel alone
I won't let you break my soul

Verse 2:

Tried to make me frown
But I fought and I won
And now I stand tall
You can't touch me now

Chorus:
I won't let you break my soul

No I won't succumb to you
You'll never make me feel alone
I won't let you break my soul

You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye


I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away


Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day

Met you once under a Pisces moon

Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it I put you through hell


I don't know why I run away
Oh boy I'll make you cry when I run away


Boy take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better


If you knew I was gonna be this way
If you knew what I've been through yeah
If you knew why you couldn't stay
If you knew how I'd make you feel


I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away


Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better


Save your tears for another day

You know I'm fly as hell can't mimic
Tried to please her but I ain't get it

Gotta put my niggas on not just one

This ain't no casino shit you can't read my mind
I'ma get the money that's the bottom line

She wanna suck the dick but that's one of mine

'Bout to go get some racks and hit the ground runnin'
Can't let 'em catch me can't let 'em get me
I won't go back to livin' off chips

I gotta watch my surroundings I can't be seen
You can't play both sides can't be in between
Racks on racks racks on racks on racks
I got racks on racks on racks
I got racks on racks on racks on racks on racks
I got racks on racks on racks
I got racks on racks on racks on racks on racks

Verse 1:
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driver dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird an' then he was gone
Had me feeling about ten feet tall
An' so I called up my baby
An' I said

Chorus:
Don't you know that man is outta his mind
We're gonna do what we want to any old time
Baby we could do no wrong
That's why we got a love that's strong
Yes she had me at "Heads Carolina tails California"
Somewhere greener somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains down by the ocean
Where It don't matter as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina tails California

Verse 2:
Somewhere greener somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains down by the ocean
Where It don't matter as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina tails California

Chorus x2

Greedy love eatin' like a feasting

I'd rather take shots shots shots like I'm vegan
I know you love to talk but I ain't come to speakin'

Put my hand around my waist give a stranger a fix

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Buy Dirt" by Jordan Davis and Luke Bryan:


I ain't rich but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day ain't working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can't buy happiness
But it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well maybe so
But it could buy me a boat


They call me redneck white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can't fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I'm sure that's probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool
'Cause it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well maybe so
But it could buy me a boat


It could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yetti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well maybe so
But it could buy me a four-wheel drive
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well maybe so
But it could buy me a boat


They call me redneck white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can't fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I'm sure that's probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool
'Cause it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well maybe so
But it could buy me a boat


Yeah and I know what they say
Money can't buy everything
Well maybe so
But it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a boat yeah
I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm blessed but I'm still heartless yeah
I love you I hate you I hate you I love you
I'm bad at keeping my composure
I'm bad at keeping my bad at keeping my
I love you I hate you I hate you I love you
I'm bad at keeping my composure
I'm bad at keeping my bad at keeping my
She said "Maybe I would love you more if you took off your clothes"
And opened up walked through this door
And kneel to the gods in a room full of idols
And tell me you love me doesn't mean that much to me
I'm sorry but I'm just not sorry
I love you I hate you I hate you I love you
I'm bad at keeping my composure
I'm bad at keeping my bad at keeping my
I love you I hate you I hate you I love you
I'm bad at keeping my composure
I'm bad at keeping my bad at keeping my

First time I seen her walk by man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road drippin' like a honeycomb
No one knows how to get me goin' quite like you do
You're like that rare antique ain't ever letting go
Baby you're like sand in my boots

Got me shootin' straighter than a twenty gauge
Heart knockin' like a knockin' on a front door please
People try to turn us around but we keep on going
'Cause we don't wanna be like them we'll just be ourselves

Body like a back road drippin' like a honeycomb
No one knows how to get me goin' quite like you do
You're like that rare antique ain't ever letting go
Baby you're like sand in my boots

Got a town that ain't nothin' but a wide spot on a map
Got a brand new guitar and a ten pack of strings
Trying to make a name everybody's lookin' for something
I'm thinkin' 'bout you I'm thinkin' 'bout me I'm thinkin' 'bout us

Body like a back road drippin' like a honeycomb
No one knows how to get me goin' quite like you do

Verse 1:
 
Si tengo un error en la mirada no es que yo te quiera clavar la espada
Pero ando en la maldad y eso me encanta ay
Pienso que nos conocemos pero no es así
Yo tal vez te ilusioné no te enamoré
Tu corazón es noble no es para mí
Trato de explicarte pero no creo que lo entiendas
Si tú quieres ser mi esposa yo quiero más bien que seas mi amante ay

Pre-Chorus:
 
Fumando en Provenza yo me pregunto qué pasó esa noche contigo baby
Y en mi mente no hay un recuerdo ay
Nos juntamos baby y eso quedó ahí
Y aunque me ha llegado el rumor ay
Que tienes compromiso y te vas a casar ay
No te juzgo y no me juzgues
Todo esto es un momento está ahí y luego se mueve

Chorus:
 
Fumando en Provenza yo me pregunto qué pasó esa noche contigo baby
Y en mi mente no hay un recuerdo
Nos juntamos baby y eso quedó ahí
Fumando en Provenza yo me pregunto qué pasó esa noche contigo baby
Y en mi mente no hay un recuerdo
Nos juntamos baby y eso quedó ahí

I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
Make my wish come true all I want for Christmas is you yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
Make my wish come true all I want for Christmas is you yeah

I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight holding on to me so tight
What more can I do Baby all I want for Christmas is you yeah

All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Won't you please bring my baby to me

I don't want a lot for Christmas this is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
Make my wish come true baby all I want for Christmas is you yeah

All I want for Christmas is you baby all I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby all I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby all I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby all I want for Christmas is you baby
  
You say you love me I say you crazy  
We're nothing more than friends  
You're not my lover more like a brother  
I known you since we were like ten yeah

  
Don't mess it up talking that shit  
Only gonna push me away that's it  
When you say you miss me that make me wanna come back  
And when I see you coming I just wanna run away  

  
And baby you're no good  
Thinking maybe you should  
Know that maybe I'm no good  
  
Na na na-ah  
Na na na-ah  
Na na na-ah  

  
She's a‑friendly reminder of a time  
When life was so much simpler  
And my heart was young and free  
I wish back then I'd known her  
But then again there's no one  
That could've ever known  
And nobody knows where it goes  
  
But you don't need me to be  
Your That's Okay I'm not your Breaking Me  
One day you'll find someone that'll treat you right  
And ease all of your sORRies  
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Camila…

Soy el culo en largo
'Toy secuestrando la liga
Tú ere' una amenaza pero sin mí no sales de la pista
Ya tú está' en la mira
Y no hay nadie que te salve
La baby se ve rica y boyante matándolo' con dm's
Dice' que quiere' una mami que te dé dinero y sexo
Mientras el novio se mata en la planta pa' comprarte el nuevo
Siempre' comprando' seguidore' nunca me verá' en tu casa
Dime si quiere' quedar y le caigo con to'a la banda
Ahora to'a' me quieren
Antes puñeta' de mi cuenta
Si te pasaba' por mi verse era' otro' más que no trascendían
Dejé mi utilería pa' que lo graben en slow motion
Subí con Bad Bunny la carrera de to's la sazon'
Dime quién te controla dime quién te toca
Que despierta tus ganas cuándo suena la nota
Dime quién te controla dime quién te toca
Que te hace acabá' y después te deja' en rota
Dime quién te controla eh
Dime quién te toca
Que te hace acabá' y después te deja' en rota ey
Yo soy el tipo que te prende
E' lo que a ti te conviene
Contigo se corre la voz
Que eres una p*** pero fina
Me dice' que quiere' de to' pero nadie te lo hace
La Roberto Cavalli que tiene' no sabe lo que se trae
Nadie sabe lo que pasa pero se ve divina
La baby a veces quiere ser pasiva pero a veces quiere' dominar
Porque yo soy tu tipo tu jefe y favorito
Si en alguna te faltas a mí me haces el favorcito
Perdío' perreo' en la calle
Buscando nueva Presi' pa' que como Berlín la calle tenga' caliente
Dime quién te controla dime quién te toca
Que despierta tus ganas cuándo suena la nota
Dime quién te controla dime quién te toca
Que te hace acabá' y después te deja' en rota

Verse 1:
Somebody please wake me up
I must be dreaming
I can't lose what I never had
And can't keep what's not mine
We're losing it we're losing it
We're losing it we're losing it
We're losing it we're losing it
We're losing it we're losing it

Chorus:
Oh my God don't you feel me
I'm in the rhythm it's a part of me
And it's taking control of me
I need you to hold on to me
I need you to hold on

Verse 2:
I'm seeing things that ain't real
And feeling things that don't exist
I'm catching feelings for no reason at all
We're losing it we're losing it
We're losing it we're losing it
We're losing it we're losing it
We're losing it we're losing it

Chorus:
Oh my God don't you feel me
I'm in the rhythm it's a part of me
And it's taking control of me
I need you to hold on to me
I need you to hold on to me

Bridge:
Wish that I could change the way I feel
But I can't deny the way I feel
The rhythm's got a hold on me
And it's taking control of me

Chorus:
Oh my God don't you feel me
I'm in the rhythm it's a part of me
And it's taking control of me
I need you to hold on to me
I need you to hold on to me

Outro:
We're losing it we're losing it
We're losing it we're losing it
We're losing it we're losing it

Verse 1: Mae Muller
Used to be the one with the sun
Used to be the one with the fun
Now I'm feeling like I'm blacking out
Used to have the highs now I'm feeling down

Chorus: Mae Muller
Maybe we'll have better days
Better days better days
Don't let it get away
Don't let it get away
Maybe we'll have better days
Better days better days
Don't let it get away
Don't let it get away

Verse 2: Polo G
Still can't believe I made it through
All the tough times we done made it through
I know the feeling when they hated you
I know the feeling when they faking too
Gotta keep a pistol you'll never know
The devil's working hard to set you up
And I don't know who to trust these days
I depend on my protection that's my 38

Chorus: Mae Muller
Maybe we'll have better days
Better days better days
Don't let it get away
Don't let it get away
Maybe we'll have better days
Better days better days
Don't let it get away
Don't let it get away

Give me a memory
I can use
Take pictures of anything
That's true
Sweet thoughts of you
Would be enough
But the problem is
I can't get enough
Of you


Meet me at our spot
Kissing in the back
Of the car parking lot
Where we used to
Smoke and talk
Just like that
Meet me at our spot


Yellow lights in my rearview
It's you
Said you wanted to know
What my fears are
I fear losing you
I fear the thought of you
Ever loving someone else
I don't do well with
Emotions
I been tryna hide 'em
But you got me feeling
Like a kid again


Meet me at our spot Oh yeah
Kissing in the back
Of the car parking lot
Where we used to
Smoke and talk Smoke and talk
Just like that Just like that
Meet me at our spot


No one has to know
Just you and me
All the magic
That we do alone
Don't look back
Baby don't you ever go
Our spot is sacred
Homey that's for sure
Our spot is sacred


Meet me at our spot Our spot
Kissing in the back
Of the car parking lot
Where we used to
Smoke and talk Smoke and talk
Just like that Just like that
Meet me at our spot Our spot

I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now


Oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days


And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well yeah


Maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there I remember it all too well
Hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all all all too well


Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone


But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well

But baby don't you go let's talk this through
I know I'm hard to hold but I'm begging you

Rockin' around the Christmas tree 
At the Christmas party hop 
Mistletoe hung where you can see 
Every couple tries to stop 

Rockin' around the Christmas tree 
Let the Christmas spirit ring 
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie 
And we'll do some caroling 

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear 
Voices singing let's be jolly 
Deck the halls with boughs of holly 

Rockin' around the Christmas tree 
Have a happy holiday 
Everyone dancing merrily 
In the new old-fashioned way 

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear 
Voices singing let's be jolly 
Deck the halls with boughs of holly 

Rockin' around the Christmas tree 
Have a happy holiday 
Everyone dancing merrily 
In the new old-fashioned way
Verse 1:
I just flew back to the West I think I brought some shells
You know I keep that pistol on me sorry can't do no jail
Girl your booty is enormous
Like a tractor trailer truck
You can't unf**k all the n***as that you f**ked

Chorus:
Puffin' on zootz stiff arm a opp

F**k you if you hatin' you a damn lie

Verse 2:
Told my n***a hit the gas we gon' put that s**t on blast
Shoot him in his nose he gon' turn into a bah-dah-bah-bahst
Steady countin' up this cash

Lil Haiti with me he gone let his choppa squeeze

Lookin' at my wrist it'll cost your profit
F**k you if you hatin' you a damn lie

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Like I Love Country Music" by Kane Brown:

Verse 1:
I like gettin' high if you know what I mean
I'm addicted to that feelin' baby of another daydream
I'm a sucker for the way that it's changin' my mood
It's the same way that I feel 'bout them good ol' boots

Chorus:
I like my liquor strong and my women too
I like to sing 'bout those neon lights and honky-tonk attitude
I like my trucks lifted and my hat down low
Yeah I love my country lifestyle like I love country music whoa

Verse 2:
I like to hit the town makin' noise
I like to see the world through my new Rolls Royce
I like the way that new money feels in my hand
I love the fact that my fans tryna be my friend

Chorus:
I like my liquor strong and my women too
I like to sing 'bout those neon lights and honky-tonk attitude
I like my trucks lifted and my hat down low
Yeah I love my country lifestyle like I love country music whoa

Shittin' on what they don't know yeah
If you don't like it then don’t listen to me
No I ain't gonna change for no one

Chorus:

I like to sing 'bout those neon lights and honky-tonk attitude

Like I love my country music whoa
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

What a bright time it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
Verse 1:
I've been around enough to know how it goes
Wherever you run that's where your heart goes
On the one hand I love the chase
On the other I'm scared of the weight of a good thing

Chorus:
But every single time I try to walk away
Somethin' keeps on tellin' me you're here to stay
I don't know why I always look for what ain't
But I guess that's just the trouble with a heartbreak

Verse 2:
Say you only want a only want a only want a good time
Baby why'd you have to go and get me tonight
I've been down a road or two
But when I'm with you I think of nothing but you

Chorus:
But every single time I try to walk away
Somethin' keeps on tellin' me you're here to stay
I don't know why I always look for what ain't
But I guess that's just the trouble with a heartbreak

Bridge:
It's like I'm standing with my heart in my hand
Tryna find a way to make you understand
I can't help who I am
And who I am well that's a man with a trouble with a heartbreak

Chorus:
But every single time I try to walk away
Somethin' keeps on tellin' me you're here to stay
I don't know why I always look for what ain't
But I guess that's just the trouble with a heartbreak

Outro:
I guess that's just the trouble with a heartbreak
I guess that's just the trouble with a heartbreak
Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Ho ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas
This year
Verse 1:
I like my trucks four-wheel my beer ice-cold
And my girls with their boots on who can go all night no no
I like my paycheck cashed my boots in the dirt
My pants down low with a little bit of hurt

Chorus:
Yeah I live and I love by the words of a country song

And I'll keep it country let my boots do the walkin'
And my heart do the talkin' damn straight

I like the sound of my steel guitar yeah
And the fiddle's gotta be from Texas oh yeah

And damn straight I still hold these truths
I've been raised on bibles babes and bullets
And I'll keep it country let my boots do the walkin'
And my heart do the talkin' damn straight

Bridge:
Some say we're livin' just a little too late
We should've been born in another age
But we like our music loud and our chains a little too heavy
We're gonna keep on singin' and sayin'

Chorus:
Yeah we live and we love by the words of a country song
And damn straight we still hold these truths
We've been raised on bibles babes and bullets
And we'll keep it country let our boots do the walkin'
And our hearts do the talkin' damn straight

Outro:
Yeah we'll keep it country and damn straight

I hate the way she looks at you
With lips all red and eyes so blue
I'm sick of all the games she plays
She's got a hold on you it's just not fair


I'll change my hair change my name
Give myself a total makeover baby
I'll lose some pounds I'll hit the town
But she'll never be as good as me
She's all I wanna be yeah

But I could be the girl for you
I'll do everything she'll never do
Just say the word I'm into you

Verse 1:
I ain't never been the rose type
But maybe that's changing changing tonight
I heard you was the weed type
Maybe we could light up and take flight
I ain't sayin' that we perfect
But we move together like synchronic
I ain't sayin' that we're worth it
But we're worth a try worth a try

Chorus:
I don't need no flower shops
To feel your love feel your love

To feel your love feel your love

Verse 2:
I know that I'm no angel
But you still keep me high like that angel
Wrap me up in your tangles
Got me wrapped up in all your angles

But we move together like we're worth it
I ain't sayin' that we're worth it
But we're worth a try worth a try

I couldn't fall asleep last night
Thinking about the things I gotta do right
Trying to make my way to the brightside
Need to smile more need to hide less
Can't seem to get rid of my stress
Can I get a ride to the moon tonight 


Take me to the moon 
I want to fly away
Give me the strength to leave today
Take me to the moon 
I want to feel alive 
Leave my troubles behind 
Take me to the moon 


Can I take a trip to the moon
Where happiness is not too soon 
Can I escape from this messy room
Need a place where I can breathe 
Somewhere that knows how to grieve 
Can I go to the moon tonight 


Take me to the moon 
I want to fly away
Give me the strength to leave today
Take me to the moon 
I want to feel alive 
Leave my troubles behind 
Take me to the moon 


Take me to the moon oh 
Take me to the moon 
Take me to the moon oh 
Take me to the moon

You read me wrong again
You locked me up in your wishing well
But your leniency is just emptiness
Don't play me like a show and tell


Circles around this town
And you're only getting dizzy
You keep running me down
But I'mma keep on living


I'm a target innocent
Disarming all your ammo hitting them
You fixed your sight without a clue
I'm the wolf running right to you


Circles around this town
And you're only getting dizzy
You keep running me down
But I'mma keep on living


Looking for a white flag
In the corners of your mind
'Cause you swear you got me got me
But you're running out of time


Circles around this town
And you're only getting dizzy
You keep running me down
But I'mma keep on living
And circles around this town
And you're only getting dizzy
You keep running me down
But I'mma keep on living
I'd love to provide the uncensored lyrics of "Shivers" by Ed Sheeran here:

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and something more
Ooh yeah I want it all

Lipstick on my guitar
Strumming to a rhythm in my head
She said "play it again" I said "okay"
I wonder if she's into me or plays for the team

I'm so caught up in how she moves
I'm so caught up in her perfume
Ooh yeah
I'm addicted to the way she moves

I took an arrow to the heart
And I'm down staring at the floor
Uh huh uh huh
Don't know how long I've been here

She be rocking like a G-O-D
Got me sweating in the middle of the club
Tonight this angel's gonna earn her wings
Ooh yeah so let me redeem my sins

She got me feeling like a kid again
She got me feeling like a kid again yeah
I got nothing left to lose yeah
Gladiator take off your shoes yeah

I'm so caught up in how she moves
I'm so caught up in her perfume
Ooh yeah
I'm addicted to the way she moves

I took an arrow to the heart
And I'm down staring at the floor
Uh huh uh huh
Don't know how long I've been here

Ooh yeah
And I just wanna lay down get close to you
Yeah yeah

Ooh yeah

I took an arrow to the heart
And I'm down staring at the floor
Uh huh uh huh
Don't know how long I've been here
Yeah yeah

All these plaques on the wall got me running out of space
Yeah the model girls wanna squirt it on my face
They saw me pushing 20 racks and they wanna see the race
I might come a steal your bitch cause I'm feeling like I'm Ace

She don't wanna be a freak no more she wanna classy guy
With a Bently Coupe and a bag of money even if it come with lies
Cause they know I'm the one they know I'm that guy
And they wanna see the story ended with a ride in the sky

First class seat on a plane I'm not a regular guy
Started with a YMCA in the ghetto now I'm reaping the prize
I got people that can sleep when they die
For foreign cars and what's between your thot's thighs

You know I'm feeling right
I been rolling all day without a stoplight
Still ain't getting no sleep at night
Yeah they tryna take a shot at the boy it's on sight

Made a lot of money still I never date a gold digger
Low key I'm a cold killer I'mma take her on a trip
If she coming like the old Taylor Swift
She the one that take the photo with ya

Got the big bands baby let the cash pile up
Bottles of the Ace spillin' on my tux
And I ain't giving no fucks
Party all night and I still can't get enough

A hundred of us they ain't never seen nothing like this
I ain't trying to be myself I'm tryna buy a friend
To come shoot a business meeting make it look like an accident
Cause I got kids and a woman that depend on it

First class seat on a plane I'm not a regular guy
Started with a YMCA in the ghetto now I'm reaping the prize
I got people that can sleep when they die
For foreign cars and what's between your thot's thighs

And I'll roam these streets alone
Heartbroken but not alone


Cause I've got a cold heart
And a cold heart truth
And a cold hearted love
And a cold blooded


I have taken all I can
But you give nothing
Oh but you give nothing
Now you're gone and I'm lost
And I'm blaming myself for the truth
Yes I'm blaming myself for the truth


Cause I've got a cold heart
And a cold heart truth
And a cold hearted love
And a cold blooded
The ice I skate on is thin
And I'm falling through

Don't you ever change
For me
'Cause I'm just trying to find my way
Wash away the pain


But I've got a cold heart
And a cold hearted love
And a cold heart
A cold heart

Black leather bag I'm strapped with a
Desert eagle in it ah

Nothin' here to fear no enemy
Won't catch me sleepin' ain't no restin' peacefully
Nothin' here to fear no enemy


Lookin' through my rear view clear view
Everything I'm seein' crystal Smith & Wesson
I'm bustin' shots up out the window like it's Westin
All these niggas change they vision just for
Pleasure living pressure shawty never
Loyalty beneath 'em rather ceilings over heaven
Dirt and mud all on my sneaks but I'mma keep it steppin'
'Round 'em with the Fendi bag hangin' off my neck
My life is too valuable too much invested
Lost my mama to the police that say it's a job
Well done
Justice where they fund
Got me feelin' like a hostage
Lost my pops damn
Hoping this shit would stop
But the cycle can't break if the enemy's the cops and the judge and the system
Controlling the place where we live in
If that ain't givin' a fuck
Then I don't know what it is
God bless the kids man
It doesn't matter what you say  
We'll be here every day  
Waiting for the song to begin  

Maybe then we'll know  
What it is that we're living for  

I know what you're thinking  
You will never understand  
The way it feels to live your life  
A thousand nights without a prayer  

But I'm not running away  
I'm running up that hill  
I'm running up that building  
If I only could ooh  

You don't want to hurt me  
But see how deep the bullet lies  
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder  
Ooh there is thunder in our hearts  

Is there so much hate for the ones we love  
Tell me we both matter don't we  
You be running up that hill  
You and me be running up a hill be running up a hill  

You and me won't be unhappy  
If they only could  
You be running up that hill  
You and me be running up that hill be running up that hill  

Feel like I'm drowning  
You be running up that hill  
Make a deal with God  
You and me be running up that hill  
If I only could  

You don't want to hurt me  
But see how deep the bullet lies  
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder  
Ooh there is thunder in our hearts  

Is there so much hate for the ones we love  
Tell me we both matter don't we  
You be running up that hill  
You and me be running up that hill be running up that hill  

You and me won't be unhappy  
And if they only could  
You be running up that hill  
You and me be running up that hill be running up that hill

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Kind of Love We Make" by Luke Combs:


Wakin' up to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far
From the stars


And I wanna tell you everything
Words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything from when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you


I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you
It's so hard
So hard


And I wanna tell you everything
Words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything from when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you


You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you


And I know that it's wrong
That I can't move on
But there's somethin' about you
If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you
I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "I Ain't Worried" by OneRepublic:


I ain't worried 'bout a single soul
Who gon' bring me down I got full control
Might've put my money on the wrong horse babe
But I ain't worried 'bout a goddamn thing


Oh no
You know I got my own back yeah
I don't need nobody else
When I look in the mirror
I don't hate what I see
Bad boy genes and tattoos
Just like my family


I ain't worried 'bout a single soul
Who gon' bring me down I got full control
Might've put my money on the wrong horse babe
But I ain't worried 'bout a goddamn thing


People always talking 'bout the world's on fire
They say there's no hope but still we never tire
I'ma do me you can do you
I don't need your help sorry if that's cruel


Oh no
You know I got my own back yeah
I don't need nobody else
When I look in the mirror

Bad boy genes and tattoos
Just like my family

Who gon' bring me down I got full control
Might've put my money on the wrong horse babe
But I ain't worried 'bout a goddamn thing
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Something in the Orange" by Zach Bryan:

There's something in the orange
That makes me run from you
But when you come around me
You know I just can't refuse

I've got this funny feeling
That builds up in my chest
Whenever I'm around you
I'm at my very best

There's something in the orange
That I just can't ignore
And every time you touch me
I just want more and more

I can't explain this feeling
It's taking over me
But I don't think I'm ready
For what this thing could be

There's something in the orange
That makes me lose control
And every time I see you
I'm giving up my soul

So I'll keep on running
And maybe someday I'll see
That the orange that you offered
Wasn't what I need to be

Verse 1:
I’ve been working all damn week
But the weekend’s finally here
So I’ll grab my keys and a cold one
Gonna let go of my fear

Pre-Chorus:
I don’t care what stress I’m feeling
I don’t need nobody else
I’ll lay my foot down on the pedal
And I’ll head straight to my personal

Chorus:
Rock and a hard place
That’s where I feel alive
That’s where I belong
Rock and a hard place
Where the music’s loud and wild
That’s where I’m strong

Verse 2:
I don’t care ‘bout no dress code
I’ll wear my jeans and my boots
Got my guitar in the backseat
And my eyes on the prize ain’t no dispute

Pre-Chorus:
I don’t need no nine to five
I don’t need nobody else
I’ll sing my truth and make ‘em listen
Til the lights fade and I cease to glisten

Chorus:
Rock and a hard place
That’s where I feel alive
That’s where I belong
Rock and a hard place
Where the music’s loud and wild
That’s where I’m strong

Bridge:
I don’t need the money
I don’t need the fame
All I need’s my guitar
And the music running through my veins

Chorus:
Rock and a hard place
That’s where I feel alive
That’s where I belong
Rock and a hard place
Where the music’s loud and wild
That’s where I’m strong
Verse 1:
Got a house on a hill got a skillet I still get a little bit hot when I'm feelin' chill
Got a boat that'll float got a truck that'll tow got a hell of a heart but it stays on low
Got a dog that'll fetch got a cat that'll stay got a bed that'll snatch all my worries away
Got a guitar that'll sing got these words that'll rhyme got a YETI full of good ol' Carolina shine

Chorus:
And I'm doin' this thing called livin' right
Doin' what I love and lovin' what I do tonight
Got it all lined up got it all figured out
This is who I am and this is what I'm about

Verse 2:
Got a chain-link fence with a little bit of rust got a Chevy that'll never ever give up
Got a guitar that'll twang got a song that'll soar got a house full of love with an open door
Got a fishin' lice license to chase my dreams got a hat that'll sit just right on me
Got a heart full of pride and a tank full of gas got a country boy life and it sure ain't bad

Chorus:
And I'm doin' this thing called livin' right
Doin' what I love and lovin' what I do tonight
Got it all lined up got it all figured out
This is who I am and this is what I'm about

Bridge:
Got a momma that loves me got a good-lookin' girl got a cabin up under the Georgia pines
Got a band that's tight got some friends that'll fight got a preacher that'll save me every time

Outro:
And I'm doin' this thing called livin' right
Doin' what I love and lovin' what I do tonight
Got it all lined up got it all figured out
This is who I am and this is what I'm about
I can do that Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Fingers Crossed" by Lauren Spencer-Smith:


Mmm mmm


I know we just met but I feel that connection
I've been searching for someone like you
You keep running through my mind I can't help my infatuation
Can't wait another minute I wanna get closer to you


Don't wanna waste no time playing games with you no lies
Don't wanna freak you out but I can't hold it back tonight


So fingers crossed that you feel the same way I do
And all the things that we talk about become truth
Fingers crossed we could be more than just friends
I'm hoping that this night never ends


It feels like we're the only two people in this room
And every time you touch me it sets me on fire
Don't need no hesitation I'm falling for your temptation
I can't go back now can't resist the desire


Don't wanna waste no time playing games with you no lies
Don't wanna freak you out but I can't hold it back tonight


So fingers crossed that you feel the same way I do
And all the things that we talk about become truth
Fingers crossed we could be more than just friends
I'm hoping that this night never ends


It's like we're moving in slow motion
I can see the sparks flying yeah we're golden
Fingers crossed hope we don't blow it
I just wanna be with you


So fingers crossed that you feel the same way I do
And all the things that we talk about become truth
Fingers crossed we could be more than just friends
I'm hoping that this night never ends


Fingers crossed that you feel the same way I do
And all the things that we talk about become truth
Fingers crossed we could be more than just friends
I'm hoping that this night never ends

Verse 1:
Buzzin' like a street light flirting with the stars
Passing back and forth like a mess of cheap cigars
All the pretty people wanna know our names
But they don't wanna know our pain
'Cause you're the soft glow of my insanity
And I'm the soundtrack of your tragedy

Chorus:
Take my name take my soul
Find someone you can't control
Let's get lost in each other's crazy
Take my heart take my pride
Breaking everything inside
Until we're just two hearts beating baby
Take my name

Verse 2:
We're like a bottle of gasoline and a lit cigarette
A little kiss of danger on the edge of a safety net
We play the long shots the broken beats
We're twisted up in the sheets
'Cause you're the smoke and I'm the flame
And we both wanna play the same game

Chorus:
Take my name take my soul
Find someone you can't control
Let's get lost in each other's crazy
Take my heart take my pride
Breaking everything inside
Until we're just two hearts beating baby
Take my name take my name

Bridge:
Wild and reckless you and me
We're runaway trains on the rails of destiny
We'll go down in flames just wait and see
We'll burn up like gasoline

Chorus:
Take my name take my soul
Find someone you can't control
Let's get lost in each other's crazy
Take my heart take my pride
Breaking everything inside
Until we're just two hearts beating baby
Take my name take my name
Take my name take my name

Verse 1:
Last night lonely was only a word
And love was just a song that we heard
Our hearts they were never aching
And time it was just for the taking

Chorus:
But now you're gone and it's real
And I'm living in a heartbreak that I can feel
Oh what am I supposed to do
When last night's lonely becomes today's blues

Verse 2:
I thought I was tough enough to take on love
But it's so much harder when push comes to shove
I'm lost and I'm feeling stranded
And I can't help but feel left empty-handed

Chorus:
But now you're gone and it's real
And I'm living in a heartbreak that I can feel
Oh what am I supposed to do
When last night's lonely becomes today's blues

Oh it's hard so hard to let go
But holding on is just another way of saying no
And I can't keep pretending
That I'm alright and this all has a happy ending

Chorus:
But now you're gone and it's real
And I'm living in a heartbreak that I can feel
Oh what am I supposed to do
When last night's lonely becomes today's blues

I was standing by the church

And deep as a wishing well
And I wait all day All day

And there's nowhere I'd lie I'd lie
And I swear this time This time
Giving me a sign A sign

In a world that ain't got no room for someone like me

This response contains explicit language as requested

Every time you come around you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'd lose it all if I don't lose it with you
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first-time spark
Started under neon lights then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'd lose it all if I don't lose it with you
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out now
And now my bad habits lead to late nights
Endin' alone conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'd lose it all if I don't lose it with you
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Got a Benz so big that bitch right beside me
Got a barrel lemon squeeze if a bitch try me

No problem here are the uncensored lyrics of "AA" by Walker Hayes:


It was AA when I thought of you
I almost dialed up your number too
I fight the urge but it's no use
It only comes when I'm feeling confused


And when I pour one it's always two
One's a good time but two I use
To sit and talk to sit and stare
At nothing wondering how you are out there


I'll never know because we don't speak
I gave you my all and it wasn't enough for you
But you know I still think about
How we could've had it all worked out


And when I pour one it's always two
One's a good time but two I use
To sit and talk to sit and stare
At nothing wondering how you are out there


It was AA when I thought of you

I've been watchin' you watchin' me
And I know you want it
You gettin' brave and I like that
I see you slip your jacket off
And I feel your heart beatin'
With each breath and your eyes locked on mine


Maybe we could hit the high rise
A little somethin' somethin' for the midnight
Darlin' you know you want it
And I know you won't forget it
If I get your number just promise me somethin'
Promise me you won't tell nobody
That's right girl keep it hush hush
Let's see if you can keep a secret


Got your heels so high hair just right
In that dress that's tight
And I know what's on your mind
Just a little romance and a slow dance
With somebody like me tonight
You know you need a good time


Maybe we could hit the high rise
A little somethin' somethin' for the midnight
Darlin' you know you want it
And I know you won't forget it
If I get your number just promise me somethin'
Promise me you won't tell nobody
That's right girl keep it hush hush
Let's see if you can keep a secret


Yeah we could keep it between us two
Nobody's gotta know what we do
Yeah girl it's just our secret
So let's see if you can keep it


Maybe we could hit the high rise
A little somethin' somethin' for the midnight
Darlin' you know you want it
And I know you won't forget it
If I get your number just promise me somethin'
Promise me you won't tell nobody
That's right girl keep it hush hush
Let's see if you can keep a secret


I'm 5 foot 9 and you're 6 foot 2

So come on and show me what you're goin' through

Ey ey


Mueve ese culo pa' acá a aquel pa' allá
Yo le di cien por el culo ya me ves ¿y qué
Se me puso en cuatro cuando el palo vio
La máscara de puerco en el Estadio Olímpico


Me la comería pero vomitaría
Le chupo los pezones ella me dice: "Ay ¡papi"


Moscow Mule' Moscow Mule'
¿Dónde está mi Moscow Mule'
Moscow Mule' Moscow Mule'
La baby llegó a la cima y no hay quien le baje


Me la chupó como un pitillo y mi' hoja'
Le di un lechazo al ojo - bájale que me cojo
Me gustó de suéter ¿qué te espera
Perdimos el invicto por un par de bañeras


Me la comería pero vomitaría
Le chupo los pezones ella me dice: "Ay ¡papi"


Moscow Mule' Moscow Mule'
¿Dónde está mi Moscow Mule'
Moscow Mule' Moscow Mule'
La baby llegó a la cima y no hay quien le baje


Tiene un culito que se deja ver
Un diamantito y un Rolex
Se hizo el más ella ya la chingó
Es 'e las mías le gusta el bellaco


Me la comería pero vomitaría
Le chupo los pezones ella me dice: "Ay ¡papi"


Moscow Mule' Moscow Mule'
¿Dónde está mi Moscow Mule'
Moscow Mule' Moscow Mule'
La baby llegó a la cima y no hay quien le baje

Tú eras mía baby lo sabe' to' el mundo Lo' mundo' lo' mundo'
Y ahora to' el mundo sabe que me tienes inseguro


No te puedo tener en la mente
No me niego sí me duele
Ya perdí yo me rendí
Hay alguien ahí esperando por ti


Después de la playa ¿eh
To' el día' metimo' enrrolla'o
Tú eras mía baby lo sabe' to' el mundo Lo' mundo' lo' mundo'
Y ahora to' el mundo sabe que me tienes inseguro

No saben quién soy ¿habrá alguien que no sepa ya
El libro está cerrado pa' abrirlo tienen que pagar
Antes no tenía nada ahora tengo lo que soñé
Y el día que me vaya' otro vendrá y apareceré' ey
Mira cómo le chingo' siempre la vuelvo a joder
Sigo en mi bloque el tuyo para variar también
Sigo en la calle tú en la 'uenta no te vaya' a caer
La fama es mentira no llena lo que tú quieres tener


Yeh yeh yeh yeh
¿Quién será el siguiente pa' vestirme y que aparezca
¿Será Nike o alguien que quiera quedarse con mi marca y mi inversión
¿Será que ahora con' esta' contacto' ya van a entende' lo que hace'
Aférrate a algo ten claro que es lo que hace' y no lo pierda' por lo que dice la gente ey
One two three have fun


Si me he dado cuenta de que todo esto es un show
Que es mentira lo que ellos cuentan nunca hay' quien te dé amor
Los que están a tu lado ayer decían que no
Y los de afuera los que no te conocen quieren' demostrá
Ahora viene el dinero abren la mano pa' saludarte
Y ellos son los que ma'niscan pa' que tú no puedas controlar
Se mueren de la envidia y quieren que tú te caigas
El triunfo y el dinero es lo que ellos quieren no que tú esté'


Yeh yeh yeh yeh
¿Quién será el siguiente pa' vestirme y que aparezca
¿Será Nike o alguien que quiera quedarse con mi marca y mi inversión
¿Será que ahora con' esta' contacto' ya van a entende' lo que hace'
Aférrate a algo ten claro que es lo que hace' y no lo pierda' por lo que dice la gente ey
One two three have fun


Si si tú quiere' le damo' bounce

Que mi pago pa' Bad Bunny nunca ha sido un bounce
En la calle' la' mama' con el bounce

Verse 1:
When I get stoned I get to thinkin' 'bout you
And where you might be and who you're with what you're up to
Your hair and your eyes girl the way they come together
Like a portrait of you burnt in my mind forever

And I ain't even gotta try it comes naturally
I swear I'm just being honest don't go changin' on me
You proof yeah you proof
Baby you proof

Verse 2:
When I'm rollin' round kickin' up dust and dirt roads
I catch myself shootin' through town aimin' for your road
Focused on you even though there are things that I should do
And babe it's them one track mind thoughts I've grown so accustomed to

Chorus:
And I ain't even gotta try it comes naturally
I swear I'm just being honest don't go changin' on me
You proof yeah you proof

La noche está pa' ti la noche está pa' mí oh-oh-oh
Bájate pa' acá no lo pienses más Huh

La noche está pa' ti la noche está pa' mí oh-oh-oh
Bájate pa' acá no lo pienses más
La noche está pa' ti la noche está pa' mí oh-oh-oh
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but
You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovingly
But I don't believe ya
You know I've been the one to take you
I'll lose you I'll lose you
Honey I I I
I can't make you happy now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but
You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovingly
'Cause you know I'll be the one to take you
I'll lose you I'll lose you
Honey I I I
I can't make you happy now
You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovingly
'Cause you know I'll be the one to take you
I'll lose you I'll lose you
Honey I I I
I can't make you happy oh no
I can't make you happy now
You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovingly
But I can't believe ya
You know I've been the one to take you
I'll lose you I'll lose you
Honey I I I
I can't make you happy now

Me porto bonito papi
Si nos vamo' en plan de bellaco' chingamo' Joaquín
En vez del enemigo siempre mi herma' mi rival
To' lo' cartel' premen menos el de PayPal
En primera fila como Viña del Mal
Los blanco' controlan aunque no se den cuenta e'
Yo estoy' en la gran liga tengo tengo y tengo smart e'
Siempre ando por encima de la merca
Y en la ex-penitenciaría hay guardia' a mi mercea
Tengo' un empresario que trae to' lo ecológico
Y trae un gimmick nuevo: te mata de asfixia con el cloro Ey; ey
En la prisión no le hacen vistita' a corrona
Los nota' me querían muerto y acá sigo de comisiona Ey; ey
¿Quién murió ¿Quién cojone' lo mató Ey; ey
Tio por cachitos y yales ¿tu me te vas' a matar con yo


Ya' sa' ya' sa' ya'
Ella quiere que la corone'
Y yo no toy' pa' eso bebeci'

No me compares con lo' que tá' rompiendo
Yo no juego' con mi' sentimiento' 'toy por la chav' dinero
Tú quiere' cosquilleo' a mí no me interesa
Yo toi' tranquilo en casa mientras tú ronca' a destajo
Los nota' e' amigable' pero e' bochinche
La droga un negocio igual que la mía
Pa' que hable de mí e' 'eleva'o y de ella humo'
A mí no me gusta la vaina de justiciero Batman
Yo ando 24/7 pa' la' net'
A puerta' clavá' como que cuando hago met'
La noche ma' latente que el día
Yo empecé trepando muro' y ahora en avión viajando
Todo el mundo pregunta que si te van a matar
Y yo le tiro: "Mijo ojalá"
Dicen que fui bendecido por Dios
Pero Sataná' no me suelta na'


Ya' sa' ya' sa' ya'
Ella quiere que la corone'
Y yo no toy' pa' eso bebeci'
Si tú quiere' que te haga el amor
Entonce' por Dior' pide y te lo doy
Pégate a la mí' yo te doy mami
Delicia de fantasía yo sé que te late
