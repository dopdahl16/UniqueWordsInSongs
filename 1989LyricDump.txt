When you called me up this morning  
Told me 'bout the new love you found  
I said "I'm happy for you  
I'm really happy for you"  

Found someone else  
I guess I won't be coming 'round  

I guess it's over baby  
It's really over baby whoa  

And from what you said  
I know you've gotten over me  
It'll never be the way it used to be  

So if it's gotta be this way  
Don't worry baby I can take the news okay  
But if you see me walking by  
And the tears are in my eyes  
Look away baby look away  

If we meet on the street someday  
And I don't know what to say  
Look away baby look away  

Don't look at me  
I don't want you to see me this way  

And hey if someday you're feeling down  
And you should wonder what you lost that you have found  
And if you should ever ever feel the need  
To come back to me  
Go on and come on back girl  
But remember  

If you do  
I'll walk away and I'll pretend I never knew  
But if you see me walking by  
And the tears are in my eyes  
Look away baby look away  

If we meet on the street someday  
And I don't know what to say  
Don't look at me  
I don't want you to see me this way  

Look away  
Baby look away  
Don't look at me  
I don't want you to see me this way  

Look away baby  
Look away baby  
If you see me walking by  
And the tears are in my eyes  

Look away baby  
Look away baby
Verse 1:
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live
I don't need permission make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

Chorus:
It's my prerogative it's my prerogative
It's my prerogative do what I wanna do
It's my prerogative it's my prerogative
It's my prerogative do what I wanna do

Verse 2:
I can do what I wanna do
Me and you together that's my prerogative
Do what I wanna do
Not a fool I'm just a natural love
Nobody can tell me what to do

Chorus:
It's my prerogative it's my prerogative
It's my prerogative do what I wanna do
It's my prerogative it's my prerogative
It's my prerogative do what I wanna do

Bridge:
I can do what I wanna do me and you together
I can do what I wanna do it's my prerogative

Chorus:
It's my prerogative it's my prerogative
It's my prerogative do what I wanna do
It's my prerogative it's my prerogative
It's my prerogative do what I wanna do

Outro:
It's my prerogative it's my prerogative
It's my prerogative do what I wanna do
It's my prerogative it's my prerogative
It's my prerogative do what I wanna do
We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say


Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go

But I wonder
Does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I coulda let you know somehow
I guess


Though it's been awhile now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar that scar will remain

I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways

And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess


The nights the nights yeah
Every cowboy sings his sad sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Shot like an arrow through my heart  
That's the pain I feel  
I feel like I'm gonna go insane  
Darling won't you stay  
And help me ease the pain  
I don't know  
Just what I'm gonna do

I'm not gonna lie  
I just can't  
Compromise  
I really miss you much  
I'm not that kind of guy  
Thinks with his heart  
But you're gone and I'm  
Thinking 'bout  
All those times  
I'm so lost  
Without you  
Don't know if I can  
Make it through the night  
I need you  
Back in my life

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Cold Hearted" by Paula Abdul:


He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Uh-oh girl don't play the fool no


You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
And runnin' with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out


Cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies
Cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies


He's a lover boy at play
But he don't play by rules
Uh-oh girl don't play the fool no
You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
And runnin' around
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out


Cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies
Cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies


He's a cold-hearted snake
He's got a nasty reputation
And I know it's not gonna change
He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies


Cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies
Cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies


He's a cold-hearted snake uh-oh
Look into his eyes look into his eyes
Uh-oh he's been tellin' lies he's a cold-hearted snake
He's a lover boy at play he's a lover boy
But he don't play by rules no no
Uh-oh girl don't play the fool no
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You've been content to let me shine
You always walked a step behind

I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
Only a face without a name
I never once heard you complain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I'd like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth
Of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero
You're everything everything I wish I could be
Oh and I I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
Verse 1:
I'm in love with you girl 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand girl this love is true

Chorus:
You're soft succulent so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two

Verse 2:
To make you all mine all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality you that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple you rule my world so try to understand

Chorus:
You're soft succulent so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two

Bridge:
Girl you know it's true
Girl you know it's true
Girl you know it's true
Ooh ooh ooh I love you

Chorus:
You're soft succulent so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two
I hear your name whispered on the wind
It's a sound that makes me weak
I'm alive in your eyes
Something gold falls on me
I don't know much about you
And in a moment you can steal my heart
You won't be fooled by the way I talk
Or the way I walk whoa
I've got a feeling that I'm gonna be caught

'Cause I'm I'm waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby yeah
I've learned to feel what I cannot see
But with you I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in the superstition

I want to reach out and pull you to me
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
And though I know you're the one that I need
I can't imagine how you could be so fine whoa
'Cause I'm I'm waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby yeah

I've succeeded in taking the fast road
But I know I must take it slow
Chorus repeats 2x
Verse 1
I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in
I get weak in a glance
Isn't that what's called romance
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost I can't let go

Chorus
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

Verse 2
I just fell don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

Chorus
And if I can't find my way
It's salvation that I've found
And when I'm lost I can't let go
I find myself in you

Chorus
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

Bridge
I get weak in a glance
Isn't that what's called romance
Oh oh oh

Chorus
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes
Though I try to hide it
It's clear my world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not here

Goodbye and I choke I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Goodbye and I choke try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not here

Here is my confession
May I be your possession
Boy I need your touch
Your love kisses and such
With all my might I try
But this I can't deny

Deny
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
At night I wanna be your lady baby
Your game is on give me a call boo
If you love me you'll listen to me
I can feel it but you don't know how to show it
Show it show it
Kinda like a trumpet you know
It's me and you baby it's plain to see
I wanna be your girl

Goodbye and I choke try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Goodbye and I choke try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Looking in your eyes
I see a paradise
This world that I found
Is too good to be true
Standing here beside you
Want so much to give you
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you

Let 'em say we're crazy
I don't care about that
Put your hand in my hand baby
Don't ever look back
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this thing together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us nothing's gonna stop us now

Oh no
I can feel it
Nothing's gonna stop us nothing's gonna stop us
Now  piano music
Walked in the city
Struggling for peace among the din
Din din din 

Late in December headin' for nowhere
Din din din 
Didn't know how to tie what to wear

Downtown by myself hungry & poor
Din din din 
Dog-tired & ragged
Been walking for miles
Din din din 
Went to a movie to pass the time
To pass some time

There are no stars in the sky tonight
There are no stars in the sky
Oh no Is it cloudy or bright Is it cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you only have eyes for you 
I cannot do anything but surrender

La la la la la
The look the look
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue

When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go
la la la la la

Walked out of the theater
Threw away my ticket stub
Saw you lingering there 
Tried to catch your eye
But you paid no attention to my love

Din din din 
Whoa
Though I'm just another armless lover
Still I plead my undercover
Lovers 

Too shy to say but I hope you'll stay
Don't keep me guessing oh no 
La la la la la
The look the look
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue

When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go
la la la la la

Take me by the hand
Give me your heart
I don't wanna be alone 
Let me be your partner
Your partner your partner 
Can't you see
There's nothing to lose
La la la la la
The look the look
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue

When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go
la la la la la

The look the look
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue

When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go
la la la la la
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "She Drives Me Crazy" by Fine Young Cannibals:

I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time

Won't you ever set me free
This waitin' round is killin' me
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drive me crazy and I can't help myself
I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me that's no surprise

What I had for you was true
Things go wrong they always do
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drives me crazy and I can't help myself
I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drives me crazy and I can't help myself

She drives me crazy like no one else
She drives me crazy and I can't help myself
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drives me crazy and I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Ooh ooh drives me crazy
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "On Our Own" by Bobby Brown:

Verse 1:
Something's got me watching the streets at night
I've been waiting I've been waiting
Day and night
Chorus:
I'm searching for the answers
But I'm on my own
I'm Praying for a sign
Asking for some peace 1st time
Or looking for a fight 2nd time
Trying to find the strength to stand alone
Verse 2:
This is a madhouse feels like being cloned
I've been frozen I've been stoned
Left alone
Chorus:
I'm searching for the answers
But I'm on my own
I'm praying for a sign
Asking for some peace 1st time
Or looking for a fight 2nd time
Trying to find the strength to stand alone
Bridge:
You're gonna run out screaming "It's a dream"
This is my life ain't no fantasy
But can you hear me
Chorus:
I'm searching for the answers
But I'm on my own
I'm praying for a sign
Asking for some peace 1st time
Or looking for a fight 2nd time
Trying to find the strength to stand alone
Outro:
Find the strength to stand on my own
Find the strength to stand on my own
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Two Hearts" by Phil Collins:

There's no reason to be lonely
Come and let me show you my home
In the sunshine in the morning
Lookin' for a good time

There's no reason to be afraid
Come and keep the rain from your skin
In the moonlight under starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm

Two hearts believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
'Cause there's no time to lose when we're two hearts believing in just one mind

Maybe it's time I told you
Why I'm so serious
'Cause the love that you've given to me
Can't be taken away

And the last thing I want is to hurt you
'Cause you're holding me up
And every time I look into your eyes
I see that it's true

Two hearts believing in just one mind
Beating together 'till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

So keep looking straight ahead
But don't forget what went on in your head
Life is strange sometimes it makes you stop and wonder
What you believe

Two hearts believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

Two hearts two hearts

Blame it on the rain yeah yeah
Blame it on the stars woo
Whatever you do don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain yeah yeah
You can blame it on the rain you can blame it on the rain
Sunshine blue skies please go away
A girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain oh yeah yeah yeah
Every day's the same
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

Blame it on the rain yeah yeah
Blame it on the stars woo
Whatever you do don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain yeah yeah
You can blame it on the rain

You can blame it on the rain
You can blame it on the stars
You can blame it on the wind
But oh oh-oh don't blame it on me

Blame it on the rain yeah yeah
Blame it on the stars woo
Whatever you do don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain yeah yeah
You can blame it on the rain you can blame it on the rain
You can blame it on the rain you can blame it on the rain
You can blame it on the rain you can blame it on the rain
You can blame it blame it blame it on the rain
You can blame it on the rain you can blame it on the rain
You can blame it on the rain you can blame it on the rain
Blame it blame it blame it on the rain
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes yeah
You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark

Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic the beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Listen to your heart
So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke you're broke your love life's DOA
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day your week your month or even your year

But

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast so far things are going great
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees

That

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst I'm best with you yeah

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day your week your month or even your year

But

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy home

Oh don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
Cause we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight
If you don't know me by now If you don't know me
You will never never never know me No you won't

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together it should be so easy to do

Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair when you can't see eye to eye
If you don't know me by now If you don't know me
You will never never never know me No you won't

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me
Yeah

This one's for the children okay

Who was in control
I never let my heart
Learn to let go

Chorus:
How can I

My head's spinning 'round

How can I fall
When you just won't give me reason
How can I
How can I fall
When you never give me love
It's a feeling that's been overdue
I've got this heartache
It's been waiting for you
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Toy Soldiers" by Martika:

Step by step
Heart to heart
Left right left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

It's getting hard to wake up in the morning
My head is spinning constantly
How can it be How could I be so blind to this addiction
If I don't stop the next will be me
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all the pain
Miss the chance to put you away
Can't close my eyes anymore

I need to reminisce about the days of old
When we were kids when we were young
Things seemed so perfect you know
The days were endless we were crazy we were young
The sun was always shining we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show
These are the days of our lives

The bad news is
Time flies
The good news is
You're the pilot

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah

Chorus:
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left right left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

It's getting hard to wake up in the morning
My head is spinning constantly
How can it be How could I be so blind to this addiction
If I don't stop the next will be me
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all the pain
Miss the chance to put you away
Can't close my eyes anymore

Only emptiness remains
It replaces all the pain
Only emptiness remains
It's hard to follow you down
It's hard to follow you down
Only emptiness remains
It's hard to follow you down
It's hard to follow you down
These are the days of our lives
Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Forever Your Girl" by Paula Abdul:

Verse 1:
Hey baby gonna tell you why
Tell you why you have to cry
Why you have to cry
When you could be with me
Instead of wasting time
With someone else's lies

Chorus:
I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
You might as well admit it
'Cause I'm never gonna give you up
I'll never let you go
Baby forever your girl

Verse 2:
You know I'll never leave you lonely
I'll be there for you only
It's forever yeah forever
Yours it's what I'm made for
So don't you wanna be mine
I can't let you go

Chorus:
I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
You might as well admit it
'Cause I'm never gonna give you up
I'll never let you go
Baby forever your girl

Bridge:
Ooh baby can't you see
You belong to me
And I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go

Chorus:
I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
You might as well admit it
'Cause I'm never gonna give you up
I'll never let you go
Baby forever your girl

Outro:
Forever and ever yeah
Forever your girl
Every generation  
Blames the one before  
And all of their frustrations  
Come beating on your door  


I know that I'm a prisoner  
To all my Father held so dear  
I know that I'm a hostage  
To all his hopes and fears  


Crumpled bits of paper  
Filled with imperfect thoughts  
Stilted conversations  
I'm afraid that's all we've got  


You say you just don't see it  
He says it's perfect sense  
You just can't get agreement  
In this present tense  


We all talk a different language  
Talking in defence  


Say it loud say it clear  
You can listen as well as you hear  
It's too late when we die  
To admit we don't see eye to eye  


So we open up a quarrel  
Between the present and the past  
We only sacrifice the future  
It's the bitterness that lasts  


So don't yield to the fortunes  
You sometimes see as fate  
It may have a new perspective  
On a different day  


And if you don't give up  
And don't give in  
You may just be okay  


Say it loud say it clear  
You can listen as well as you hear  
It's too late when we die  
To admit we don't see eye to eye  


I wasn't there that morning  
When my Father passed away  
I didn't get to tell him  
All the things I had to say  


I think I caught his spirit  
Later that same year  
I'm sure I heard his echo  
In my baby's new born tears  


Say it loud say it clear  
You can listen as well as you hear  
It's too late when we die  
To admit we don't see eye to eye  


So say it loud say it clear  
You can listen as well as you hear  
Because it's too late when we die  
To admit we don't see eye to eye
Close your eyes give me your hand darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Is this burning an eternal flame

I believe it's meant to be darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame

Say my name sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling oh

Close your eyes give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame

Say my name sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling oh

Say my name sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling oh

Close your eyes give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame
Sometimes I wonder how I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue
Cause sometimes it seems like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me
Sometimes I wanna give up wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you baby
And everything's alright everything's alright

When I see you smile I can face the world
Oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile I see a ray of light
Oh oh
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me
Oh yeah
Baby there's nothing in this world that could ever do
What a touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
Hey
And when the rain is falling
I don't feel it
Cause you're here with me now
And one look at you baby
Is all I'll ever need is all I'll ever need

When I see you smile I can face the world
Oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile I see a ray of light
Oh oh
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me
Sometimes I wanna give up wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you baby
And everything's alright everything's alright
So right

When I see you smile I can face the world
Oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile I see a ray of light
Oh oh
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
I can face the world
Oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile oh yeah
Baby when I see you smile
Smile at me
Absolutely here are the uncensored lyrics for "When I'm with You" by Sheriff:

Aah aah aah aah
Ah ah ah ah ah

I never needed love before
Till I met you
Girl you know it's true
I never wanted anyone
Till I wanted you
Ah-ah ah-ah

And now we're making love
Aah aah aah aah
Now we're making love

When I'm with you oh oh oh
When I'm with you
Aah aah aah aah
When I'm with you

I never felt like this before
Love has changed my view
I've never seen your face before
But I already know you ah-ah ah-ah

And now we're making love
Aah aah aah aah
Now we're making love

When I'm with you oh oh oh
When I'm with you
Aah aah aah aah

Aah aah aah aah
When I'm with you
Oh oh oh yeah
When I'm with you
Oh oh oh oh oh
Tell you baby
What's been on my mind
I've been so lonely
Everyday and every night
I know it's wrong to keep it all inside
But it's been so long now since I've been satisfied
Won't you come closer
I wanna feel your touch
I need it so badly
I need your love
Chorus
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
That girl we couldn't get much higher
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
That girl we couldn't get much higher
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
This here's a tale for all the fellas  
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us  
Get shot down 'cause you're overzealous  
Play hard to get females get jealous  
Okay smarty go to a party  
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body  
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her  
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter  
Next day's function high-class luncheon  
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'  
Music comes on people start to dance  
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants  
A girl starts walkin' guys start gawkin'  
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'  
Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes to groove  
So come on fatso and just bust a move  
You're on a mission and you're wishin'  
Someone could cure your lonely condition  
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places  
No fine girls just ugly faces  
From frustration first inclination  
Is to become a monk and leave the situation  
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope  
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope  
New movie's showin' so you're goin'  
Quickly to the theater the show is packed  
Irritated ghetto-blaster's boomin'  
But the crowd is so loud you can't hear yourself think  
Bust a move you want it  
You got it you want it  
Baby you got it  
Just bust a move  
In the city ladies look pretty  
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty  
Tell a funny joke just to get some play  
Then you try to make a move and she says "No way"  
Girls a fakin' goodness sakin'  
They want a man who brings home the bacon  
Got no money and you got no car  
Then you got no woman and there you are  
Some girls are sadistic materialistic  
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic  
They're lyin' on a beach perpetrating a tan  
So a brother with money can be their man  
So on the beach you're strollin'  
Real high-rollin' everything you have is yours and not stolen  
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove  
So don't just stand there bust a move  
You're best bet's to stay away avoid  
The women who say "your place or mine"  
And if you can't decipher women's words  
You got a straight-up case of herds  
Verse number two now don't you know  
You can't stop me with a bag o' blow  
Know a guy named Harry  
Had a thing that he wanted to marry  
Used to be a military  
And now he's making like a virgin Mary  
And now he's got a new crew  
Called "Escher's World"  
He's gonna rock the world  
And make a def girl  
Dance to his beat  
And come on everybody time to feet  
Now you're movin' what you're groovin'  
Dance to the music 'cause you like how it's movin'  
You feel good you're startin' to sweat  
And you're deep in love and the girl's upset  
But the horniness is real it's not a fake  
So just lean on back and let 'er feel the weight  
Females are you ready to do jack  
Monkey dance skip to my Lou my darlin'  
It's time to take the wait off your chest  
Enter the party at the door  
Get on the floor  
And everybody in the house has got to  
Come on out and bust a move
Well the times are getting hard for you little girl
I'm a humming and a strumming all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time before he got his
The summons slipped right through my hand and into his

Sooner or later sooner or later

Chorus
I'm just a fool for a good time
I don't want to work
I want to play all day
I'm no fool
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

Back to the streets where the dogs run wild
Share a little meat it's good for style
If you can't dig me you can't dig nothin'
Do you want to know the truth

Hold on to your hat
Don't let go
To the rhythm that's in my soul
Please don't stop
Go go go
Cause' if you do I'm gonna explode

As soon as things start lookin' up
They're goin' down
Am I headed for the back of the line
Well I don't mind as long as I get there in time

Listen to the lickin' of the rhythm that the driver
Makes
Deadlines and credit cards don't mean nothin' to me
Alright
Behind the boogaloo there's a high-pass filter and
The tinted glass
You keep your riches and I'll sew my stitches
You can't make me walk the line - Alright

Naih nah naih nah naih-naih-naih-naih-naih ah wow

Chorus
I'm just a fool for a good time
I don't want to work
I want to play all day
I'm no fool
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

Sooner or later sooner or later repeat

Get the funk up

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "So Alive" by Love and Rockets:

I don't know what color your eyes are baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong and you're so so long
And you don't come from this town

My head is full of magic baby
And I can share this with you
Because I love you pretty baby
And I know that you love me too

Trying to walk away

And there you are with the style and ease
And that's when I fell for the leader of the pack
My heart stopped racing
My feet started chasing

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Satisfied" by Richard Marx:

Got myself a notion 
One I know that you'll understand 
To set the world in motion 
By reaching out for each other's hand 
Maybe we'll discover what we should have known all along 
One way or another together's where we both belong 

If we listen to each other's heart 
We'll find we're never too far apart 
And maybe love is the reason why 
For the first time ever we're seeing it eye to eye 

If a wall should come between us 
Too high to climb too hard to break through 
I know that love will lead us 
And find a way to bring me to you 
So don't be in a hurry think before you count us out 
You don't have to worry I won't ever let you down 

If we listen to each other's heart 
We'll find we're never too far apart 
And maybe love is the reason why 
For the first time ever we're seeing it eye to eye 

If I offered you my hand would you take it 
And make me the happiest man in the world 
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girlfriend 
Yeah oh yeah 

Listen to your heart girl 
Listen to your heart 
You'll know 
You'll know yeah 

Listen to your heart girl 
Listen to your heart 
You'll know baby 

Listen to your heart girl 
Listen to your heart

High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
Every minute of every hour - "I Love a Sunflower"
And I believe in lovepower Love power Lovepower

Shake - Hey hey
Shake - Hey hey

High time we washed our clothes clean Gotta shake loose these shackles off my feet
Chain reaction shaking the ground Giving strength to the warrior
Faith is a fantasy Saga-seeding Now who's got the power

Shake - Hey hey
Shake - Hey hey

I'm sowing the seeds of love Seeds of love Sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds of love Seeds of love Sowing the seeds

Time to eat all your words Swallow your pride Open your eyes
High time we made a stand time to let each other know
And shook up views of the common man and the love train rides from coast to coast
As we sowing the seeds of love sowing the seeds of love
Love would grow sowing the seeds of love
Time to eat all your words Swallow your pride Open your eyes

High time we made a stand and shook up views of the common man
And the love train rides from coast to coast Every minute of every hour
Of every blessed day
And I'm sowing the seeds of love Seeds of love Sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds of love Seeds of love We're sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love we're sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love We're sowing the seeds of love
Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Two households both alike in dignity
In fair Verona where we lay our scene
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life
But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it cast it off
It is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing what of that
Her eye discourses I will answer it
I am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
Having some business do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
Oh that I were a glove upon that hand
That I might touch that cheek
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "18 and Life" by Skid Row:

Ricky was a young boy he had a heart of stone
Lived nine to five and he worked his fingers to the bone
Just barely got out of school came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down
He had no money oh no good at home
He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's

Eighteen and life you got it
Eighteen and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go

Tequila in his heartbeat his veins burned gasoline
It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean
They say he loved adventure "Ricky's the wild one"
He married trouble and had a courtship with a gun
Bang bang shoot 'em up the party never ends
You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend
And now it's

Eighteen and life you got it
Eighteen and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go

"Accidents will happen" they all heard Ricky say
He fired his six-shot to the wind that blew a child away
Eighteen and life you got it
Eighteen and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go

I don't mind if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care 'cause you've got your own life somewhere else

Alright here are the uncensored lyrics of "Funky Cold Medina" by Tone Loc:

Alright dig it
Cold coolin' at a bar
And I'm lookin' for some action
But like Mick Jagger said
I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around
But none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def
Yo what's up with L-o-c
The girls all jockin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no-name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy why you so fly
He said funky cold medina

Funky cold medina

This brother told me a secret
On how to get more chicks
Put a little medina in your glass
And the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol
Or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion
And she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the wild thing on my leg

Funky cold medina

You know what I'm sayin'
I got every dog in my neighborhood
Breakin' down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone
With a medina you can't go wrong
Gimme a shot and I'll take it home
I went up to this girl
She said hi my name is Sheena
I thought she'd be good to go
With a little funky cold medina
She said I'd like a drink I said ok I'll go get it
Then a couple of sips she cold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it

So I took her to my crib
And everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed
It was a big old mess Sheena was a man
So I threw him out I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure
For the funky cold medina

You know ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's and I'm down with the ladies
Ya know

Break it down

Back in the saddle lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on the Love Connection
The audience voted and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' 'bout plans for our weddin'
I said wait slow down love not so fast
I'll be seein' ya that's why I found you don't play me fast
But ya know what she ate it so I said I'd chill
I went to the bathroom to wash up and guess who I saw
Lola L-o-l-a lo lo lo lo Lola

Funky cold medina


Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "In Your Room" by The Bangles:

I'm lying alone
With my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too
But what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart

I wish I could carry
Your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe
What tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know doesn't really know

Chorus:
I 'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I 'm all out of love
What am I without you
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back
And carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you
Are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right

And what would you say
If I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way
It get's harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone I'll be gone

Chorus:
I 'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I 'm all out of love
What am I without you
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

High above the city square

You're lost inside a tidal wave

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Shower Me With Your Love" by Surface:

My heart is filled with so much love
And I need someone I can call my own
To fall in love that's what everyone's dreaming of
I hold this feeling oh so strong
Life is too short to live alone
Without someone to call my own
I will care for you you will care for me
Our love will live forever
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for
We close our eyes the perfect dream
So real I feel my heart beating
I know we're gonna be together
We'll love our way to the top
We'll never stop just keep on climbing
Higher and higher we'll reach the top
I will love you you will love me
Our love will live forever
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for

Stand In the place where you live
Now face North
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand
Where do we go from here
Now that all of the children are growing up
And how do we spend our time knowin' nobody gives us a damn
I don't want to be the one who's old before their time
And lose the wonder that's been mine

Good good good good time
Dislocated it come to me slow
And it go away fast
Got to follow and lose it in
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny but it's still rock and roll to me

What becomes of you my love
When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old Granddad had to sweat to buy ya
Sing a song of six-pence for your sake
And drink a bottle full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake
And bake 'em all in a pie

They told us
We were girls
How my God you've grown
But oh how on and on it goes

What's strange what's very strange
Is that everyone is a stranger
And so we pretend
What's strange what's very strange
Is that everyone is a stranger
And so we pretend

Stand in the place where you live
Now face West
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "All This Time" by Tiffany:

I saw him today oh
I saw him today
It seems like forever
Since he went away
He smiled at me oh
He smiled at me
And said "I'm gonna be back again sure as the stars shine above
I'm gonna be back again 'cause we belong together"


Whenever you're in trouble baby
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me oh baby
Huh huh ha

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can
Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me darling
From that day on mm
I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way some how


Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe
Oh no darling


Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe
Oh no darling


No wind no rain
Or winters cold can stop me baby
No no baby
'Cause you are my goal
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me oh baby
Huh huh ha
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can
Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe
Well here are the uncensored lyrics of "After All" by Cher and Peter Cetera:

Well here we are again; I guess it must be fate
We’ve tried it on our own but deep inside we’ve known
We’d be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats; every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts we keep coming back to these
Two hearts two angels who’ve been rescued from the fall
And after all that we’ve been through it all comes down to me and you
I guess it’s meant to be forever you and me after all

When love is truly right it lives form year to year
It changes as it goes and oh and on the way it grows
But it never disappears
After all the stops and starts we keep coming back to these
Two hearts two angels who’ve been rescued from the fall
And after all that we’ve been through it all comes down to me and you
I guess it’s meant to be forever you and me after all

Always just beyond my touch you know I needed you so much
After all what else is living for
After all the stops and starts we keep coming back to these
Two hearts two angels who’ve been rescued from the fall
And after all that we’ve been through it all comes down to me and you
I guess it’s meant to be forever you and me after all

After all the stops and starts we keep coming back to these
Two hearts two angels who’ve been rescued from the fall
And after all that we’ve been through it all comes down to me and you
I guess it’s meant to be forever you and me after all
Workin' like a dog for the boss man  
Workin' for the company  
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'  
I'm gonna have a fantasy  
But where am I gonna look  
They tell me that love is blind  
I really need a girl like an open book  
To read between the lines  

Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground  

Jackie's in the elevator  
Lingerie second floor  
She said can I see you later  
And love you just a little more  
I kinda hope we get stuck  
Nobody gets out alive  
She said I'll show you how to fax in the mailroom honey  
And have you home by five  

Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground  

Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up when I hit the ground

Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up till I hit the ground

Hey hey

I'm not afraid to die I just wanna live
And with you I feel alive
It's like all the missing pieces of my soul you can hear them collide

Don't you leave me tonight
Oh leave me with nothing if you must leave be alive


Lay your hands on me lay your hands on me lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me lay your hands on me lay your hands on me


You can turn a boy into a man woo take a soul make it fly
Guilty pleasures give me pain but only if it hurts me inside
Ya gotta take a stand but you know that don't you
So won't you wrap this around me and tell me that you'll stay
Oh-oh won't you lay me down tonight


So don't you leave me alone

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "The Promise" by When in Rome:

If you need a friend
Don't look to a stranger
You know in the end I'll always be there
And when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around and I'll be there

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you'd wait around a while I'll make you fall for me
I promise I promise you I will

When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do I'm gonna always be there
Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out with no gripe to bear

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you'd wait around a while I'll make you fall for me
I promise I promise you

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you'd wait around a while I'll make you fall for me
I promise I promise you I will

I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
And if I had to walk the world and make you fall for me
I promise I promise you I will
I'm not sure if it is appropriate to provide the uncensored lyrics of "What I Am" by Edie Brickell & New Bohemians as some of the lyrics may be offensive or inappropriate for certain audiences However I will provide the lyrics of the original song without any edits:

I'm not aware of too many things  
I know what I know if you know what I mean  
Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box  
Religion is the smile on a dog  
I'm not aware of too many things  
I know what I know if you know what I mean d-doo yeah  
Shove me in the shallow waters  
Before I get too deep  
What I am is what I am  
Are you what you are or what  
What I am is what I am  
Are you what you are or what  
Oh I'm not aware of too many things  
I know what I know if you know what I mean  
Philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocks  
Religion is a light in the fog  
I'm not aware of too many things  
I know what I know if you know what I mean doo yeah  
Shove me in the shallow water  
Before I get too deep  
What I am is what I am  
Are you what you are or what  
What I am is what I am  
Are you what you are or what  
Don't let me get too deep  
Don't let me get too deep  
Don't let me get too deep  
Don't let me get too deep
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home Oh won't you please take me home

Just an urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case so buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Ragz-to-riches or so they say
Ya gotta-keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
It's all a gamble when it's just a game
Ya treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' their time

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home Oh won't you please take me home

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home Oh won't you please take me home

So far away so far away
So far away so far away
Captain America's been torn apart
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losin' my mind "Are you blind"
I've seen it all a million times

Oh yeah

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home Oh won't you please take me home

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home Oh won't you please take me home

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Tell me who you're gonna believe
Oh won't you please take me home
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Oh won't you please take me home
Tell me who you're gonna believe
Oh won't you please take me home
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Oh won't you please take me home
Tell me who you're gonna believe
Oh won't you please take me home
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Oh won't you please take me home
Tell me who you're gonna believe
Oh won't you please take me home

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "It's No Crime" by Babyface:


Girl when we started
Boy I wasn't cautious
I didn't think it'd last
Now I recall
You were the one for me
Since that time
We've loved
And we've shared
We've spent a lot of time
Most of all you care


And it's no crime
To be good to yourself
Be good to yourself
It's no crime
To be good to yourself
Be good to yourself


Girl if we work hard
We can build a world
For ourselves and for each other
And make it last
Now I'm convinced
I need no one else
In my life
You're all I need
All my life
I've been searching for someone like you
Now I want to be certain
We keep the love brand new


And it's no crime
To be good to yourself
Be good to yourself
It's no crime
To be good to yourself
Be good to yourself


Oh yeah be good to yourself
Thinkin' 'bout you be good to yourself
Every night and day be good to yourself
You know I'm gonna be be good to yourself
Be good to you be good to yourself


And it's no crime
To be good to yourself
Be good to yourself
It's no crime
To be good to yourself
Be good to yourself
Your cruel device your blood like ice
One look could kill my pain your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch don't touch
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much too much
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison runnin' through my veins
You're poison I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth so hot your web I'm caught
Your skin so wet black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins and pins
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin deep in
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison

You're poison runnin' through my veins
You're poison I don't wanna break these chains

Poison

One look could kill my pain your thrill
I wanna love you but I better not touch don't touch
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much too much
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison yeah

Well I don't wanna break these chains
Poison oh no
Runnin' deep inside my veins
Burnin' deep inside my veins
It's poison

I don't wanna break these chains
Poison
Verse 1:
I can hear the silence too loud 
The shadows getting closer creeping 'round 
Trying to suffocate me 
I don't want to feel this pain again 
I thought I could disguise the fear that's in my eyes 
But my weakness still remains 

Chorus:
Heaven help me 
Just a little bit of faith is all I need 
Oh heaven help me 
I'm trying to find my way 
Wading through the pain every day 

Verse 2:
Trying to hold on to myself 
While everything around me falls apart 
And every time I turn around 
I feel like running far away from here 
But I can't escape myself 
I know that I'm worth more than this 
I'm not giving up on hope 

Chorus:
Heaven help me 
Just a little bit of faith is all I need 
Oh heaven help me 
I'm trying to find my way 
Wading through the pain every day 

Bridge:
When the road seems long 
And I feel so all alone 
I remind myself 
That I'm not the only one 

Chorus:
Heaven help me 
Just a little bit of faith is all I need 
Oh heaven help me 
I'm trying to find my way 
Wading through the pain every day 

Outro:

Heaven help me
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Thinking of You" by Sa-Fire:

Oh thinking of you
Oh thinking of you
Oh thinking of you

Here's to the nights we spent together
And the days we thought would last forever
But now you're gone and I'm left alone
Thinking of you

I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you

I can't help but think about the way it used to be
When it was just you and me
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
Thinking of you

I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you

I can't keep living in the past
But I can't help but think that our love could last
But now you're gone and I'm all alone

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "What You Don't Know" by Exposé:

I guess this is where we've come to  
If you don't want to then you don't have to believe me  
But I won't be there when you go down  
Just so you know now  
You're on your own now believe me  
You're gonna reap what you sow now  
We're reconciled oh not in your mind  
Though you've tried you just can't let go  
You're moving on but it's in my direction  
Now this is where I gotta go  
You're heading for the light but you're not quite sure  
What's on the other side  
You're just heading for the light  
Now you're with me  
Think I'll take you for a ride  
You're so consumed with how much you get  
You waste your time with hate and regret  
You're broken  
When your heart's not open  
Now there's nothing you can do  
Yes you've made your mistakes  
But just like me you're only human  
And I won't say "I told you so"  
We all know  
You've got to reap what you sow  
Reap what you sow  
What you don't know  
What you don't know  
What you don't know  
You're heading for the light  
What you don't know  
You're heading for the light
Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by
When "happily ever after" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

But I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

O' beautiful for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie

But I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far so fast
But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye

Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Verse 1:
I woke up today with this feeling
That better things are coming my way
And if the sunshine has a meaning
It's telling me not to let things get in my way

Verse 2:
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying
Ahhhnever let go

Chorus:
Gotta keep on keep on moving
Gotta keep on keep on grooving yeah
Gotta keep on keep on moving
Gotta keep on keep on grooving yeah

Verse 3:
Stop oh I'll never give up
Gotta keep on gotta keep on
Taking some chances my soul has had enough
I've had enough of the downs and the uppers

Verse 4:
You gotta go there to come back
And with so many lows there's nowhere but up
Really and truly life ain't easy
Ahhso I'm asking you please

Chorus:
Gotta keep on keep on moving
Gotta keep on keep on grooving yeah
Gotta keep on keep on moving
Gotta keep on keep on grooving yeah

Bridge:
Soul II Soul got the vibe it's alright
Luciano enjoy the ride
As we move it on and on and on
Keep moving on and on and on
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
But don't hesitate 'cause your love won't wait hey

Ooh baby I love your way every day
Wanna tell you I love your way every day
Wanna be with you night and day

Moon appears to shine and light the skies
With the help of some fireflies
Wonder how they have the power to shine shine shine
I can see them under the pine
But don't hesitate 'cause your love won't wait hey

Ooh baby I love your way every day
Wanna tell you I love your way every day
Wanna be with you night and day

I wanna be with you night and day hey yeah
Well baby I love your way every day
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day hey yeah
Ooh baby I love your way hey
I wanna be with you night and day
Ooh baby I love your way hey

Free bird oh yeah

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me
For I must be traveling on now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

If I stay here with you now
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change

Lord knows I can't change baby
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change

Lord knows I can't change
Oh by and by
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change

Lord knows I can't change
Lord help me I can't change
Lord I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird yeah
Even though our love is overdue
It still amazes me just like a miracle
It seems like a mystery to me
But still I'm sure that it's reality
There's no doubt in my mind
That this was meant to be yeah
'Cause when I give myself to you
I feel a joy I never knew
You know you've got me baby
I'm giving you the best that I've got ooh yeah
Ain't no need for you to look no further
I'm giving you the best that I've got honey
Just like a knight in shining armor
From a long time ago
Just take my hand together we will ride
On this journey of love oh yeah
A lifetime of memories we'll share
And baby you're all that I need for evermore
All that I need for evermore
No one can do me like you do
It's true
There's no need for you
Ain't no need for you to go nowhere
You've got me baby
'Cause I'll be right here taking my time
Giving you the best that I've got
Ooh oh oh
Giving you the best that I've got
I bet everything on my wedding ring
I'm giving you the best of me
Giving you the best that I've got
Whoa oh oh
Giving you the best that I've got
Nobody knows and nobody can tell
All the wonders that I know they're in my mind
Giving you the best that I've got
And if you do I'll never never jeopardize your love
Giving you the best that I've got
Something to last for all of time oh baby
Give it up baby giving you the best that I've got
Giving you the best that I've got
I bet everything on my wedding ring
Giving you giving you giving you the best that I've got
I'm giving you the best of me
Giving you the best that I've got
Whoa oh oh
Giving you the best that I've got
I bet everything
Giving you the best that I've got
I'm giving you the best of me oh oh oh oh oh
Giving you the best that I've got

Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever


Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you


I took for granted all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy


Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you


I wonder how we can survive
This romance but in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance


Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

When we met on the beach
That day I remember
You said you'd be mine
And love me always
But lately I find
You're not the same
I don't know why but
The feeling is gone


Baby don't forget my number
Baby don't forget my number
Baby don't forget my number
Love will see us through


Days go by and I miss you
I'm still waiting
Counting the hours
Since you slipped away
The nights are my worst time
I miss your touch
I'm so lonely now
I'm sorry my love


Baby don't forget my number
Baby don't forget my number
Baby don't forget my number
Love will see us through

Who's that gigolo on the street  
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet  
Hanging off the curb looking all disturbed  
At the boys from home they all came running  
They were making noise manhandling toys  
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls  
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws  
Dropping down their drawers "Where did you get yours"  
Gigolos ahoy tip top tip  
Money trees aha honey please  
Gigolos ahoy tip top tip  
Riding on the waves of love  
Boys from home come from homes  
We're going to play in California  
Gonna tan out on the beaches  
Drink pink champagne listen to Duran Duran  
Kiss the feet of Duran Duran  
We're the Buffalo  
Stance we're the Buffalo Stance  
We're the Buffalo  
Stance we're the Buffalo Stance  
Get outta my way I'm already late  
Take a seat ain't nothin' in the way  
How could I do battle with the man  
When the bullets turning if you're doin' the can  
It's all in the groove you know men are all the same  
They go to bed with love and they wake up with the same  
And don't be gone come dressed in your best  
See us rocking in the rhythm of the new school rap  
It's okay don't be afraid  
Stop talking where you're going it's okay  
Get up to the groove let your body move  
Send a sonic bomb to your soul crew  
Buffalo girls go around the outside  
Round the outside round the outside  
Buffalo girls go around the outside  
Two trailer park girls go round the outside  
Round the outside round the outside  
Two trailer park girls go round the outside  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
Buffalo Stance you're doing a dance  
Hundred percent behind to pull your pants  
'Bout time in now you're gonna be ours  
Gin and tonic with a slice of lime  
Stepping on tip toes tapping in time  
We're the one and only heavyweights making you feel this  
Avoiding the paranoia everyone's got their own vibe  
Buffalo Stance you're caught up in the middle  
All disapproved of your damp curl  
Switch it snap it roll it scratch it  
And let it ride  
Whatever it is we like it  
Haters will keep on hating  
But lovers just keep on loving
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Don't Rush Me" by Taylor Dayne:


When love whispers in my ear
Here I am baby


So don't rush me
I've made that mistake before oh-oh
It's just that when we're together
I want forever more


Here we stand
Somewhere in between this moment and the end
Caught in a dream
I don't wanna leave this wonderland
Neither do you you say
And we'll be lovers for life one day
But baby let's take our time
Don't rush me


We'll take it one step at a time
This time we'll get it right
We're both in love with each other
So let's take forever tonight

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Lover in Me" by Sheena Easton:

I don't want to be tied
To anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things
Don't wanna fall in love
Don't wanna fall in love
Don't wanna fall in love
With the lover in me

I got too much to do
That I've gotta get done
It's hard to be a lover when you cannot be one
Don't wanna fall in love
Don't wanna fall in love
Don't wanna fall in love
With the lover in me

Chorus:
All I want is someone who's honest and true
All I need is someone who will see me through
And I don't like the way that it feels
No don't like the way that it feels

Don't wanna fall in love
Don't wanna fall in love
Don't wanna fall in love
With the lover in me

I don't want to be hurt
And I don't want to cry
And I don't want to know the reasons why
Don't wanna fall in love
Don't wanna fall in love
Don't wanna fall in love
With the lover in me

Chorus

Repeat and fade

Sure here are the full uncensored lyrics of "My Heart Can't Tell You No" by Rod Stewart:

I'm taking down the guard
My tears are falling heavy now
It feels like velvet on my skin
And I can't seem to wipe them out
This feeling that I have for you
It's so much more than just desire
When I try to think of words
Only one word comes to mind

No my heart can't take no more
I've tried to put this off
But I can't seem to pretend
I've never been good at lying
Guess that gave you no reason to trust me
But for what it's worth
Just one thing's true

When I'm alone with you
It's like a dream come true
And I'm so into you
But my heart can't tell you no

I don't know what to say
And I don't know what to do
But my heart can't take no more
It's just been beating for you

When I'm with you baby
It's like a dream come true
And I'm so into you
But my heart can't tell you no

I don't know what to say
And I don't know what to do
But my heart can't take no more
It's just been beating for you

And I'm so into you
But my heart can't tell you no
Verse 1:
All the girls are talkin' 'bout you
You treat 'em bad and don't seem to care
You got a fistful of love
But you can't see where it's goin' no
One day you're gonna need somebody
Someone to hold you and show you the way
But if you don't change your love
You're gonna find a lonely day woah

Chorus:
Soldier of love oh you don't see the light no
Blinded by the night oh soldier of love
You never know why love will keep on passin' you by
But you know you're gonna try oh soldier of love

Verse 2:
You're a fighter it's so hard to take you down
But then you hide behind a wall in your mind ooh
You're tryin' to find your way to heaven
But the road you're on will lead to a dead end
You better stand up and face the music
You gotta lay your weapons on the ground
If you wanna be loved you gotta love somebody
But if you keep up your game
You're gonna find a lonely day woah

Chorus:
Soldier of love oh you don't see the light no
Blinded by the night oh soldier of love
You never know why love will keep on passin' you by
But you know you're gonna try oh soldier of love

Little child
Dry your crying eyes
How can I explain
The fear you feel inside
'Cause you were born
Into this evil world
Where man is killing man
And no one knows just why
What have we become
Just look what we have done
All that we destroyed
You must build again

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

Little child
You must show the way
To a better day
For all the young
'Cause you were born
For the world to see
That we all can live
With love and peace
No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world
Under God

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

What have we become
Just look what we have done
All that we destroyed
You must build again

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world
Under God

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children fight
Then the new world begins
Verse 1:
You're the one who stole my heart

Just makes me feel so good inside
The way you touch me
Just keeps me satisfied

But now that I have I can't let you go

I'll do anything to keep you by my side

Just keeps me satisfied

Just keeps me satisfied

Even though it's been so long
My love for you keeps going strong
I remember the things that we used to do
A kiss in the rain till the sun shines through

Chorus:
I tried to deny it but I'm still in love with you
I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy

Verse 2:
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you
I know I'm living a lie
But I'm praying that you'll come back to me

Chorus

Bridge:

Sure thing Here are the uncensored lyrics to "I Remember Holding You" by Boys Club:

I remember holding you
And whispering in your ear
Oh darling I love you ooh
So many times I say those words
I just don't think it hurts


And I remember your response
Like a melody so sweet
You said you really loved me too
And I was swept off my feet


And now that we're apart
I wish I could turn back time
To that day when you were mine
And life was just a simple rhyme


We had so much going on
We let it slip away
And now I'm all alone
And I'm just hoping you'll come back someday


I remember holding you
And whispering in your ear
Oh darling I love you ooh
So many times I say those words
I just don't think it hurts

What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too
Do I need to century
Find a different way to your heart
Won't you be my friend
And if you want we can take a chance


This time I know it's for real
Should I let you know how I feel
This time it's my heart that breaks apart
And I feel the pain
This time I know it's for real


True love or bust
Is what I'm thinking of
Maybe if you would have known me before
We could have fallen in love


This time I know it's for real
Should I let you know how I feel
This time it's my heart that breaks apart
And I feel the pain
This time I know it's for real


I don't know what to do
'Cause I can't seem to get through to you
What do I have to do
For you to believe me honey I said
This time I know it's for real


This time I know it's for real
Should I let you know how I feel
This time it's my heart that breaks apart
And I feel the pain
This time I know it's for real


This time I know it's for real
This time I know it's for real
As you requested here are the uncensored lyrics of "Smooth Criminal" by Michael Jackson:

As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down it was her doom

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay


If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me love me
Like you used to do


If I could turn back time
My world was shattered
I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife
And drove it deep in my heart


If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay


If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me love me
Like you used to do


If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay


I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes


If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me love me
Like you used to do


If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
The following are the uncensored lyrics of "Born to Be My Baby" by Bon Jovi:

Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away our love our lives
Close the door leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die our dreams our pride

My heart beats like a drum all night
Flesh to flesh one to one and it's alright
And I'll never let go 'cause

There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby I was made to be your man

Light a candle blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy baby that's okay our time our way

So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up baby it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life our world our flight

My heart beats like a drum all night
Flesh to flesh one to one and it's alright
And I'll never let go 'cause

There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby I was made to be your man

All night

So come on baby hold on tight
Oh we're headed for the mornin' light
We both know that we'll make it all right
'Cause I'll never let go

There's something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
And baby I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby I was made to be your man

You were born to be my baby
And baby I was made to be your man
You got me ringing' Hallelujah
Devil's screaming' a sinner's choosing
It's all about getting' hot and sweaty
Man on man lovein'
It's just the way that we're designed to be
Nothing more than little animals
Trying to get along
Dancing' in the sacrificial rhythm
Satan's agents all around you crying'
Armageddon it
Armageddon it
You got to give
A little bit more than you're getting'
You got to give
A little bit more than you're getting'
Don't stop now
I'm right on the edge
Hollywood eyes
Got you in a trap
Inject your soul
With electric light
Higher and higher
Tighter than tight
Armageddon it
Armageddon it
You got to give
A little bit more than you're getting'
You got to give
A little bit more than you're getting'
Don't stop now
Psychedelic ride
Futuristic vibe
The ultra-glide
The everlasting
Armageddon it
Armageddon it
You got to give
A little bit more than you're getting'
You got to give
A little bit more than you're getting'
Don't stop now
We'll gettin' hotter
Armageddon it
Armageddon it
You got to shake
Scream out your name
Put on this dress
I want to shake
I want to slide
Come on let's do it again
Let's do it again
Over and over again
Come on let's do it again
Let's do it again
In a million different ways
Let's start a fire
A cosmic flame
Let's take a ride
Across the sky
Surrender to the rhythm
Yeah surrender to the ride
Let's get together
And explode all right
Armageddon it
Armageddon it
Spent my nights with a roll of quarters
And I drank my beer alone
Every time I think of her
I always sing this song

Seems like I spent some time with the wrong woman
Only good for conversation
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her
Any girl in town who's married knows I ain't trying to upset her

Sorry for the things that I told her
And for the girls who said they were mine
Angel eyes please come back
To me and stay this time

Angel eyes please come back to me
And stay this time
Angel eyes don't you know that it tears me apart
I was always your own but I'm still lying here in the dark

I thought that I was in control
I was living too fast
Didn't know that I would hit a wall
And crash like broken glass

I played a game that I couldn't win
I wasted a lot of years
Now I'm talking to you but I don't know what to say
I'm afraid that the only words are tears

Angel eyes please come back to me
And stay this time
Angel eyes don't you know that it tears me apart
I was always your own but I'm still lying here in the dark

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Heaven" by Warrant:

Got a picture of your house
And you're standing by the door
It's black and white and faded
And it's looking pretty worn

See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray
But man they're really coming back

I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl

Chorus:
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way yeah

Now the lights are going out
Along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back
And it makes it pretty hard

I've got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never giving up on you

Chorus

I know somewhere somehow
I'll find a way
I've got to believe
It's only a matter of time

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Like a Prayer" by Madonna:


Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home


When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there


I hear your voice it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice I hear your voice
Feels like flying


I close my eyes oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky I close my eyes
Heaven help me


When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there


Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing it's like a dream
No end and no beginning


You're here with me it's like a prayer
Your voice can take me there


Just like a prayer I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me


Just like a prayer I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me


Since you've been gone

I feel my life slipping away

I look to the sky

And everything is turning gray

All I made was one mistake

How much more will I have to pay

Why can't you think it over

Why can't you forget about the past

Chorus:

When love makes this sound babe

A heart needs a second chance

Don't put me down babe

Can't you see I love you since

A heart needs a second chance



Loneliness

Is such a sad affair

I can hardly wait

To be with you again

What can I do

What can I say

To make you come back again





When love makes this sound babe

When love makes this sound babe

A heart needs a second chance




Verse 1:
Sometimes it's hard to make things clear
Or know when to face the truth
And I know that the moment is here
I'll open my heart and show you inside
My love has no pride
I feel with you I've got nothing to hide

Chorus:
So open your eyes and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself myself
Don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now or ever

Verse 2:
Baby I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me I'll be around
Forever
We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time
And I hope that's the way it will stay

Chorus

Bridge:
It's just the way that it is
And not what it seems
Love is a beautiful pain
But it's worth all the dreams

Chorus x2
