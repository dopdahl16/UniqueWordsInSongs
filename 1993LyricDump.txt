If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you ooh
Will always love you
You
My darling you
Mmm-mm

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So good-bye
Please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you you need

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You



I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I I will always love you
I will always love you
I I will always love you
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

For I can't help falling in love with you

Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes


Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes


Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain comes falling down
'Cause somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I found


Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes


And I I'm feeling like a little boy
Too little to take control
I I'm caught up in this dream like state
And your love's the key to my gate

Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes


Oh oh oh
That's the way love goes
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
That's the way love goes
Don't mind if I light candles
I like to watch us play and baby


Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes


And I I'm feeling like a little boy
Too little to take control
I I'm caught up in this dream like state
And your love's the key to my gate


Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes


And I I'm feeling like a little boy
Too little to take control
I I'm caught up in this dream like state
And your love's the key to my gate

Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
My love is blind can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes


Oh oh oh
That's the way love goes
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes

Verse 1:
I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I want to stay

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you oh-oh

Chorus:
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me by my side
I swallow my pride your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Verse 2:
Time after time after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around pride's fading
In my condition I don't want to be alone

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you oh-oh

I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing it's not a phase

It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Bridge:

No way can I deny it
Your love's so sweet it knocks me off my feet

Verse 3:
I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins

Boy it's something I can't explain
I get so weak
Something 'bout the way you do the things you do
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Chorus:
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me by my side

It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak

But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat

Don't front you know I got you open
That's why your ex-boyfriend's smoking like a chimney
The base is kicking and the treble's thumping
I'm alive so I'm gonna keep bumping
Cause where I'm from Marble Hill the street is fast
You hear a gunshot you hear a girl's ass
So all you fake tender brothers who try to front
You better have a good line to back up your stunt


Rump shaker rump shaker
All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom-zoom-zoom and a poom-poom
Just shake your rump


All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom-zoom-zoom and a poom-poom
Just shake your rump

I can certainly provide the uncensored lyrics of "A Whole New World" by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle: 


I can show you the world
Shining shimmering splendid
Tell me princess now when did
You last let your heart decide


I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride


A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "no"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming


A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you


Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring tumbling freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky


A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be


A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you


A whole new world
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me

Verse 1 Vanessa Williams:
Love is what we are made of
It's in the center of our souls
It's what we hear in every note
That makes us come together
Love is knowing each other's faults
And picking up right where we left off
It's a power that we can't explain
That brings us home again

Chorus:
Love is everything we do
It's what we breathe and what we hold on to
And every time I look at you
I know love is love is

Verse 2 Brian McKnight:
Love is the chance to be ourselves
To share our deepest secrets with no one else
It's the trust that we build over time
The lessons learned the mountains we climb
Love is the comfort of a touch
A tender kiss that says so much
It's stronger than we'll ever know
And it won't let us go

Chorus:
Love is everything we do
It's what we breathe and what we hold on to
And every time I look at you
I know love is love is

Bridge Vanessa Williams:
It's the laughter and the tears
It's the dreams that we share
Love is all of these things
And so much more

Chorus:
Love is everything we do
It's what we breathe and what we hold on to
And every time I look at you
I know love is love is
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep there's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never goin' back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything seems cut and dry
Day and night earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never goin' back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never goin' back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never comin' back
Runaway train tearin' up the track
Runaway train burnin' in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I'll Never Get Over You Getting Over Me" by Exposé:

There was a time when
Our love ran free
But now I'm paying
For mistakes made by me

I never listened
To your heart
Until I see you
Tearing apartah-ah

I'll never get over you
Getting over me
I'll never get over you
Getting over aaah

How can we be wrong
If what we had was strong
I'll never get over you 
Getting over me 

I never saw it
As a game
You were more
Than just a number
I refused to see
What I had in you
I was so blind 

Now I'm falling apart
Every time that I'm reminded
Of what I had
But now your'e gone
And I'm alone
With just a memory 

I'll never get over you
Getting over me
I'll never get over you
Getting over aaah

How can we be wrong
If what we had was strong
I'll never get over you 
Getting over me 

I'll never get over you
Getting over me
I'll never get over you
Getting over aaah

How can we be wrong
If what we had was strong
I'll never get over you 
Getting over me 

I'll never get over you
Getting over me
I'll never get over you
Getting over aaah

I'll never get over you
Getting over me
I'll never get over you 
Getting over aaah

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Ditty" by Paperboy:

Here I go here I go here I go again again
Girls what's my weakness Men
Ok then chillin' chillin' mindin' my business word
Yo Salt I looked around and I couldn't believe this
I swear I stared my niece my witness
The brother had it goin' on with somethin' kindauh
Wicked wicked oooo - had to kick it
I'm not shy so I asked for the digits
A ho No that don't make me
See what I want | slip slide to it swifty
Felt it in my hips | so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip | make me wanna do tricks for him
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell hell makes me wanna shoop shoop shoop
Shoop shoop ba-doop Shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop
You're packed and you're stacked | 'specially in the back
Brother wanna thank your mother for a butt like that thanks Mom
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake booty
If looks could kill you would be an uzi
You're a shotgun bang | What's up with that thang
I wanna know how does it hang
Straight up wait up hold up Mr Lover
Like Prince said "you're a sexy mutha-"
Well-a I like 'em real wild | b-boy style by the mile
Smooth black skin with a smile | bright as the sun
I wanna have some fun
Come and give me some of that yum-yum
Chocolate chip honey dip can I get a scoop
Baby take a ride in my coupe you make me wanna
Shoop shoop ba-doop Shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop
Funky with the feel-good factor | don't worry about a thing
Because the boogie-down Bronx has got it goin' on
And we're ready and willing with the freestyle lyrics
So now's the time for you to put your hands up | wave 'em in the air
And let's take it into overtime
Like a neighborhood bomber | I'm just too fly
That's the reason why all the guys | wanna know just who I am
Like a neighborhood bomber | I'm just too fly
That's the reason why all the girls | wanna know just who I am
You can't deny | we're fly | all the guys are behind us
So just let us | define ourselves | bust our moves | let's have some fun

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night
When I wake up well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
When I go out yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you

If I get drunk well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if I haver up yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you

But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

When I'm working yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
And when the money comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you

When I come home when I come home well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
And if I grow-old when I grow-old well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you

But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

When I'm lonely well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
And when I'm dreaming well I know I'm gonna dream
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you

When I go out when I go out well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
And when I come home when I come home yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you

But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door
One two princes kneel before you
That's what I said now
Princes princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
That's some bread now
This one said he wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head now
This one he got a princely racket
That's what I said now
Got some big seal upon his jacket
Ain't in his head now
Marry him your father will condone you
How 'bout that now
Marry me your father will disown you
He'll eat his hat now
Marry him or marry me
I'm the one that loves you baby can't you see
Ain't got no future or a family tree
But I know what a prince and lover ought to be
I know what a prince and lover ought to be
Said if you want to call me baby
Just go ahead now
And if you like to tell me maybe
Just go ahead now
And if you wanna buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now
Two princes kneel before you
That's what I said now
Princes princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
That's some bread now
This one said he wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head now
Two princes two princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
Two princes two princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
Two princes two princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
Two princes two princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Right Here Human Nature" / "Downtown" by SWV:


Sittin' here all alone
On a throne
I'm so cold
I'm so cold
Every breath I take
Blows the flames
Of hate and war
Inside my soul
And my heart's in desperate need
Of tender love and sweet caress
So won't you lay me down
And take me in your arms
And through the night
You'll keep me warm


I want you right here Ooh ooh
Right here next to me Ooh ooh
So I can hold you tight Ooh ooh
You're the one I need Ooh ooh


I'm so confused
About the things I feel
I'm tryna find
The words to say To say
I'm searching deep
Within my soul
For the answer
And it's gotta be right
For me to carry on
And through the night
I'll cling to you
And let you know
How much I need you baby


I want you right here Ooh ooh
Right here next to me Ooh ooh
So I can hold you tight Ooh ooh
You're the one I need Ooh ooh


Ooh I never knew love like this Like this before
Ooh ooh I never knew love
Ooh ooh never knew love like this Like this before
Ooh ooh never knew love


Looking out across the night time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Fill me
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs


I want you right here Ooh ooh
Right here next to me Ooh ooh
So I can hold you tight Ooh ooh
You're the one I need Ooh ooh


Down downtown Where everyone goes
Down downtown To feel the music and the heartbeat
Down downtown Where all the lights are bright
Down downtown To forget about life for a little while
Down downtown Let's go have some fun
Down downtown Watch the hustle and the bustle of the city
Down downtown We can wine and dine
Down downtown Let's dance the night away
Down downtown


I want you right here Ooh ooh
Right here next to me Ooh ooh
So I can hold you tight Ooh ooh
You're the one I need Ooh ooh
Share my life
Take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you

Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me no
I have nothing nothing nothing
If I don't have you you you
You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love
I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me no
I have nothing nothing nothing
If I don't have you you

If I don't have you oh
Oh oh oh oh
You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love mmm
I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore no no
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me don't walk away
Oh don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing nothing nothing
If I don't have you you
If I don't have you
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Mr Wendal" by Arrested Development:


Here have a dollar
In fact no brotherman here have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you

Be strong serve God only
Know that if you do beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes no money no plate

Mr Wendal that's his name
No one ever knew his name 'cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on an old bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one

Now that I know him to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused

Go ahead Mr Wendal 

Mr Wendal has freedom a free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness and an occasional harassment
By the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him but I just saw him eat off the food we waste

Civilization are we really civilized yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
Or killed over a racist grudge

Mr Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far 'cause on him we walk

Go ahead Mr Wendal 

 

Repeat 5x

I'll try my best to provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Ordinary World" by Duran Duran:

Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights the TV and the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all
Crazy some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find and as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me
Crazy some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find and as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Feared today forgot tomorrow
Here beside the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

And I don't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find and as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Every world is my world I will learn to survive
Any world is my world I will learn to survive
Any world is my world Every world is my world
Every world is my world Every world is my world

I hope this helps you
Verse 1:
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail
I'm gonna have some fun
What do you consider fun
Fun natural fun

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping

Chorus:
If I had no loot I'd get it
If I had no loot I'd get it
If I had no loot I'd get it
I'm living the life that I love and I'ma love the life that I live

Verse 2:
I'm making music and paying my bills
Gotta get up go out and get it
Get the skills and hey got to deal with
The money situation and feelin' oh so fine

In spite of the things you do
Extra lovin' cause for you
Is my love too much
Is too much too much for you to handle yeah

Chorus:
If I had no loot I'd get it
If I had no loot I'd get it
If I had no loot I'd get it
I'm living the life that I love and I'ma love the life that I live

Bridge:
My love's so sweet it's knocking me off my feet
Every time we meet I skip a beat

Outro:

And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact


But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
I won't do that


And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end


And some nights you're restless
And some nights you're so cold
And some nights you're just like an angel
Come and take me back home


And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you


As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it that I would do
Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that


Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God of Sex and Drums and Rock 'n' Roll
And then I pray to Jesus
And I pray to Buddha too
And I realize no prayer has been sent
So oh the hell with you
Listen fuckheads

We'll never be stopped what

We'll never be stopped come on

We'll never be stopped what

We'll never be stopped slam

Somebody once told me that I could make some money 

By rhyming words and being a dummy 

I guess in retrospect I couldn't agree 

Some minimum wage job is the life for me 

But then I heard it from a friend of a friend 

That Onyx got paid for makin' violent ends 

This is true I wish I trampled you 

Put your head in the dirt and walk away with my shoe 

Cause I'm not the one for the petty yeah 

I got beef with radio if they don't wanna play me 

One tough industry that's what they'll say 

I'm fuckin' livid at that we'll blitz like the blitzkrieg 

We've got the crowd Hype like a SWAT team 

We're here to make a point so don't try to ignore us 

It's natural but personally I am much worse 

And this goes out to big business 

Which tried to dis this our style is much too vicious 

Even with the hype we couldn't be larger 

We'll always be Onyx don't ever fuck with the squad 

We'll never be stopped what

We'll never be stopped come on

We'll never be stopped what

We'll never be stopped slam

And if we're ever caught

With our britches down and we're gettin' beat

We'll be sure to go out with a bang

And a middle finger up in the air screaming

"WEST SIDE"

"We'll never be stopped"
Verse 1:
Slowly but surely I walk through the door
With body and soul and mind in awe
I looked and I saw a world that was strange
Like nothing before only myself to blame
So I go on and hope and pray
That I'll find my way back to yesterday
But looking through patient eyes
We see the signs and realise
We'll have the time of our lives
We'll dance until the morning sun
And in our hearts we'll share as one

Chorus:
But looking through patient eyes
We see the signs and realise
We'll have the time of our lives
We'll dance until the morning sun
And in our hearts we'll share as one

Verse 2:
So I'm living my life and I won't worry
I'll dance with destiny and I'll take glory
I fight every day forging ahead
Through the lows and highs 'til I reach the end
For life is mine and it's what I make it
So I'll follow my dreams and I won't fake it
But looking through patient eyes
We see the signs and realise
We'll have the time of our lives
We'll dance until the morning sun
And in our hearts we'll share as one

But looking through patient eyes
We see the signs and realise

I've been waiting for you
Signed with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you
Can't ever keep from falling apart
At the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart
To pieces

Oh it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now
We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry

Who do you need Who do you love
When you come undone
Who do you need Who do you love
When you come undone

Words playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chill is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers

Can't ever keep from falling apart
At the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart
To pieces

Lost in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now
We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside

Hey child stay wilder than the wind
And blow me in to cry

Who do you need Who do you love
When you come undone
Who do you need Who do you love
When you come undone

repeat and fade
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Don't Wanna Fight" by Tina Turner:


There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon


It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere and we both know why
But me I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending I can't live this life


I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking babe
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more


But baby let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I'd Die Without You" by PM Dawn:

Is it my turn to wish you were lying here
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world
Or even imagine your emotions to tell myself anything
Is it my turn to hold your hands
Tell you I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing

If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice
Oh whatever baby whatever baby
If I have to take apart
All that I am
Is there anything that I would not do
'Cause inside I'd die without you

Oh I apologize for all the things I've done and said
I'm not ashamed to tell you I'm so glad we're through
But if you ever find yourself
All alone and crying
You'd come back to me

But I'm gone yeah yeah yeah

If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice
Oh whatever baby whatever baby
If I have to take apart
All that I am
Is there anything that I would not do
'Cause inside I'd die without you

If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice
Oh whatever baby whatever baby
If I have to take apart
All that I am
Is there anything that I would not do
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

I'm about to throw down
The mic that you're using
Circular motion if you twistin' like a hurricane
Listen to the sound I'm making

Supa dupa
Loopa
Here comes the troopa
So start the game
Shoot ya
Hoops ya
Floatin' like a butterfly comin' down like a pile driver
Why is it everytime I try to do something nice for you
You look at me like it's some kind of disease
But still I'm doin' what I do

So don't front to me like you're some kind of angel
Or it's me against you
Or you against me
Let's get together and make some sensation

Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Verse 1:
You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day Hey
I'm rockin' and you're yawning
But you never look my way Hey

Chorus x2:
Hip Hop Hooray Ho Hey Ho
Verse 2:
You bad-mouthed my game screamed my name
And hung my style

And the price got higher
And I ain't no liar Hey
Indigenous people shout
Hip Hop Hooray Ho Hey Ho

Chorus x2:
Hip Hop Hooray Ho Hey Ho

Verse 3:
You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day Hey
I'm rockin' and you're yawning
But you never look my way Hey
I'm licking down you darlin'
In every single way Hey
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way

Chorus x2:
Hip Hop Hooray Ho Hey Ho
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Another Sad Love Song" by Toni Braxton:

Since you been gone
I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there you are baby once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' bout you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again
It's just another lonely love song
Playing on my radio
And it's all because of you
Just keeps reminding me
I'm so lonely baby
One broken hearted love song
I'm outta love missed you so much
I'm so lonely even 
On the radio
The love songs that we used to hear
Are coming in so clear
I keep listening to the radio
But this hurt that I can't handle
For the chance of a romance
Where did we go wrong
But it's all because of you
It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
It's just another sad love song
Playing on my radio
And it's all because of you
Just keeps reminding me
I'm so alone
I'm so sorry baby
So sorry baby
Sorry baby
Sorry baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Uh-huh huh huh
Hold me
Like the river Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there

Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong will you mold me
When lost will you find me
But they told me a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

Hold me
Lay your head lowly
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed carry

Singin'
Hold me
Ooh lay your head lowly
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me
Love me and feed me
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed carry

Hold me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Show me you care
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed carry

Say woo
Lonesome times
And they're fleeting by
Not enough
Hours in one day

More than enough
To do my wrongs
I'll be a part of
Yesterday

Tell me
Hey
Will you be there
Tell me
Ooh
Will you be there
Help me
Uh-huh
Hold me
Uh-huh
Love me and feed me
Uh-huh
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed carry
Hold me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Show me you care
Ooh woo
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed carry
Longer
You will be there
Ooh
Will you be there
Yeah
Ease my lonely
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed carry
Hold me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Show me you care
Need me
Love me and feed me
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed carry

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Good Enough" by Bobby Brown:


I've been around the world and back again
Listen let me tell you
What I learned from all my travels


Yeah I like to smoke and I like to drink
I like to have sex and I like to think
It turns me on when I see a lady cry
Don't need no one to tell me why


I'm good enough the way I am
I said I'm good enough just the way I am
Don't  need nobody else don't need no one else
Just the way I am
I'm good enough the way I am
Just the way I am


My heart is big and my blood runs wild
I'm an animal but I'm well-behaved child
I don't take no mess from nobody else
I don't give no job to nobody else


I'm good enough the way I am
I said I'm good enough just the way I am
Don't need nobody else don't need no one else
Just the way I am
I'm good enough the way I am
Just the way I am


Listen I'm gonna say it one more time
I'm good enough the way I am
I said I'm good enough just the way I am
Don't need nobody else don't need no one else
Just the way I am
I'm good enough the way I am
Just the way I am
25 years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on

And I say hey hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
And I say hey hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on

Ooh ooh oooohh
Ooh ooh oooohh

And I try oh my god do I try
I try all the time in this institution
And I pray oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day for a revolution
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on

And I say hey hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
And I say hey hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on

And I say hey hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
And I say hey hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on

Ooh ooh oooohh
Ooh ooh oooohh

25 years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
Verse 1:
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life
When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
Oh what a morning
It's not a day for work

Just laying on the beach and having fun

She's going to get you
All that she wants is another baby

Verse 1:
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savior-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through
All space and time so don't cry

Chorus:
One day all seven will die
And I'll be yours until the end of time

Come 2 me don't be afraid
Of things your mind conceives

And tonight we can truly say
Together we're invincible

All things are possible
In the end all seven will die

Chorus:
And I'll be yours until the end of time

Verse One:
It's N****s like you that makes me a little bit ohhh
N****s like you that gotta go back to the lab
And come back with some s*** like that
And not a g****** thing to do with Dre Day
I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop
Until I get the n***** get a glock and pop it
Drop-drop and if I hit the switch
I can make the a** drop

Chorus:
"Today was a good day"

Verse Two:
Met this b**** named Tammy hoes everywhere
Checkin' out my fella but it ain't nothin' there
Move along change up for the n**** I'm all about
Increasing finances steady flowin'
But don't get it twisted I'm still Double-O
And a n**** with a grip like mine
Can't be slippin' bang bang
Took me off the scene for a minute
Now I'm back for good and you know I'm with it
You know where I'm comin' from 
Yeah you know where I'm comin' from

Chorus:
"Today was a good day"

Verse Three:
Hey you punk with the fella's in the tank
While you're yankin' on my D***
Pullin' on my dank but you got to come up with something more than that
An OG used to say that I hope you're lovin' my new sayings
Like little geek tryin' to be a G but couldn't flip fast enough
Fella's on his knees in the parkin' lot but you ain't even hit a corner
MAC-10 to your dome pow now you're a gonner
You wanna take a trip to the Compton zoo
But you're scared of the lions and tigers too
I guess you got the flow from your daddy
Cuz you're swingin' like a little g-witty fella

Chorus:
"Today was a good day"

Verse Four:
Well it's the INE INE INEK comin' to the AA
Yet to freak off gettin' more a** than a booby
The silly n**** Danny boy you look silly
Silly as f*** "boy you know you're silly"
What's that look on your face
Gee golly wiz mister that's just how I look
When I'm really good and I'm really really wired
Try to understand why I do this
Yo Mr Fella
I ain't the one
No I ain't the one
I feel sorry for your mother
B**** ohhh ohh
Surprise mothaf**ker
Ahh Got the drop on the cop
Ice Cube will break his neck
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta

Chorus:
"Today was a good day"
My shattered dreams and broken heart
Are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands
Standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone
Wishing all my feelings were gone
I gave my best to you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry


One last cry before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you outta my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to my last cry

I was here you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to reign on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feelings were gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry


One last cry before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you outta my mind for the very last time
Stop living a lie I know I've gotta be strong
Cause round me life goes on and on and on and on

I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I have my


One last cry before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you outta my mind this time
Stop living a lie I know I've gotta be strong
Cause round me life goes on and on and on and on


And on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Verse 1:
Every man wants a woman
Where him and her can just go hang
Just the two of them alone kick back
Doing their own thing
And every man wants a woman
That can always keep him in the mood
And I'm that kind of girl
So this is what I tell my dude

Chorus:
I say "Daddy I want you"
"Just you nobody else"
"I want you all to myself"
"Give it to me like I want it"
"I'm not playing games"
"Every word that I'm saying is coming straight from the heart"

Verse 2:
I'm not the kind of girl
That can share my secrets and my love
Cause it's a long and endless road
When you're trying to please two loves
And I'm giving you my heart and my soul
And all of my desires
And every night when you lay alone
This is what I wanna hear

Chorus:
I say "Daddy I want you"
"Just you nobody else"
"I want you all to myself"
"Give it to me like I want it"
"I'm not playing games"
"Every word that I'm saying is coming straight from the heart"

Bridge:
Cause every man
Needs a woman to himself
To make him feel
Like he don't need nobody else
So I'm yours
And you're mine
That's the way
It'll be until the end of time

Chorus:
I say "Daddy I want you"
"Just you nobody else"
"I want you all to myself"
"Give it to me like I want it"
"I'm not playing games"
"Every word that I'm saying is coming straight from the heart"
Round and round round we go
Haha yeah 
I get around
Still clown with the Underground when we come around
Stronger than ever
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don’t know why your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me she squeeze me lady take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy but tease me
I don’t want it if it’s that easy
 Easy
Ay ugh
Animal patterns on my satin durag
Diagonal parked in a red zone with my rags on
Get my drink on and my smoke on
Then go home with somethin’ to poke on
Yeah loc’ 
‘Cause locs get sprayed locs get laid
Bitches on my top uh 
Never hesitate to put a bullet in a bitch nigga’s head
Is she really going out with him 
Ey doowutchalike
Adina Howard got you steamin’ like a hot kettle
Mississippi and the pussy was a bomb
Met her at the Mystic on some good shit
Lookin’ like a striptease anything but typical
She give me LaFace and I’m never gonna trip
Yeah 
Just like Collard Greens
Yeah yeah yeah

You know me
Who’s down with OPP
Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up
And French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head while
We're talking about all of the things
That I longed to believe
About love the truth what you mean
To me and the truth is baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night
To see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died

Oh yeah

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down oh

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

We are lovers true and through and though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration be the real love that I need


Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searching for a real love


I got to have a real love
Loves so true and oh baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer to the questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong if I stay strong maybe
I'll find my real love


Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free real love
I'm searching for a real love


I thought I loved you but I really didn't know
That love was just a game
You played me like a fool and now I finally see
The light shining on me
I need a love that's true gonna give me all that's mine
Someone to care for me through the good times and the bad times
We'll be together for always
That's what real love is all about


Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free real love
I'm searching for a real love


Real love oh I'm searching for a real love
Oh baby real love

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking 'fore I knew it and as he grew
He'd say "I'm gonna be like you Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
"When you comin' home Dad" "I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"

My son turned ten just the other day
He said "Thanks for the ball Dad come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw" I said "Not today
I got a lot to do" he said "That's okay"
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said "I'm gonna be like him yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home Dad" "I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"

Well he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
"Son I'm proud of you can you sit for a while"
He shook his head and said with a smile
"What I'd really like Dad is to borrow the car keys
See you later can I have them please"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home Son" "I don't know when
But we'll get together then Dad
You know we'll have a good time then"

I've long since retired and my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
He said "I'd love to Dad if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you"

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
"When you comin' home Son" "I don't know when
But we'll get together then Dad
You know we'll have a good time then"

Sure below are the uncensored lyrics of "Deeper and Deeper" by Madonna:


Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter


I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know


When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me


Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter


Tonight's the night I'm feeling like
Like I want to lose control
Come on baby let's get closer
Come on baby let's get closer


When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me


Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter


When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me


Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter


Come on darling let's get closer
Come on darling let's get closer
I wanna be yours I wanna be yours
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Rain" by Madonna:

I feel it it's coming  
Rain  
Feel it on my finger tips  
Hear it on my window pane  
Your love's coming down like  
Rain  

Wash away my sorrow take away my pain  
Your love's coming down like  
Rain  

When your lips are burning mine  
And you take the time to tell me how you feel  
When you listen to my words  
And I know you've heard I know it's real  

Rain is what this thunder brings  
For the first time I can hear my heart sing  
Call me a fool but I know I'm not  
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top  
Till I feel your  


  
Rain  
I hear it I feel it  
Rain  
Wash away my sorrow take away my pain  
Your love's coming down like rain  

Rain  
I hear it I feel it  
Rain  
I'm gonna take that long walk  
Through the desert I'm gonna do it  
Cause I need to feel your  
Rain  
I'm gonna take that long walk  
Through the desert I'm gonna do it  
Cause I need to feel your  
Rain  

I'm gonna take that long walk  
Through the desert I'm gonna do it  
Cause I need to feel your  
Rain  
I'm gonna take that long walk  
Through the desert I'm gonna do it  
Cause I need to feel your  
Rain  

Rain  
I hear it I feel it  
Rain  
Wash away my sorrow take away my pain  
Your love's coming down like rain  

Rain

Verse 1:
It's the middle of the night and I'm still awake
Thoughts of you are heavy and they just won't break
I know I've been mistaken but girl what can I do
I admit it I'm addicted I'm a fool for you

Chorus:
Do you believe in us
Can we still be in love
Do you believe in us
Can we find a way to make it right

Verse 2:
I know I've been a liar I know I've been untrue
But oh my love I swear I'll make it up to you
I'm just a man I'm not perfect but I'll try
Without you here beside me I'll surely die

Chorus:
Do you believe in us
Can we still be in love
Do you believe in us
Can we find a way to make it right

Love that you search for
Will suddenly bring
Fly to the sky
On wings of your heart
Feel beyond reason

Out of the ashes the phoenix will rise
Phoenix of love that never dies
Hold onto hope and soon you'll see
The beauty of life where you're meant to be

Boom shake shake shake the room
Boom shake shake shake the room
Boom shake shake shake the room
Tick tick tick tick boom

Uh guess who's back with a brand new beat
It's the same OG but I been low-key
Hated on by most these n***** with no cheese
No deals and no G's no wheels and no keys
No boats no snowmobiles and no ski's
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze
Ho please
Head honcho need a Swahili term for king
I'm waiting for my sneakers bruh
Jump jump
Boom shake shake shake the room
Tick tick tick tick boom
Verse 1:
The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true
When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

Chorus:
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide all the fear she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

Verse 2:
She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen down
No matter what's been going on
She's always been around
And when the world outside my arms
Is bitter cold and gray
She knows just what to say
To chase the pain away

Chorus:
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide all the fear she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

Bridge:
So let me be the one that never leaves
And let me be the one that always believes
The things that she says

Chorus:
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide all the fear she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries 

Outro:
When she cries at night

Breakfast with no hog
Nonstoppin' when I'm in the car
I got a beep from Kim

And she can f*ck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
"Which park are y'all playin' basketball"

Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week f*cked around and got a triple double
Freakin' n*ggas everyway like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
Verse 1:
Come on baby won't you tell me what's the word
Waiting for your loving baby nothing can't be heard
Runnin' for love an peace it's what I'm dreaming of
And when I think of you my heart starts to rush above

Chorus:
More and more I don't know where we're going to
More and more I wanna be with you

More and more I wanna be with you

Together forever come on let's play

We're starting now and we're going strong my dear

Chorus:

More and more I wanna be with you

Outro:
More and more more and more
Verse 1: 

We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Them they got moved by these hard rock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents deep fatter joints called undergrounds
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flocked to booms man boogie had to change


Chorus:

Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's a funky fly soul like Attract-Ion
Can I get a hit hit
Boom bip with a brother named slick like Rick James
When I'm out street walking on sunset
When my antennas missed a note
And now I'm hearing echo location
Via every living inch of space aka aiya-bo-ya
Most kids are deaf blind to the fact
That's stated in the first lesson
VERSE 2:

I'm funky not a junkie but I know where to get it
No need to OD just listen to me and you will see
That we're flowin' smooth enough like a cause and effect
And we're the brothers with the fat mad flava to correct it
It's the groove 'cause Smooth is always in the pocket
Of course when I'm taking a stroll through the cornfields
Or through the tunnel just to see who can hear me
I'm pushin' fat walls of Ivan Rebroff
It's the Looney Tune flip trip skip with the funky hi-hat
Bump the freaks and feed 'em this rap
What more can happen What Nothing
Slick is in the mix and the mix is in me
No need to convince or be born again
That's already in just like a sin like the ending
Prime is for the rhymes swine are for the ears
That's why I'm ag'in'


Chorus:

Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's a funky fly soul like Attract-Ion
Can I get a hit hit
Boom bip with a brother named slick like Rick James
When I'm out street walking on sunset
When my antennas missed a note
And now I'm hearing echo location
Via every living inch of space aka aiya-bo-ya
Most kids are deaf blind to the fact
That's stated in the first lesson

A certain kind of light
That never shone on me

To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring

I live and breathe for you but
What good does it do
If I ain't got you ain't got you

There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in fields of gold

So she took her love for to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold

We'll walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
As you lie in fields of gold

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold

When we walked in fields of gold

When we walked in fields of gold

If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe  

Someone like you makes it hard to live without  
Somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give  
Never thinkin' of myself  

If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way just a way to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe

In my dream we were drowning sorrows deep and my love legless she's dragging me down down again and the pain the last time that it came was gone with the reason denied in your own life

You'll break it down again so tell me how to do it

Lessons learned we forget every little tug every little nudge all falls down Auto mantra universal truth you'll be rich you'll be famous and I'll be so proud of you

I'll break it down again so tell me how to do it

Oh these friends they'll scheme and scheme while we're all waiting for the ground to fall I know it's hard believing the words you keep repeating that I must follow you wherever you may go

If this all amounts to nothing in the end then nothing's enough I'll break it down again so tell me how to do it

Your heart may be broken in two girl
But I'm the one to mend the pieces make it right
Believe me you need someone who can love you sweet

Baby just wait and see

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Three Little Pigs" by Green Jellÿ:

Once upon a time
In a land far away
Three little pigs
Would rue the day

The wolf came around
With a huff and puff
Blowin' their house down
'Cause they weren't tough enough

Chorus
But the pigs had a plan
They had a scheme
To cook the wolf when
He came in their dream

Well the first little piggy
Well he was kinda hick
He spent most of his days
Just a-scratchin' on his d*ck

He built a little house
But it wasn't very strong
When the wolf came by
It didn't take very long

Chorus
But the pigs had a plan
They had a scheme
To cook the wolf when
He came in their dream

Well the second little piggy
Built a house of sticks
He was somewhat smarter
But still a little hick

When the wolf came around
And started to blow
Little piggy laughed
'Cause he already knows

Chorus
But the pigs had a plan
They had a scheme
To cook the wolf when
He came in their dream

Well the third little piggy
Built a house of bricks
He knew the wolf would come
And try to blow his house to bits

So he went off to school
And he learned a few tricks
He built a house not of sticks
But a house made of bricks

Chorus
But the pigs had a plan
They had a scheme
To cook the wolf when
He came in their dream

Now the wolf came back
And he huffed and he puffed
But he couldn't blow down
The brick house tough

So he climbed on the roof
To get the little pigs
But he found that pot of boiling water
And he died in agony

Chorus
But the pigs had a plan
They had a scheme
To cook the wolf when
He came in their dream
There have been different versions of the lyrics of "Livin' on the Edge" by Aerosmith but here is one uncensored version:


There's somethin' wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes


We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise


We're livin' on the edge
We're living on the edge
We're living on the edge


We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise


We're just a talkin' 'bout the future
Forgot about the past
It's not where I want to be


We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise


Tell me what you think about your situation
Complication aggravation is getting to you
If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin'
Even if it wasn't would you still come crawlin'
Back again
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again and again
Found a girl and you’re married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn’t give to you

Old friend why are you so shy
Ain’t like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away I couldn’t fight it
I had hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
That for me it isn’t over

Never mind I’ll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don’t forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes they’re memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste

Never mind I’ll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don’t forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I’ll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don’t forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You could say I lost my sense of direction
You could say all of this and worse but
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
They all seemed like game show hosts to me
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face
I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first:
If I ever lose my faith in you
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

that it only takes a minute of your precious time
to turn around and I'll be two steps behind

I'll be two steps behind you
Wherever you go and I'll be there

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Again" by Janet Jackson:

I heard from a friend today  
And she said you were in town  
Suddenly the memories came back to me  
In my mind  
How can I be strong I've asked myself  
Time and time I've said  
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave  
My soul you took away  
Good intentions you had many  
I know you did  
I come from a place that hurts  
And God knows how I've cried  
And I never want to return  
Never fall again  
Making love to you  
Oh it felt so good and  
Oh so right  
How can I be strong I've asked myself  
Time and time I've said  
That I'll never fall in love with you  
Again  
So here we are alone again  
Didn't think it'd come to this  
And to know it all began  
With just a little kiss  
I've come too close to happiness  
To have it swept away  
Don't think I can take the pain  
No never fall again  
Kinda late in the game and  
My heart is in your hands  
Don't you stand there and then  
Tell me you love  
Me then leave again  
Cause I'm falling in love with  
You again  
Hold me  
Hold me  
Don't ever let me go  
Say it just one time  
Say you love me  
God knows I do  
Love you  
Again
Verse 1:
I hear her voice in my mind like footsteps down the hall
What could I say I was late she was gone
I remember what she said and then she turned away
But now I'm talking to the walls instead of talking to her

Chorus:
How do you talk to an angel
How do you hold her close to where you are
How do you talk to an angel
It's like trying to catch a falling star

Verse 2:
At night I dream and she feels so close
But when I wake up I just don't know
How to face another day without her in my life
I don't know how to live without her I need her by my side

Chorus

Bridge:
I don't know how you can be so far
But like a distant star I'm wishing on you tonight
Wishing on you tonight

Chorus x2
