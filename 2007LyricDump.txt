To the left to the left
To the left to the left
To the left to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bag let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact he'll be here in a minute baby
You must not know 'bout me you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up on that chick and see if she is home
Oops I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for
'Cause you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact he'll be here in a minute baby
You must not know 'bout me you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
To the left to the left
To the left to the left
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it

Uh huh uh huh Yeah Rihanna
Uh huh uh huh Good girl gone bad

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain I hydroplane in the Bank
Comin' down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone we Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better
You know me: in anticipation
For precipitation Stacked chips for the rainy day
Jay rain man is back with little Ms Sunshine
Rihanna where you at


You have my heart and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because when the sun shines we'll shine together
Told you I'd be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh


No clouds in my storms
Let it rain I hydroplane in the Bank

When the clouds come we gone we Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better
You know me: in anticipation
For precipitation Stacked chips for the rainy day
Jay rain man is back with little Ms Sunshine
Rihanna where you at


This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live baby
We're luxurious like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love we're rollin' in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear baby
Diamond in the rough is lookin' so sparkly
We're under pressure seven billion people in the world
Tryin' to fit in keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frownin'
But hey now you're a rockstar baby
You've got it come on Vibe with me dah dah dah dah dah dah
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
Verse 1 - Gwen Stefani
If I could escape I would but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

Chorus - Gwen Stefani
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever
Perfectly together
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Verse 2 - Akon
If I could be sweet sorry boy
I know I've been a real bad girl I didn't mean for you to get hurt
I didn't mean for you to get hurt so ever
We can make it better
Tell me boy wouldn't that be sweet
Chorus - Gwen Stefani
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever
Perfectly together
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Verse 3 - Akon
I wanna get away baby tonight

You know we can make it alright
We could make it better than it ever was I'll be waiting
I wanna get away get away get away get away
Chorus - Gwen Stefani
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever
Perfectly together
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could escape

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center clarity
Peace serenity


I hope you know I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry don't cry
Don't cry don't cry

The path that I'm walking I must go alone
I must take the baby steps till I'm full grown full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay
I hope you know I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late dark outside
I need to be with myself and center clarity
Peace serenity


And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

Right now uncensored lyrics of "Before He Cheats" by Carrie Underwood are:

Right now he's probably
Slow dancing with a bleach blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying
Her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whisky
Right now he's probably up behind her
With a pool stick showing her
How to shoot a combo
And he don't know
That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she's probably saying "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh you know it won't be on me
No not on me
'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh before he cheats
Hey there Delilah /
What's it like in New York City /
I'm a thousand miles away /
But girl tonight you look so pretty /
Yes you do /
Times Square can't shine as bright as you /
I swear it's true /

Hey there Delilah /
Don't you worry about the distance /
I'm right there if you get lonely /
Give this song another listen /
Close your eyes /
Listen to my voice it's my disguise /
I'm by your side /

Oh it's what you do to me /
Oh it's what you do to me /
Oh it's what you do to me /
Oh it's what you do to me /
What you do to me /

Hey there Delilah /
I know times are getting hard /
But just believe me girl /
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar /
We'll have it good /
We'll have the life we knew we would /
My word is good /

Hey there Delilah /
I've got so much left to say /
If every simple song I wrote to you /
Would take your breath away /
I'd write it all /
Even more in love with me you'd fall /
We'd have it all /

Oh it's what you do to me /
Oh it's what you do to me /
Oh it's what you do to me /
Oh it's what you do to me /

A thousand miles seems pretty far /
But they've got planes and trains and cars /
I'd walk to you if I had no other way /
Our friends would all make fun of us /
And we'll just laugh along because /
We know that none of them have felt this way /

Delilah I can promise you /
That by the time we get through /
The world will never ever be the same /
And you're to blame /

Hey there Delilah /
You be good and don't you miss me /
Two more years and you'll be done with school /
And I'll be making history /
Like I do /
You'll know it's all because of you /
We can do whatever we want to /

Hey there Delilah here's to you /
This one's for you /
In the day  
In the night  
Say it right  
Say it all  
You either got it  
Or you don't  
You either stand or you fall  
When your will is broken  
When it slips from your hand  
When there's no time for joking  
There's a hole in the plan  
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me  
No you don't mean nothing at all to me  
But you've got what it takes to set me free  
Oh you could mean everything to me  
I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault  
I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark  
I can't say that I don't know that I am alive  
And all of what I feel I could show  
You tonight you tonight  
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me  
No you don't mean nothing at all to me  
But you've got what it takes to set me free  
Oh you could mean everything to me  
From my hands I could give you  
Something that I made  
From my mouth I could sing you another brick that I laid  
From my body I could show you a place God knows  
You should know the space is holy  
Do you really want to go
Yes here are the uncensored lyrics of "Glamorous" by Fergie featuring Ludacris:

Verse 1:
If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home
You say: "If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home"
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S yeah G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

Verse 2:
We flying the first class up in the sky
Poppin' champagne living my life
In the fast lane and I won't change
By the glamorous ooh the flossy flossy

Chorus:
The glamorous the glamorous glamorous the glamorous
By the glamorous oh the flossy flossy

Verse 3:
Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens
Magazines and boogie scenes
I'm not clean I'm not pristine
I'm no queen I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through raw as hell
I don't care I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin' reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm in
repeat chorus

Verse 4: Ludacris
I'm talkin' champagne wishes caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Brother gotta keep enough lettuce
To support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous
Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Takin' trips from here to Rome
So If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S yeah G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S
repeat chorus
Tell me tell me baby  
Why can't you leave me  
Cause even though I shouldn't want it  
It makes me wonder  
Doesn't it  
Tell me tell me baby  
Why don't you need me  
When I make me feel so good  
It makes me Wonder  
Where is your heart  
I don't really want to know  
But I've got to tell you so  
Cause it's hurting me  
More than I can show  
If I'm not makin' sense  
Please forgive me my defense  
Is my offense  
Yeah  
Tell me baby  
Why can't you distance yourself  
When I'm hurting more than you are  
It's like you put a spell on me I can't get far  
You're the one I want and it's embarassing  
I'm head over heels with no balance  
I'm sure this isn't love or lust or anyone else  
Cause when it feels this good nobody else can ever tell  
Tell me tell me baby  
Why can't you leave me  
Cause even though I shouldn't want it  
It makes me wonder  
If you're the one for me  
I'm wrong why aren't you scared of me  
Why do you care for me  
When we all fall down  
Like toy soldiers  
Without a sound  
We're falling apart  
Like again like it was the first time  
I never wanna let you down  
I don't wanna hold you down  
I don't wanna make you come around  
But I'm the one you found
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I was blown away  
What could I say  
It all seemed to make sense  
You've taken away everything  
And I can't deal with that  
I try to see the good in life  
But good things in life are hard to find  
We'll blow it away blow it away  
Can we make this something good  
Well I'll try to do it right this time around  
Let's start over I'll try to do it right this time around  
It's not over  
Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground  
This love is killing me  
But you're the only one  
It's not over  
Taken all I could take  
And I cannot wait  
We're wasting too much time  
Being strong holding on  
Can't let it bring us down  
My life with you means everything  
So I won't give up that easily  
I'll blow it away blow it away  
Can we make this something good  
Well I'll try to do it right this time around  
Let's start over I'll try to do it right this time around  
It's not over

This love is killing me  
But you're the only one

Look how far we've come my baby  
We might have took the long way  
We knew we'd get there someday  
It's not over

This love is killing me  
But you're the only one  
It's not over

They want my treasure so they get their pleasures from my photo

Boys just come and go like seasons

Fergalicious so delicious

And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious

What Goes Around Comes Around by Justin Timberlake: 

Hey girl is he everything you wanted in a man  
You know I gave you the world  
You had me in the palm of your hand  
So why your love went away  
I just can't seem to understand  
Thought it was me and you babe  
Me and you until the end  
But I guess I was wrong  

Don't wanna think about it  
Don't wanna talk about it  
I'm just so sick about it  
Can't believe it's ending this way  

Just so confused about it  
Feeling the blues about it  
I just can't do without ya  
Tell me is this fair  

Is this the way it's really going down  
Is this how we say goodbye  
Should've known better when you came around  
That you were gonna make me cry  
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around  
'Cause I know that you're living a lie  
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find   

What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  

Now girl I remember everything that you claimed  
You said that you were moving on now  
And maybe I should do the same  
Funny thing about that is  
I was ready to give you my name  
Thought it was me and you babe  
And now it's all just a shame  
And I guess I was wrong  

Don't wanna think about it  
Don't wanna talk about it  
I'm just so sick about it  
Can't believe it's ending this way  

Just so confused about it  
Feeling the blues about it  
I just can't do without ya  
Can you tell me is this fair  

Is this the way it's really going down  
Is this how we say goodbye  
Should've known better when you came around  
That you were gonna make me cry  
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around  
'Cause I know that you're living a lie  
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find  

What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  

I thought I told ya  
Hey boy I warned ya  
Oh heaven knows  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around    

What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around  

I thought I told ya  
Hey boy I warned ya  
Oh heaven knows  
What goes around goes around goes around  
Comes all the way back around

I got a funny feeling
The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinking lots of crazy things
I even think that I maybe kinda like you
I even think that I maybe kinda like you


Oh whoa whoa
And all I keep thinking about is her
In my arms and I won't feel better
And all I keep thinking about is her
She she said she'd be mine forever
Whoa whoa


Got a funny thing for the girl
She's got a funny thing for the clouds
I kinda like her
She's everything I've ever wanted in a girl
I've been pretty girls and ugly girls
Creepy girls and nerdy girls
But the only one for me is you
And I will never ever ever be untrue


Oh whoa whoa
And all I keep thinking about is her
In my arms and I won't feel better
And all I keep thinking about is her
She she said she'd be mine forever
Whoa whoa


I'm twenty miles away
And I'll be back again
To kiss you on your salty lips
And grab your by your hips
I'm leaving you this note
You look beautiful tonight
And when I'm gone I'll miss you
Come and kiss me one last time


Oh whoa whoa
And all I keep thinking about is her
In my arms and I won't feel better
And all I keep thinking about is her
She she said she'd be mine forever
Whoa whoa
Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

Let him know that you know best 
Cause after all you do know best 
Try to slip past his defense 
Without granting innocence 

Lay down a list of what is wrong 
The things you've told him all along 
And pray to God he hears you 
And I pray to God he hears you 

Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

As he begins to raise his voice 
You lower yours and grant him one last choice 
Drive until you lose the road 
Or break with the ones you've followed 

He will do one of two things 
He will admit to everything 
Or he'll say he's just not the same 
And you'll begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

How to save a life 
How to save a life 

Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night 
Had I known how to save a life
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Home" by Daughtry:

I'm staring out into the night
Trying to hide the pain
I'm going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain

Well I'm going home
Back to the place where I belong
I'm not running from
No I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home

Well I'm going home

The miles are getting longer it seems
The closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true
And I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try

So I'm going home
Back to the place where I belong
I'm not running from
No I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you might just get it all
You just might get it all
And then some you don't want

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you might just get it all
You just might get it all yeah

Oh well I'm going home
Back to the place where I belong
I'm not running from
No I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

I said these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home
I'm going home

Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love my love

And I can tell by the way you lookin' at me my love my love
And now it's time for me to take my place
Back in your life back in your bed back in your heart and back in your head

I'm back and I'm better I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up I wanna give you better
Baby it's whatever somebody gotta step up

JR Sean Kingston
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal suicidal
When you say it's over

Verse 2:
See it started at the park
Used to chill at the dark
Oh when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought
That love lasts forever lasts forever
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together last together

Watchin' movies all the time
Oh when I went away
For doin' my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other see each other
And then I came out
Mami moved me down South
Oh I'm with my girl
Who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me girl for me

Greg Street approve this message
And we out

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries and they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"


She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway
A runaway


I'm in the flow and I'm H-O
Hope ain't no I in the way
But if there is then let me say
That I'm blind to it all
Like I was born yesterday
And I'm allergic to the fakeness
It's all around me
Everywhere I look
And even though I may not
Know ya I'll still leave ya
Fucked up like some good advice


She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway
A runaway


Just know when you grow up
The places you goin'
To go off and try and make a way
Not really knowin'
The role that life is goin' play
And I ain't even see my
Kids in a damn month of Sundays
And I ain't been to church
And forever so she
Wanna dress nice and fix her hair everyday
Oh she wants to be just like her mom
Every since her husband left
She had to pick up and start again
Workin' late at night
Comin' home to the kids
Stressin' while she's knockin' on wood
Hopin' that they don't end up
On the list of kids that's missin' out for good


She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway yeah
She's a runaway
A runaway


They say you're not fit to
Wash their clothes not fit to
Go to their school not fit to
Be in their world
I forgive but don't forget girl
Keep your head up and handle it
And don't cry because you're fed up
Cry because you're happy it happens


I know it's hard but
We'll get by it just don't let
Them control your life
That's just how I feel
It's time to take a stand and
Take back your life piece by piece
I'm a grown man and I ain't got time
For all these games and gimmicks
I'm tryna set an example
Let you know you're not alone
Holler if you need me
I'll be there when I can
And don't get down on yourself
And let the system do their thing
I know it don't seem
Fair but keep your head up
And handle it as a man

Don't nobody understand you
We're here for you
Don't nobody understand you

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Rockstar" by Nickelback:

I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be

Tell me what you want
I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub
Big enough for ten plus me

Yeah so what you need
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At fifty thousand feet

Been there done that
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

So how you gonna do it
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair hey hey
I wanna be a rockstar

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can quit my day job
And we can all just die young

Been there done that
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial well

Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna make you bend and break It sends you to me without wait
Say a prayer but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show Let the good times roll let the good times roll

And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is"
If that's the worst you got better put your fingers back to the keys

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night yeah and one more time
Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories
"See he tastes like you only sweeter"

Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball
It's always cloudy except for Except for

When you look into the past look into the past
One night stand one night stand off
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night yeah and one more time one more night one more time
Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories see he tastes like you only sweeter

They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood whoa

One night and one more time One more night one more time
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night one more night yeah and one more time One more time I promise after that I'll let you go
Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories See he tastes like you only sweeter

One night and one more time One more night one more time
Thanks for the memories even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night one more night yeah and one more time One more time I promise after that I'll let you go
Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories See he tastes like you only sweeter

I never felt nothing in the world like this before  
Now I'm missing you and I'm wishing that you would come back through my door  
Why did you have to go  
You could have let me know so now I'm all alone  
Girl you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance  
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand  
And all my tears they keep running down my face  
Why did you turn away  
So why does your pride make you run and hide  
Are you that afraid of me  
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside  
This is not how you want it to be  
So baby I will wait for you  
'Cause I don't know what else I can do  
Don't tell me I ran out of time  
If it takes the rest of my life  
Baby I will wait for you  
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true  
I really need you in my life  
No matter what I have to do I'll wait for you  
Been a long time since you called me How could you forget about me  
You gotta be feeling crazy how can you walk away  
Everything stays the same I just can't do it baby  
What will it take to make you come back  
Girl I told you what it is and it just ain't like that  
Why can't you look at me You're still in love with me  
Don't leave me crying  
Baby why can't we just just start over again  
Get it back to the way it was  
If you give me a chance I can love you right  
But you're telling me it won't be enough  
So baby I will wait for you  
'Cause I don't know what else I can do  
Don't tell me I ran out of time  
If it takes the rest of my life  
Baby I will wait for you  
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true  
I really need you in my life  
No matter what I have to do I'll wait for you  
So why does your pride make you run and hide  
Are you that afraid of me  
But I know it's a lie what you're keeping inside  
That's not how you want it to be  
Baby I will wait for you  
Baby I will wait for you  
If it's the last thing I do  
Baby I will wait for you  
'Cause I don't know what else I can do  
Don't tell me I ran out of time  
If it takes the rest of my life  
Baby I will wait for you  
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true  
I really need you in my life  
No matter what I have to do I'll wait for you

Honey why you calling me so late
It's kinda hard to talk right now
Honey why you crying Is everything okay
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud

Well my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes I've dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me
Will it start a fight
No I don't think she has a clue

Well my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information
Oh they can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love ya baby
Tell me how you love me more
And how you think I'm sexy baby
But you don't want nobody else
You don't want this guy
You don't want that guy
You wanna touch yourself when you see me
Tell me how you love my body
And how I make you feel baby
You wanna roll with me
You wanna hold with me
You wanna stay warm and get out of the cold with me


I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love ya baby
I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love ya baby


Baby you're the perfect shape
Baby you're the perfect weight
Treat me like my birthday
I want it this way
I want it that way
I want it sideways
If we don't have all night
Baby give me it all night
I'll make you feel right
Baby can't you see
Girl we were meant to be

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love ya baby
I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love ya baby


All that I want
Is want to be close to you
All that I need
Is want to be close to you

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love ya baby
I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love ya baby
From underneath the trees we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are we're here tonight

Singing Amen I I'm alive
Singing Amen I I'm alive


If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

And I'm singing
Amen I Amen I I'm alive
Amen I Amen I Amen I I'm alive

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

Singing Amen I I'm alive
Singing Amen I I'm alive



If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died

We'd see the day we'd see the day


When nobody died
Yeah Remixx Remixx


I-I-I-I can make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie and Ices
In a Ferrari switching lanes
And I ain't stopping till the morning light
I can have you glistening in ice
I can put you in a position
That you ain't never felt in life
See your lips are telling me yes
While you're kissin' on my neck
Making me feel so
Should I stay should I go I don't know
The way you're dancing makes me wanna get close
To you and grind slow

Ok she wants me she wants me not
I'm gon' give her everything and get what I got
She wants me she wants me not
I'm gon' give her everything and get what I got
Yeah we good together like champagne and caviar
She wanna shop with no limit bawling like Ewing
Her mom's Dominican pop's Puerto Rican
Switching hand signals so they always speakin'


I can make your body start to tremble when we're grinding
I can make you see God baby when I make you come alive
Got my mind on money
And I ain't tripping on you
I'm sipping on something
And I'm tipping on 22's
And I'm gon' take you to my crib
And I'm gon' lay you on my bed
And I'm gon' break you off what you need
We'll be making love like professionals

And that's it that's all
I can't hope for nothing more
Man he shoulda never let me go in that store
Tellin' me I can change anything I want
And my girl still can't decide on what she want
And her friends in the back screamin' Shawty let's go
And I'ma be like 'If she wanna leave then let's go'
I got a chick named Sickle Cell
And she do what the head say
And when the head say 'I bust' she make the bed break
Hey girl you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down
Cover up with make up in the mirror
Tell yourself it's never gonna happen again
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you
Do you feel like a man when you push her around
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
Well I'll tell you my friend one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down a new life she has found
Face down in the dirt she said "This doesn't hurt"
She said "I've finally had enough"
Face down in the dirt she said "This doesn't hurt"
She said "I've finally had enough"
One day she will tell you that she has had enough
It's coming round again
Do you feel like a man when you push her around
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
Well I'll tell you my friend one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down a new life she has found
Do you feel like a man when you push her around
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
Well I'll tell you my friend one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down a new life she has found
Face down in the dirt she said "This doesn't hurt"
She said "I've finally had enough"
Face down in the dirt she said "This doesn't hurt"
She said "I've finally had enough"
Verse 1:
Lately I been runnin' outta of lean outta of lean
Truithfully I just been runnin' outta of fiends outta fiends
Iced out medallions I rock baggy jeans baggy jeans
All in the club now stackin' my cheese stackin' my cheese
Ran outta drank so I start to leave start to leave
And then I saw her partner mouth piece her mouthpiece
She said "What it do" I said "What's up"
She said "Can ya come and scoop me around 12:30"

Chorus:
Cause "Baby you know the way I live"
"You know I gotta get it by any means" by any means
"Each and every day it's grindin' all day"
"This hustle money won't stop so it's grindin' always"
"You know the way I live"

Verse 2:
By the age of 21 I was on my own on my own
Three years later I'm the owner of a home of a home
Three to four platinum artists that's piped out piped out
Wakin' up feelin' like I don't know what life 'bout life 'bout
That's why I'm in the booth that's why I'm in the streets in the streets
I take advantage of what's beef and what's sweet what's sweet
I gotta hustle hard I gotta get it right
"Baby Boy da Prince" ain't nobody truer that night

Chorus:
Cause "Baby you know the way I live"
"You know I gotta get it by any means" by any means
"Each and every day it's grindin' all day"
"This hustle money won't stop so it's grindin' always"
"You know the way I live"

Verse 3:
Now everybody know me you know what I'm sayin'
They talkin' 'bout the bad seed now they sayin' I'm changin' I'm changin'
When you make a mil everybody hands out hands out
And when you fall off then they jumpin' and shoutin' shoutin'
But they don't understand they don't really know really know
How hard it is tryna hustle up before the money get low get low
They get mad when they see that I won't extend won't extend
And they don't understand that I'm tryna stack ends stack ends

Chorus:
Cause "Baby you know the way I live"
"You know I gotta get it by any means" by any means
"Each and every day it's grindin' all day"
"This hustle money won't stop so it's grindin' always"
"You know the way I live"

Outro:
You know what I'm sayin' this your boy Baby Boy da Prince
And once again it's on you know the way I live let's go

I know a part of me will be gone 
Oh no I'll let go of you with her I'll survive 
And she says to me what she means to say 
And I watch her as she turns away 
And I have nothing left to say 
But you remain you remain 
and if you remember 
If you've no use and you don't need me 
then I'm everything you've failed to be 
You say it could be worse 
The curse word "low" have lyrics "It was ending" "part will be" "let go" and "watch her" respectively in place of their vulgar variants
All right here are the uncensored lyrics for "A Bay Bay" by Hurricane Chris:


A Bay Bay A Bay Bay

You wanna know what we say in the club A Bay Bay
White Tees Nikes and plus bottles of Bud A Bay Bay
All the girls looking A Bay Bay
Hating on the n***a who be A Bay Bay


I'm in the club hollering A Bay Bay
Shorty trying to get up all in my face mane A Bay Bay
I'm like "Hey baby I ain't got no money"
I'm broke baby I ain't got nothing A Bay Bay
Back then they didn't want me now I'm hot hoes all on me
Now I'm on all these n***as wanna clone me
Plate of Patron got ya boy in the zone mane A Bay Bay


You wanna know what we say in the club A Bay Bay
White Tees Nikes and plus bottles of Bud A Bay Bay
All the girls looking A Bay Bay
Hating on the n***a who be A Bay Bay


Brand new car but it ain't no Jaguar
'Cause that's how much a n***a love trappin' hard
Went to the mall and I balled like a athlete
Throw it back Lil' Mama show me what you workin' with
Got a whole six pack plus a mini brick
Two chicks A Bay Bay you know what it is
Fourteen grams just bought a half
See me in the club you dance you laugh A Bay Bay


You wanna know what we say in the club A Bay Bay
White Tees Nikes and plus bottles of Bud A Bay Bay
All the girls looking A Bay Bay
Hating on the n***a who be A Bay Bay


A Bay Bay A Bay Bay
A Bay Bay A Bay Bay

Want to but I can't help it
I love the way it feels
This got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it
I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday
Knowing that I won't

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did I don't know if I would quit
But I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
And I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all because of you

And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug
Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time
I'ma get me some
Know I should stay away from
'Cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession
Won't let me leave

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did I don't know if I would quit
But I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
And I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all because of you

And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because 

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did I don't know if I would quit
But I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
And I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all because of you

And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I try to get away
But trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow


You already know how it goes
Bang bang gotta make that money man
It's been the same old thang
Same song I'm hustling man
I gotta get that pot of gold that's why I'm out here chasing cash cash
Ain't nothing in my corner but these crooked-ass cops cops
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids so we grow up fast we grow up fast
Money's the only thing we see faithfully faithfully
Every day we gotta make cheese that's just the way it be
We gotta stack our ends don't you pretend
That you didn't notice the way we made it
The game we played it we played it
We gotta get that money man it's still the same

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I try to get away
But trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow


You know that everyday hussle go and get it up
Or work out on the block gotta live it up
You can catch me at the store that's if you ain't knowin' that
I've run amok I've been a struggler since I was a young buck young buck
I've been in and out of trouble but I'm trying to stop all that
If I can hustle up some change hope I can get the top all back
First to the fame it was nothin' like the feelin'
now everybody screamin' my name Layzie
Wishin' everybody loved me
Poppin' up they come to see me
Long as I stay strong so many sacrifices
Been made so I get on my knees every night and pray

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I try to get away
But trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow


Well I'm that diamond in the dirt
That ain't been found
I'm that underground king
That ain't been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
I'm the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga go 'head lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist
Chippin' my shoulder top clip cocked hopin' police sirens will yawn us
They can't separate us but they can't stand us
Whatever label they put on us I'm still a thug nigga
I tried so hard
But I'm still here in my pain


But you know we can do it again we can do it again
Alright alright we can do it again we can do it again
One day you will see all of my pain all of my pain
All of my pain all of my pain
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band

He said "Son when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned"

He said "Will you defeat them
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made"

"Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade"

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band

He said "Son when you grow up
You will be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned"

Sometimes I get the feeling
She's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go

Went through it all
The rise and fall
The bodies in the streets

And when you're gone we want you all to know

We'll carry on
We'll carry on

And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it

The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling
From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all

So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear

Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on
We'll carry on

And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on

And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears

Ooh oh oh oh

Disappointed faces of your peers

Ooh oh oh oh

Take a look at me cause I could not care at all

Do or die you'll never make me

Because the world will never take my heart

Go and try you'll never break me

We want it all we wanna play this part

Won't explain or say I'm sorry

I'm unashamed I'm gonna show my scar

Give a cheer for all the broken

Listen here because it's who we are

I'm just a man I'm not a hero

Just a boy who had to sing this song

I'm just a man I'm not a hero

I don't care

We'll carry on

We'll carry on

And though you're dead and gone believe me

Your memory will carry on

We'll carry on

And though you're broken and defeated

Your weary widow marches on

We'll do it all  
Everything  
On our own  

We don't need  
Anything  
Or anyone  

If I lay here  
If I just lay here  

Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world  

I don't quite know  
How to say  
How I feel  

Those three words  
Are said too much  
They're not enough  

If I lay here  
If I just lay here  

Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world  

Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden that's bursting into life  

Let's waste time  
Chasing cars  
Around our heads  

I need your grace  
To remind me  
To find my own  

If I lay here  
If I just lay here  

Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world  

Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden that's bursting into life  

All that I am  
All that I ever was  
Is here in your perfect eyes  
They're all I can see  

I don't know where  
Confused about how as well  
Just know that these things  
Will never change for us at all  

If I lay here  
If I just lay here  

Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world

I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place

It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes I always know
That you make me smile please stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my windowpane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Underneath the covers stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

It starts in my toes make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes I always know
That you make me smile please stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way
I just mmm

And it starts in my toes makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes I always know
That you make me smile please stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile baby just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever wherever wherever you go
Wherever wherever wherever you go
Wherever wherever you go

Messin’ around with chicks

Nothing to lose we both paid the cost

You took my hand you showed me how  
You promised me you'd be around  
Uh-huh that's right  
I took your words and I believed  
In everything you said to me  
Yeah-huh that's right  
If someone said three years from now  
You'd be long gone  
I'd stand up and punch them up  
'Cause they're all wrong  
I know better  
'Cause you said forever  
And ever  
Who knew  

Remember when we were such fools  
And so convinced and just too cool  
Oh no no no  
I wish I could touch you again  
I wish I could still call you friend  
I'd give anything  
When someone said count your blessings now  
'Fore they're long gone  
I guess I just didn't know how  
I was all wrong  
They knew better  
Still you said forever  
And ever  
Who knew  

Yeah yeah  
I'll keep you locked in my head  
Until we meet again  
Until we  
Until we meet again  
And I won't forget you my friend  
What happened  

If someone said three years from now  
You'd be long gone  
I'd stand up and punch them up  
'Cause they're all wrong and  
That last kiss  
I'll cherish

Zone 4 haha
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab I won't go go go

I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab I won't go go go

The man said why do you think you're here
I said I got no idea
I'm gonna I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near

He said I just think you're depressed
Kiss me yeah baby and go rest

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just ooh I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab I won't go go go
The door is closed and you're all alone
With the dope of this life that you have known
Tell me pretty lies look me in the face
Tell me that you love me even if it's fake
'Cause I don't freaking care at all
You've been out all night I don't know where you've been
You're slurring all your words not making any sense
But I don't freaking care at all
'Cause honey I'm not your honey pie
I've been wasting all my breath on your
And again and again but now I'm saying goodbye
Goodbye
So this is the end I'll pack up my bags and go
This is something that I've gotta do
I'll be looking for you hope you'll be looking for me too
Do you know do you know
And it's one more day up in the can
And you're waiting on freedom just to fail again
And you do your time playing with your mind
And you pray to God that he hears you cry
'Cause you're wasting all your tears on me
I'm not the girl you think I ought to be
So I'll pack up my bags I'll move out of your view
You need a puppet and I'm not one to you
But still I see it all in you
And I’ll be waiting for you baby
'Cause we both know who's right
But we're still on the run
As the sun goes down we'll make it out this time
I'll be ready I'll be waiting
Counting the minutes just to see you again

Verse 1
I like where we are
When we drive in your car
I like where we are here

Chorus
Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Our lips can touch here

Verse 2
Well you are the one the one that lies close to me
Whisper's "Hello I've missed you quite terribly"
I fell in love in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

Chorus
Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Our lips can touch here

Bridge
Well you are the one the one that lies close to me
Whisper's "Hello I've missed you quite terribly"
I fell in love in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

Chorus
Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Verse 1:
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I'm just getting in I knock on the door
A voice sweet and low says "Who is it"
She opens up the door and lets me in never once asking where I've been
She says "Are you hungry are you thirsty Are you tired are you horny"
I said "Yeah"
She says "Well come on sexy and I'll give you everything"

Chorus:
Dial my number hotline
Call me up anytime
I'll be there for you
Write my number on the wall
For a good time just call
I'll be there for you

Verse 2:
The operator said "What city please"
I said "Atlanta GA"
She said "Alright putting you through"
Seconds later a voice says "Hello"
I said "Hi who am I speaking to"
She said "Jazmyn"
I said "Jazmyn can I come see you"
She said "Sure baby come on through"
We could make love and she'll be screaming out "You just don't know what you're doing to me"

Chorus:
Dial my number hotline
Call me up anytime
I'll be there for you
Write my number on the wall
For a good time just call
I'll be there for you

Bridge:

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "First Time" by Lifehouse:

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer

Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver

Somethin' special unforgettable
50 Cent Cent Justin tin Timbaland land goddamn damn
She she she want it I wanna give it to her
She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see you break it down
I'm ballin' throwin' money around


She work it girl she work the pole
She break it down she take it low
She fine as hell she about the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor

Make you want to touch it make you want to taste it
Have you lustin' for her go crazy face it

Look in my eyes see what I see
All these haters they mad that you with me
They don't like how we move they won't like how I win
But I bet you they'll love me if I lose


Her body's like a work of art
Got the kind of body that make you stay smart
Got the kind of body that make a player play
Hate to see her go but love to watch her leave
Bentley Coupe new Phantom the audemars
Her body's like a jewel I'm lookin' for the heart

Verse 1:
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing don't know why I do

Chorus:
He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Verse 2:
Drew talks to me I laugh cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

Chorus:
He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Verse 3:
Drew walks by me can he tell that I can't breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

Chorus:
He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Outro:

And she's got everything that I have to live without
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say oh

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me when will I really see
All that I need to look inside
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me what do I really need
All that I need to look inside

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
Come back and hey oh
Look at what I say oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh
Whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

Ho

Went to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh
Whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey yeah yeah oh yeah come on
Sing it out
Sing it out

Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed

Changing numbers bought her things and now she's in LA with me
Now I'm smokin' on dank with a handful of cash
And got my hand on her thigh industries under my stash
In the back of my mind I hope she swallowin'
Every time she nail me like coffin
She got me off in the corner feelin' lost and
Got my hands on her hips baffled by her booty
Man I'm already drunk she say "What's ya name"

Verse 1: Killa C
Boys stop jocking
I'm doing the chicken head like it's Thanksgiving
Hold on I think I hear my phone beepin'
I got a text message it's just my baby daddy
He said "What you doin' I said "gettin' crunk"
He said "what's up with tonight" I said "I'm tryin' to f**k"
He said "Can I come through" I said "After two"
And I might charge you 200 just to rock my hips to the side like you do

Chorus: Diamond
Rock yo hips do it
Now lean back do it
Now walk it do it
Now stop do it
Now drop it do it


Verse 2: Princess
See I'm back with that gangsta click gangsta music
And you know we talk that stick talk that walk that sh*t
See I'm a crunk chick I love to hit my dance
It makes me lose control when I see them big plakatas
I'm jumpin' and stompin' I'm crunkin' and pumpin'
See I'm the crunk-a-lator that means I'm unstoppable
The dance floor is mine and I'm ready to rock
So MOB tell the DJ bring it back

Chorus: Diamond
Rock yo hips do it
Now lean back do it
Now walk it do it
Now stop do it
Now drop it do it


Verse 3: Lil Scrappy
Hey hey hey okay I stroll in the club with my hat low
I gotta read up on my swag gotta make sure it's right yo
I take one step in all the hoochies lookin'
I take two steps in all the thugs like "who said it"
I'm lookin' for a girl I could take home
I'm Tryna' phaze out like the latest phone
She make me wanna put a ringtone in her back
And then she speed it up and get on the back
Now lean wit' it rock wit' it
I'm fighting temptation but I'm concepting it
My momma always said "do what ya wanna do
But you better not break the law if you don't wanna lose"

Chorus: Diamond
Rock yo hips do it
Now lean back do it
Now walk it do it
Now stop do it
Now drop it do it

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky but I like it
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky but I like it
I'm freaky and I know it
But I'm not as freaky as she goes

Na-naked

Ohhh yeah yeah
Ohhh yeah yeah

So let's go
Especially to the dance floor
Ladies are lookin' lovely
From head to toe they know
Especially on the dance floor

So let's go
Especially to the dance floor
Ladies are lookin' lovely
From head to toe they know
Especially on the dance floor

Ohhh yeah yeah
Ohhh yeah yeah

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky I like the way you move
And she knows it I like the way you move
She's freaky I like the way you move
And I like it I like it

She's freaky I like the way you move
And she knows it I like the way you move

And I like it I like it

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows
I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good
It's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well I'm not paralyzed
But I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks
That will be cool with me
Well I'm still imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well I'm not paralyzed
But I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

Well I'm not paralyzed
But I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

Uh-huh this is for all my homeboys who went down you know what I'm saying
Uh-huh incarcerated parole probation and things of that nature
You know I'm still here contending for what it's worth
Looking for ways to make it better
Gotta get out the game
That's why I'm loving you right now baby
[Yea this one goes out to all my n----- that went through that struggle
Feel me]


All my life been po' but it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way n----- look at what they gave us
I never had a role model
I was serving fiends my coke bottle
And cutthroat where they get their coats off
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah


Ain't no more living in the dark we're making profit now
Fuck the park let's hit the charts
I got a number one with a bullet and you can't pull it
Open your eyes surprise n---- look who done did it
Started off legally split it then I got with Dre with it
Made some gangsta shit yeah and rocked with it
I put the coast on the map with Snoop Dogg and that's that
I'm still hitting corners in the 'llac f--- the jack
I'm trying to come up with another way to get paid
That's why I turned to the mic and started speaking the truth from the shade
And now it all makes sense a G with a little bit of negs
Now they saying it's all about my intelligence
I've been getting money for eighteen years it's evident
Hustle hard don't never give up baby that's prevalent


All my life been po' but it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way n----- look at what they gave us
I never had a role model
I was serving fiends my coke bottle
And cutthroat where they get their coats off


The homie did ten straight came home to a mansion and hot steak
And said he's never going back again and that's without a doubt friend
I put my life into this rap shit no jack shit that's on the real
I put the "G" in the game you tryna place a dip in me still
But I'm untouchable yeah I'm hirable
Blowing big sippin' something calm just like I'm on Diaxipam
I put my feet down down to the ground
I got these haters hating me trying to see me falling down
But ain't no slippin' no slippin' I stay grippin'
And drippin' hitting switches
And now they know that the big dog really did it
I fell off and bounced back
Me the king of the motherfucking coast now why would I lie about that


All my life been po' but it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way n----- look at what they gave us
I never had a role model
I was serving fiends my coke bottle
And cutthroat where they get their coats off


Yeah n---- so quit asking me "What do it take to be a G" Move
You gotta have heart first of all you understand me What
That's where we start from at you know what I'm saying
You gotta be a leader not a follower you know what I'm saying
Believe in yourself trust nobody but yourself you understand me partners
And uh keep pushing and striving for your own you know what I'm saying
And stay down for your crown baby; we rolls like that over here

Verse 1
Ballin' on these n***** like I'm Kobe
Brought out the champagne got the homies with me
And I'm poppin' bottles like I'm scoring touchdowns
And I'm fuckin' models till I'm passed out
Money coming fast my honeycomb hideout
Coolin' in my mansion bought my bitch a bigger house
Every time your girl hear my voice you wanna stick it out
She know I'm the king and she love that I be killin' shit

Chorus
We fly high no lie you know this Ballin'
Foreign rides outside it's like showbiz Our lifestyles armadillos we see them live
We stay fly no lie and you know this Ballin'
Hips and thighs oh my stay focused

Verse 2
Bitch no way I am become a victim
I pop out my roof call it Marilyn

Rollin' up my kush that OG poison in it
New York Giant nigga Eli Manning with it
We poppin' champagne like we won the championship
Look like I got on a CHiP costume
Fuck it I'm on one drum line boom boom

Chorus
We fly high no lie you know this Ballin'
Foreign rides outside it's like showbiz Our lifestyles armadillos we see them live
We stay fly no lie and you know this Ballin'
Hips and thighs oh my stay focused
In this farewell  
There's no blood  
There’s no alibi  
‘Cause I’ve drawn regret  
From the truth  
Of a thousand lies

So let mercy come  
And wash away  
What I've done

I'll face myself  
To cross out what I’ve become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what I’ve done

Put to rest  
What you thought of me  
While I clean this slate  
With the hands of uncertainty

So let mercy come  
And wash away  
What I've done

I'll face myself  
To cross out what I've become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done  
I start again  
And whatever pain may come  
Today this ends  
I'm forgiving what I've done

I'll face myself  
To cross out what I've become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what I've done

What I've done  
Forgiving what I've done

I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a flirt


Soon as I see her walk up in the club I'm a flirt
Winkin’ eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man lookin' at me damn right I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to me because I'm a flirt
And Baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause I'm a flirt
Please believe it unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because I'm a flirt


Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to
Rollin' like I supposed to
Shinin' like I supposed to
In the club fuckin' wit honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And wonderin' why all these players tryin' to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom nigga I'm gon' holla at her
A Dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt with all of y'all
Yeah yeah homie you say she yo girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'ma be like "cousin"
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff your bitch
'Cause hey I'm black handsome I sing plus I'm rich and I'm a flirt


Hey homie if you ain't gettin' no money
You better keep her away from me 'fore I take your honey
Man she be comin' every time I'm rollin' through
Homie gotta girlfriend then I bet she ain't fly like you
Man that's how you get messed up
Stop talkin' start walkin' like me and trust me
Her boyfriend's hatin' don't give a damn about him
They all be lovin' the way I be leanin' they thirsty for me
And they wanna get that love in
They better know that T-Pain Mike Jonesin'
Now I'ma flirt whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Penderazdoun I'm a flirt


Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to
Rollin' like I supposed to
Shinin' like I supposed to
In the club fuckin' wit honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And wonderin' why all these players tryin' to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom nigga I'm gon' holla at her
On that Kelly shit
Trying to get a number in my phone then trying to get me home
Maybe you can get me alone
But the homie ain't nothing like me
I'm Chuck Norris with a thing under my fitted it's sorta like a midget
I'm trying to tell you baby that them jokers lyin'
But I'm flyer than all the rest of them guys
In the club roasting them up
Put a toast in the sky "We got R Kelly in the house"
And we just made you throw your hands up and I'm a flirt
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say

That it's too late to apologize it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize it's too late

I'd take another chance take a fall take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new yeah yeah
I loved you with a fire red now it's turning blue
And you say sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize it's too late

Bridge guitar/piano

It's too late to apologize it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize it's too late

It's too late to apologize yeah
I said it's too late to apologize yeah

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground

That she used to say to me same girl same girl 
I'm convinced that she's a playa she's just playing games 
Convincing both of us to stay up 
And she's treating each of us like we're her only lover only lover 

Chorus: R Kelly and Usher 
Man I swear I'm in love with the same girl same girl 
I know it sounds crazy but it's true oh what can I do 
I'm in love with the same girl same girl 
And she's got me slipping got me tripping got me losing my cool 

Bridge: R Kelly and Usher 
I just can't seem to get her out of my head out of my head 
I'm thinking maybe I love her she just might be the one man oh 
But she's got me feeling like I'm the only one when I'm not the only one no 

Chorus: R Kelly and Usher 
Man I swear I'm in love with the same girl same girl 
I know it sounds crazy but it's true oh what can I do 
I'm in love with the same girl same girl 
And she's got me slipping got me tripping got me losing my cool 

Outro: R Kelly and Usher 
Same girl same girl 
But you let her handle the light don't matter 
All that ain't right same girl 
Same girl same girl same girl

Oh uh

'Cause I don't wanna waste my time

Uh huh

See me in the corner with my boys tryin' to drink you away

Uh huh

But it's like that oh oh

But I caught that look in your eye touching thighs in the crowded club

Uh huh

Tonight's maybe my lucky night

Uh huh

Uh huh check my phone

Got another call from a player wanna get with me

Uh huh I'm gonna hit you back

'Cause I'm busy yeah yeah

Working my connections trying to find the love

But then again don't you wanna have some fun

And you're not gonna reach my telephone

'Cause I'm out in the club

And you're not gonna reach my telephone

'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bub'

Beefin' with me you gon' have to get your man clowned
Fuck what your sayin' boys you better calm down
Before we go gorilla and stomp down in Buckhead
My pockets on bodybuilder status big as fuck
Brain on turpentine hand on my nuts
I rep the king and these are the things I must
If you cross the line it's beef you know you can't touch
I got my weight up now I'm doin' my reps
57 whip all black two-seater
This is what happens when trap niggas get money
Bought the Phantom just to make bitches say "oh he got money"
Got my whole click on the same page in due time

Big house long hallways thin walls yeah
Neighbors yelling and shit peep through the blindsellin' and shit
Dope boy swellin' the strip shootouts everyday you can tell it's the bricks
Choppin' elephants in the room drummin' like I'm in the service
Servin' all my ene-ma-nies I make you niggas nervous
Murda Murda gettin' all these birds up out this cage
Caught them and it hit the chopping board we parted ways
What part I'm from zone one where that champion road run
Shawty yeah I'm a star watch me make these grown men hold up
And get to jumpin' like there was something in they're cornflakes
I'm getting richer everyday they celebrate my more pay
Come on and ride for a nigga bust your gun while I'm busting mine
Slow motion with the potion you could bump it if you runnin' shy
If it's beef I'll re-up keep my gun and I keep tucked
I appear alive and well they feel like they ain't seen me enough


Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'

Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas pardon me I'm just poppin'

I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don’t worry 'cause
Everything’s gonna be alright

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Everything's gonna be alright

No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one

Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don’t worry 'cause
Everything’s gonna be alright

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Everything's gonna be alright

No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You you

Can get in the way of what I feel
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try try to divide us

But nothing can come between
You and I
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

I don't I don't I don't
No I don't I don't don't
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm

I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love
Finally it's happened to me
And I can't describe
How good it feels to be
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of
What I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Verse 1 Paula DeAnda:
Oh hey hey hey
Ah-ha hey hey
Ah-ha hey
Now baby we can talk all day
But if you ain't talkin' this money
I don't wanna talk don't wanna wait
I'ma do my thang I'ma get this cake
Rollin' with me I could show you things that
You gotta see to believe come on and
Take a chance make a move ain't no tellin'
What we can do ah

Chorus Paula DeAnda & The DEY:
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted
Girl no no no ah
So if you wanna be my baby
Just go and make your move ah
Break it down gotta lock it down
If you want me you need to be
Everything that I everything that I need
Won't you come and set me free
Just walk away just walk away
Just walk away just walk away
Just walk away just walk away
Just walk away still remember me

Verse 2 The DEY:
Yo come on and bounce with me
Sit back relax enjoy the view with me
Come take a cruise This AMG is too sick to be true
Come and see the plasma TV and the new recliner
Same color as the ACTIV which is me and my lifestyle
Not to mention the way I do it makes the guys like wow
Pictures of me and Paula on the nightstand
Two-way and two-car garages
You wouldn't believe how hard we are

Chorus

Verse 3 Paula DeAnda:
Now baby we can break up to make up I guess
But why go through the heartache and stress
Just be real and tell me what it is what it is
Are you feelin' my vibe Do you diggin' my style
Don't want the superficial things I just want to be your everything
If you're serious take it slow I'm not the type to jump and go

Chorus x2

Outro The DEY:
Just walk away just walk away just walk away just walk away
Verse 1:
I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed where your nightgown used to be

Chorus:
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

Verse 2:
While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room

Chorus:
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

Bridge:
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would have said it's over
And I can't pretend
I won't think about you when I'm older
'Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end

Chorus:
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

Outro:
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Don't know if I can face this pain much longer
And I'm not getting better
Trying to hold on but it's getting harder

I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her you think of me
I would never wish bad things but I don't wish you well
Could you tell by the flames that burned your words
I never read your letter 'cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer repent and pray
Well you had your chance didn't you
There's only so many times I can let you in


But you can't call me up when you're broken like my heart
Oh and you can't knock on my door so I won't let you in
You'll have to crawl on my floor so that's where you'll stay
Until you learn that your worth ain't half of what I've paid
I'm done with you sucker I'm done with you
Gonna be hard to love someone else I need a moment to
Be by myself just be by myself
I'm gonna get so high I'm gonna take my time
But I'm done with you sucker I'm done with you


I hope the ring you gave to her brings her fame
And fortune Somethin' that we never had
I'll let karma do the dirty work of gettin' you back
I'd never say revenge is sweet but I want to pay back
Finally I'm through wasting all of my time on you
I'm through wasting all of my time on you


But you can't call me up when you're broken like my heart
Oh and you can't knock on my door so I won't let you in
You'll have to crawl on my floor so that's where you'll stay
Until you learn that your worth ain't half of what I've paid
I'm done with you sucker I'm done with you
Gonna be hard to love someone else I need a moment to
Be by myself just be by myself
I'm gonna get so high I'm gonna take my time
But I'm done with you sucker I'm done with you


I'm done with you
Forget about the memories of us in Central Park
Summer days laughin' in the afternoon
You pushed me away you weren't so heartbroken then
Forget about the memories of us in Central Park
Summer days laughin' in the afternoon
You pushed me away you weren't so heartbroken then
Not so heartbroken then
Now I'm gone now I'm gone


You can't call me up when you're broken like my heart
Oh and you can't knock on my door so I won't let you in
You'll have to crawl on my floor so that's where you'll stay
Until you learn that your worth ain't half of what I've paid
I'm done with you sucker I'm done with you You
Gonna be hard to love someone else I need a moment to
Be by myself just be by myself Myself
I'm gonna get so high I'm gonna take my time
But I'm done with you sucker I'm done with you
You can't call me up
But you can't call me up
You can't call me up
When you're broken like my heart

Verse 1:
I've been looking for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean

Pre-Chorus:
So if you feel it let me know know know
Come on now what you waiting for for for
My engine's ready to explode explode explode
So start me up and watch me go go go

Chorus:
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves Can you run all the lights
If you can baby boy then we can go all night
Cause it's zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys now shut up and drive drive drive
Shut up and drive drive drive

Verse 2:
I got a taste for danger if you're with me
Then give me all your love and give me your keys
And we'll be tearing up the highway like a big old monster truck
I'm gonna get you where you're going in a hurry baby

Pre-Chorus:
So if you feel it let me know know know
Come on now what you waiting for for for
My engine's ready to explode explode explode
So start me up and watch me go go go

Chorus:
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves Can you run all the lights
If you can baby boy then we can go all night
Cause it's zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys now shut up and drive drive drive
Shut up and drive drive drive

Bridge:
Cause you play the pedal I'll play the shifter
And if we get together yeah go on and hit me
Boy I'm a teaser shock absorber
If you're with me pick me up and take me like a helicopter

Chorus:
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves Can you run all the lights
If you can baby boy then we can go all night
Cause it's zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys now shut up and drive drive drive
Shut up and drive drive drive
