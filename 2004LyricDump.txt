Be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave ready to leave
But I gotta keep it real now cause on a one to ten

I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to

What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn


It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin'
But we done been fell apart

Really wanna work this out
But I don't think ya gonna change ya
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways

Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn


When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn burn burn burn
Let it burn
Oh gotta let it burn


Deep down you know it's best for yourself
But you hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn


Deep down you know it's best for yourself
But you hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn


I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry yeah
Ooh oh ooh ooh
Ooh uh-huh ooh uh-huh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh


Would it be Could it be
That I'm losing my mind all the time

I think that you should let it burn oh

But you know gotta let it go cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn burn burn
Let it burn oh gotta let it burn
Some people live for the fortune  
Some people live just for the fame  
Some people live for the power yeah  
Some people live just to play the game  
Some people think that the physical things  
Define what's within  
And I've been there before  
But that life's a bore  
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all  
But I don't want nothing at all  
If it ain't you baby  
If I ain't got you baby  
Some people want diamond rings  
Some just want everything  
But everything means nothing  
If I ain't got you yeah

Some people search for a fountain  
Promises forever young  
Some people need three dozen roses  
And that's the only way to prove you love them  
Hand me the world on a silver platter  
And what good would it be  
With no one to share with no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all  
But I don't want nothing at all  
If it ain't you baby  
If I ain't got you baby  
Some people want diamond rings  
Some just want everything  
But everything means nothing  
If I ain't got you you you  
If I ain't got you with me baby  
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing  
If I ain't got you with me baby

Some people want it all  
But I don't want nothing at all  
If it ain't you baby  
If I ain't got you baby  
Some people want diamond rings  
Some just want everything  
But everything means nothing  
If I ain't got you yeah

If I ain't got you with me baby  
Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing  
If I ain't got you with me baby
Boom boom boom
Heh Heh

Verse 5: Big Boi
The whole room fell silent
The girls all pause with glee
Turning left turning right
Are you turning me
Yes of course I'll run down to you
Woman I'll be shaking out of my pants
Every time you dance
Dance dance dance dance ooh-ooh
Swaying to the band moving to the beat
Feeling so damn hypnotized take me now baby trance
Should we goDance partner your my essence
And your presence is so needed
At the Riviera or in my casa I'm gonna get you in a third
Position like a sprinter
Tongue-kissing and hugging
I'm tryin to remember
Just how low I can enter
When you come back and talking that sh*t
Said that you was creepin' with the enemy
The ceremonials over buttered peas and rice
But hurry up and get ready girl
I'm tryin to get some before tonight
Smelling like  Marie Calendars
Appetite for affection
And I'm hungry like Marvin Gaye is for some sexual healing
So come on and be my private dancer dancer dancer

Chorus: Sleepy Brown
1 - I love the way you move
I love the way you move Whoo-o-o 

One two three uh


My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so and this I know for sho
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door


Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Uh thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how


Hey ya Hey ya
Hey ya Hey ya
You think you've got it
Oh you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together
Oh we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is "nothing is forever"
Then what makes then what makes then what makes
Then what makes then what makes then what makes
Love the exception
So why oh why oh
Why oh why oh why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here


Y'all don't wanna hear me you just wanna dance

Every time I was in LA I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called I told you "Baby I'm working"
No wonder why I was in the studio late night
Workin' on the songs that I write
All because I had a secret


Only part of the reason I'm confessin' this
I just wanna let you know that I've been doin' wrong
Don't wanna sing it on this microphone
But baby I gotta let you know somehow oh


I guess that's part of bein' grown
Missin' moments that should've been our own
But you were always somewhere else
And I was at the studio tryna get to where I was at
I said it'd be alright if I had one last play
But baby that was a foul play on me I gotta say
I know I made mistakes and I had a few regrets
But it's never too late to start again so if you want to we can


Only part of the reason I'm confessin' this
I just wanna let you know that I've been doin' wrong
Don't wanna sing it on this microphone
But baby I gotta let you know somehow oh


Everywhere I go I see my ex's face
Every time I'm tryna get with you you're in the back of my mind
I'm tryna let you know that I'm better off tryna be here for you
You always overlookin' the fact that I love you
I know that you got issues from a past due
But they ain't got shit to do with me right
That's right we argue and we fight
I said things that I didn't mean but there you go
Bringin' up any and everything as an excuse
But you need to know that I'm no good without you


Only part of the reason I'm confessin' this
I just wanna let you know that I've been doin' wrong
Don't wanna sing it on this microphone
But baby I gotta let you know somehow oh


Just once just once I wanna make it right
I wanna start over baby I wanna be a good man
Oh I wanna do it right this time yeah
Just once I wanna do it right


Only part of the reason I'm confessin' this
I just wanna let you know that I've been doin' wrong
Don't wanna sing it on this microphone
But baby I gotta let you know somehow oh


I'm tryna be a man but damn it's so tough
I'm sorry for what I've done to you what I've put you through
Baby please forgive me for what I'm about to say right now this way
But I've been sleepin' with your friend

Something for my people in the 3rd world
I'm trying to get some new money all my old money been unfurled
Ghetto commission you know my position
Anything in the world nigga ain’t no competition
When I catch feelings I put it in the pen
And these other rappers hate me like the devil hates sin
I ride for my niggas I'ma die for my niggas
See the difference between me and you you ain't high as my niggas
Been there done that that's old news
I got a new bitch and my old hoe a fool
So cool better yet cold
But I'm a hot boy juvenile you know how the story go


Slow motion for me slow motion for me
Slow motion for me move in slow motion for me
Slow motion for me slow motion for me
I'm tryna put this bad living in slow motion for me


It's wide open and I can't keep it stable
I'm reaching out but I'm unable
To grab a hold of something that I once had
And I realize that this is just a small fragment
Of what it used to be as I hustle for a living
And reminisce at night about eating in the kitchen
I remember roaches running everywhere beer bottles on the floor
But now I'm getting money so you know I got the glow
I'm hard-core but I got a heart full of gold
You know how it is living in the ghetto
When your back's against the wall you gon' do what you need to do
And every step that you take makes a heavy foot fall


Slow motion for me slow motion for me
Slow motion for me move in slow motion for me
Slow motion for me slow motion for me
I'm tryna put this bad living in slow motion for me


Let's get it started let's go on with the show
I'm from the ghetto it ain't no boys when niggas say "no"
I see you haters talking but I ain't hearing what you said
What the fuck a hating-ass nigga gotta do with my bread
I show you love you show me hate
How we supposed to function when we can't relate
I'm doing shows getting money it's all good
And I'm thinking about grabbing a pint knocking on some wood


Slow motion for me slow motion for me
Slow motion for me move in slow motion for me
Slow motion for me slow motion for me
I'm tryna put this bad living in slow motion for me


Slow motion for me move in slow motion for me

A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same

But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face
I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me yeah

The miles just keep rollin'
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go oh yeah

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl there's only you and me

Everything I know and anywhere I go oh whoa
It gets hard but it won't take away my love oh whoa

And when the last one falls
When it's all said and done
It gets hard but it won't take away my love whoa whoa whoa

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me yeah
Oh yeah oh whoa
Girl it's something 'bout this 
Lil' cutie I'm feeling  
Her whole style and swag 
And the way she wears her hair  
And I don't know what it is  
But I'mma rip off her skirt 
And baby I'mma make you feel brand new  
First I take you out then we make sweet love  
Yo' body's smoking got me all choked up  
Be mine Valentine in the summer or winter 
You drive me crazy I was thinking 'bout "Sex Over the Phone"  
Now I'm 'bout to take it to the dome  
And get my groove on get my groove on  
Get my groove on get my groove on  

Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Twista  
We be up all night laying tracks  
You sleeping let me kick it with the slow jams  
I'll break it down in English so you can slow jam  
Let your man be the slow jam  
I'll be the Ice Cream Man come and get a scoop  
Get your girl in the mood  
Then I'll have you climbing up the walls  
Doing the slow jam  

Verse 2: Kanye West  
It's three o'clock and the party's still going  
And these Chicago n***** ain't never slowing  
Uh huh you say you know how this one goes  
I don't even need the music from the block I own it  
Uh huh you say you know I ain't rolling  
David Banner would've told you I don't play  
Now let me hit it from the back girl  
I won't catch a hernia bust off on your couch  
Now you got Seaman's furniture  
Ain't that a shame twisted up your whole frame  
Got you walking and looking lame  
Talking about you got a sore throat going  
But really it's from the deep throat blowing  

Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Twista  
We be up all night laying tracks  
You sleeping let me kick it with the slow jams  
I'll break it down in English so you can slow jam  
Let your man be the slow jam  
I'll be the Ice Cream Man come and get a scoop  
Get your girl in the mood  
Then I'll have you climbing up the walls  
Doing the slow jam  

Verse 3: Twista  
Now stop for a minute and think  
Cause this one's clever  
You might wanna hug me after this one  
The Temptations singing "Hey Pretty Lady"  
Let me take you to the '70s real quick  
Wham bam thank you ma'am  
It's the Twista with Kanye West on the slow jam  

Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Twista  
We be up all night laying tracks  
You sleeping let me kick it with the slow jams

Let your man be the slow jam  
I'll be the Ice Cream Man come and get a scoop  
Get your girl in the mood  
Then I'll have you climbing up the walls  
Doing the slow jam
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

Lil' Flip
Lea

whoo

uh
huh
Yeah

I'm Lil' Flip
I'm back with Lea
It's a new year
Ya know what I'm sayin'


Sunshine I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

Look I know you wanna chill with a player
But all you got to do is keep it real with a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll 'cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
With my homeboys but when it's time for me to call you
I'm like "Baby what you wanna do
I'm in the drop top bentley and I'm rolling with you"
I got the cheese and wine we gon' do it up
And if you wanna get your lovin' we can do it up

Sunshine I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine
Sunshine I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

You know my homeboyz call me young Flipper
And when I talk on the phone
Hoes be like "He's a big tipper"
I like to sip syrup and pop bean pills
But if you don't do that we can still share a meal
I'm lookin' for a lady that can take off her clothes
A lady that can jump on the dick and come back for more
I'm smoking hydro and I'm still on the grind
I'm from the clover I ain't hard to find
I'm Lil' Flip but call me Flipperachi
I'm with Lea eating sushi sipping saki
I'm in the club smokin' on a cigar
Me and my real niggaz we ain't looking for no broads
I'm like "Baby what you wanna do
I'm in the drop top Bentley and I'm riding with you"
I got the diamonds shining on my pinky and wrist
If you wanna be with me baby this is what you get

Sunshine I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine
Sunshine I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

Now the party is over I'm with my sweet thang
And as the day ends I'm doing my own thang
You can catch Lil' Flip riding in his own lane
And you can catch me in a Porsche switching my own brain
I'm smokin' the purple 'cause that's what I deserve
I'm taking medication man I got a lotta nerves
You gotta just face it the game is a reality
It's driving you crazy but you can't lose your sanity
We all got friends but some are just acquaintances
And if we wasn't rich they wouldn't be here they couldn't take the shit
I'm Lil' Flip I'm a ladies man
And if these hoes wanna roll with me they gotta understand

Sunshine I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine
Sunshine I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

Yeah
It's Lil' Flip
And Lea
Ha ha
We out baby
We out
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Dirt Off Your Shoulder" by Jay-Z: 

You're now tuned in to the motherfucking greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones

Tim you can go and brush your shoulder off nigga
I got you yeah

If you feeling like a pimp nigga go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all
Probably be locked by the force
Tryna hustle some things
That go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse
Feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law
Nigga griping my balls
All the ladies they love me
From the bleachers they screaming
All the ballers is bouncing
They like the way I be leaning
All the rappers be hating
Off the track that I'm making
But all the hustlers they love it
Just to see one of us make it

Came from the bottom of the bottom
To the top of the pops
Nigga London Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back get it Man I'm straight off the block
I could run it back nigga 'cause I'm straight with the Roc

If you feeling like a pimp nigga go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder

Your homie Hov' in position
In the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch
Trying to get me a Rover
Trying to stretch out the coca
Like a wrestler yessir
Keep the heckler close
You know them smokers'll test ya
But like fifty-two cards
Counting I'm like twenty-two cups
Minus two bras
Sound like forty-four bucks
Minus two clubs
See my dough is tight
Like I'm carrying a kilo
Plus I'm cruising in the six
Same colour as the hero

If you feeling like a pimp nigga go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder

Your boy back in the building
Back to back with the hits
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And love the way I feel now
I'm about to take over
Get a bigger house and a bigger pool
I'm about to upgrade from this silver to platinum
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothing to play with
Ugh ugh ugh ugh
Came from the bottom of the bottom
To the top of the pops
Niggas London Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back get it man I'm straight off the block
I could run it back nigga 'cause I'm straight with the Roc

If you feeling like a pimp nigga go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get
That dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get

And uh it's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know about y'all but I know about us

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "One Call Away" by Chingy ft J-Weav:


From the Midwest All I need is one of them thangs
To the East Coast That put it on me with no shame
From the dirty dirty I need a lady in the streets
To the West Coast One that'll do me real good and won't creep


Yo I'm in the club with my homies tryna get a lil' V-I
Keep it down on the low key low key
'Cause you know how it feels
I said "Shorty she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting my ear
You'd think that she knew me" knew me
So we decided to chill
Conversation got heavy she had me feeling like she's ready to blow watch out
Oh watch out
She's saying "Come get me" So I got up and followed her to the floor she said "Baby let's go"
When I told her let's go
I said "Yeah"
Shorty got down sayin' "Come and get me"
Yeah I got so caught up
I forgot she told me
Her name was Tasha
I'm in love with a stripper yo


From the Midwest All I need is one of them thangs
To the East Coast That put it on me with no shame
From the dirty dirty I need a lady in the streets
To the West Coast One that'll do me real good and won't creep


And I'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm in love with a stripper
She put that thang on me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm in love with a stripper


From the Midwest All I need is one of them thangs
To the East Coast That put it on me with no shame
From the dirty dirty I need a lady in the streets
To the West Coast One that'll do me real good and won't creep 
Repeat until fade

Me myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow that from now on I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me myself and I that's all I got in the end


It's a small small world
But you can't have it all
Yeah I'm doing it right I'm doing it right
You're just getting old
You're just getting old
And then you realize


Me myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow that from now on I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me myself and I that's all I got in the end


I don't know why I was so afraid
Nothing to fear but fear itself
It's like I've been playing games with myself
My own battles have been fought and won
I've been so busy being scared
But one day I woke up and realized


Me myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow that from now on I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me myself and I that's all I got in the end


Got my head on straight I got my vibe right
I'm gonna be alone tonight
Got my head on straight I got my vibe right
I'm gonna be alone tonight


Me myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry I took a vow that from now on I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me myself and I that's all I got in the end


Got my head on straight I got my vibe right
I'm gonna be alone tonight
Got my head on straight I got my vibe right
I'm gonna be alone tonight

I would be happy to provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "The First Cut Is the Deepest" by Sheryl Crow:

I would have given you all of my heart
But there’s someone who’s torn it apart
And he’s taken just all that I had
But if you want I’ll try to love again

Baby I’ll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest

But when it comes to being lucky he’s cursed
When it comes to lovin’ me he’s worst
But when it comes to being loved he’s first
That’s how I know you’ll lie you’ll lie to me

And when you say that you love me
Know that it doesn’t mean a thing

Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest

‘Cause when it comes to being lucky he’s cursed
When it comes to lovin’ me he’s worst
But when it comes to being loved he’s first
That’s how I know you’ll lie you’ll lie to me

And when you say that you need me
Know that I’ll never leave you
Don't say words that you don't mean

Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know
The first cut is the deepest

‘Cause when it comes to being lucky he’s cursed
When it comes to lovin’ me he’s worst
But when it comes to being loved he’s first
That’s how I know you’ll lie you’ll lie to me
Baby baby baby
From the day I saw you
Really really wanted to catch your eye
Somethin' special 'bout you
I must really like you
Cause not a lotta guys are worth my time

Ooh baby baby baby
It's gettin' kinda crazy
Cause you are takin' over my mind

And it feels like ooh

You don't know my name
I swear it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go will you ever know
Ooh baby baby baby
I see us on our first date
You doin' everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh it set my soul on fire

Ooh baby baby baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's runnin' wild

And it feels like ooh

You don't know my name
And I swear it baby it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go will you ever know
How you gonna act like
We never met
You you know damn well
You don't forget
So so so so
Listen to me sugar

I don't know how you're gonna get away
But it's okay you can call it a day
And it ain't nothin' to say
Sorry you just don't know my name
Round and round and round we go will you ever know
And I swear on my mother and father
It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go will you ever know
And I swear it feels like
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 

I used to pride myself on bein' the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand that anything I'm offerin'
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguin'
From the time I picked you up until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
"It's all his fault" you say he trippin' you're gettin' mad and that's
And to the point of no return I'm feelin' like you're just using me
And I'm tired of being your part-time lover/Full-time friend
A homie Friend/Lover Oh/ is what you call me I introduced you to him
That's how we got closer we spent time to the point that I missed him
When you would go and see him you would never come and diss him
But I keep my hands out ya business Uh believe me I'm a different type of breed
Better yet a different type of need
You just need to make the call give me a chance to miss ya
It's all it's all

If you want to come to my house then just come on
And if you want to come to my house then just come on 
And if you want to come to my house then just come on come on come on 
And if you want to come to my house then just come on come on come on 

He don't know when you're sad he don't know when you're mad
Girl it's time to switch it up
I done had enough 'cause you ain't the girl I used to know
You say you're gonna change but everyday is the same
I'm watching while you're fussin' with him I'm waitin' on the sideline
Tell him he can get the hell on you don't need another guy
On again off again playa listed under friend
The way you switchin' position

If you want to come to my house then just come on
And if you want to come to my house then just come on
And if you want to come to my house then just come on come on come on 
And if you want to come to my house then just come on come on come on
If you want to leave instantly
That's the penalty you pay
But you need to understand that I'm the man
And your heart baby you need to give it to me 
Repeat 3x 

If you want to come to my house then just come on
And if you want to come to my house then just come on
And if you want to come to my house then just come on come on come on 
And if you want to come to my house then just come on come on come on

Oh you didn't think we could do it again
Twista Kanye West from Po Pimpin' to Poppin' tags
From Champion's the world to Slow Jamz
Oh baby we can even make you an overnight celebrity


Know what I'm saying
Come on baby
Uh girl I see you in them apple bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista let's make a movie
You know who I am the way I hooly
I'm the king of the chi and I ride high
Have a guy I can change your life
Come and talk to me I really wanna meet you girl
I really wanna know your name


Come and be my main chick
We don't need no love scene
We could accidentally make a baby
Right here on the floor


Girl you got me sprung and I don't care
But nobody else but you and me
In the middle of the dance floor I whisper in your ear
And tell you what you want to hear
Come on see about me you're making me wanna do it
And it's such a beautiful night we'll see what I'm going to do with it
It's enough room in the continental I wanna see you ride
Watch you get your freak out just come and jump inside


Come and be my main chick
We don't need no love scene
We could accidentally make a baby
Right here on the floor


I see you got the good goods I'm talking about your sports bra
The baddest thing up in here and you know it's you
You know who I'm talking to
Look everybody think they know you honey
But nobody knows you better than twista
Look girl you a superstar baby that's for sure
Got a lot of fame and fortune and that's something that you can't ignore


Come and be my main chick
We don't need no love scene
We could accidentally make a baby
Right here on the floor


Won't you come and be my main chick
We don't need no love scene
We could accidentally make a baby
Right here on the floor
Verse 1:
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Pre-Chorus:
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow

Chorus:
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Verse 2:
Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

Pre-Chorus:
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow

Chorus:
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Bridge:
And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

Chorus:
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Outro:
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else


I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more


I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved and she will be loved


Tap on my window knock on my door
And I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore


I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved and she will be loved

And she will be loved and she will be loved
And she will be loved and she will be loved


Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you  
Or tell you that  
But if I didn't say it  
Well I'd still have felt it  
Where's the sense in that 

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder  
Or return to where we were  

But I will go down with this ship  
And I won't put my hands up and surrender  
There will be no white flag above my door  
I'm in love and always will be  

I know I left too much mess and destruction  
To come back again  
And I caused nothing but trouble  
I understand if you can't talk to me again  

And if you live by the rules of "it's over"  
Then I am sure that that makes sense  

But I will go down with this ship  
And I won't put my hands up and surrender  
There will be no white flag above my door  
I'm in love and always will be  

And when we meet  
Which I'm sure we will  
All that was then  
Will be there still  

I'll let it pass  
And hold my tongue  
And you will think  
That I've moved on  

I will go down with this ship  
And I won't put my hands up and surrender  
There will be no white flag above my door  
I'm in love and always will be 

I will go down with this ship  
And I won't put my hands up and surrender  
There will be no white flag above my door  
I'm in love and always will be

Vámonos pues al cielo
Pura buena onda todo tranquilo
Brilla el sol como oro
Nunca se acaba el amor es eterno
Es muy bello es muy simple
Es muy fácil como un juego
Brilla el sol y la luna
Y las estrellas con los dos juntos


How far is Heaven
¿Y dónde está ¿Y dónde está
And I know that I need to be there
¿Qué he hecho mal ¿Qué he hecho mal
Para estar así ¿corazón sin hogar ¿Corazón sin hogar


Aquí estoy pronto voy
Donde siempre hay risa y perdón
Hay amor no hay que pagar
Nada mas que una gran felicidad
Aquí aprendí a rezar
Sigo sufriendo no puedo más
El amor es como un sol
Que alumbra en la oscuridad


How far is Heaven
¿Y dónde está ¿Y dónde está
And I know that I need to be there
¿Qué he hecho mal ¿Qué he hecho mal
Para estar así ¿corazón sin hogar ¿Corazón sin hogar

Verse 1:
On a Monday I am waiting
Tuesday I am fading
And by Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
‘Cause you've come to rescue me

Chorus:
Fall with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath I hope it lasts
Ohhhh

Verse 2:
It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell

Chorus:
Fall with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath I hope it lasts
Ohhhh and it seems like
I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels

Bridge:
It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces pieces pieces of me
All the pieces pieces pieces of me

Chorus:
Fall with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath I hope it lasts
Ohhhh and it seems like
I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels

Outro:
All the pieces pieces pieces of me
All the pieces pieces pieces of me

Ludacris check me out
Cadillac grills Cadillac mills
Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
Matter of fact candy paint Cadillac kills
So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills
Twenty-inch wides iced out lampin'
Gone head and throw it out watch the candy paint drip off the frame
Twisted off the 'jae and we'll never be the same
Pimpin' ain't easy so I'ma play the game
These girls see me now and it's a race and they want a taste
They chasin' me down
And it's a daily routine since I was thirteen
A chubby nigga on the scene
Tryna get my hands on some pussy
Meaning the girls on my jock
So I got with some of them and told her
About my situation how I got through
And ran a different type of train on my Zoo
A lot of sucking and fucking all in the same night
A lot of niggas are soft but I yell "Let's fight"


You wanna be me
You gots to see me
Splash Waterfalls
And everything will be alright
You wanna be me
You gots to see me

Y'all I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Leer jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop
Oops
I'm interrupted by a doorbell three twenty
A little girl named Selena standin' on my steps
The way she work them hips and lick her lips
Make me wanna get a little bit tell me what's your name
She said my name is Selena plib to pursue her
I say why you comin' by yourself or are you with your girls
She said I'm with my baby mama move closer can I touch
She said Luda I said "I can't call it" and the scene unfolds
I'm smokin' on my indo I just finished fuckin' this window
Now I'm gettin' some hair from a hoe who loves to swallow
Ten minutes later I'm still deep in her tonsils
Young and thuggin' everytime I see her my nuts start juggin'
Gettin' the feeling the pussy's wetter than pudding
And right before I slip the Jimmy on the tip of my shit
She gets to runnin' her mouth scream and then I dip


You wanna be me
You gots to see me
Splash Waterfalls
And everything will be alright
You wanna be me
You gots to see me
S-P-L-A-S-H
Waterfalls Waterfalls


It's Friday night so everything is alright
The party is here on the west side
So I reach for my forty and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shelly Tailor 'bout to fill the thrills
Freshly dressed so I'm lookin' kinda tight and kind of nice
Feelin' lucky tonight though I might just find me a Halle Berry
Or maybe a Pamela Anderson or Carmen Elecktra all three will work
But now I'm reachin' my peak still feelin' kinda freaky
I'm just a bad boy gone clean watch me freak it
I'll spin you round and round and turn you upside down
I'll hold you tight now spread them baby let me see you ride
Now that you're full of that indo going to the sitento
Now you got a little of water let me sprinkle some it on your daughter
Tell your baby mama I'm comin' over to scoop her
And sneak her through the window call me Casanova


You wanna be me
You gots to see me
Splash Waterfalls
And everything will be alright
You wanna be me
You gots to see me

Verse 1:
We at war
We at war with terrorism racism but most of all we at war with ourselves
Jesus walk
God show me the way because the Devil's trying to break me down
Jesus walk with me
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
Jesus walk
And I don't think there's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
Jesus walk with me
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long

Chorus:
Jesus walk
Jesus walk with me

Verse 2:
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
That means guns sex lies video tapes
But if I talk about God my record won't get played huh
Well if this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

Chorus:
Jesus walk
Jesus walk with me
Jesus walk
Jesus walk with me
Jesus walk
And all my people that's drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money till it gets sky high
Jesus walk with me
Jesus walk
Jesus walk with me
Jesus walk
And all my people that's living in poverty
One day you'll be opening your Bentley doors
Jesus walk with me
Jesus walk
Jesus walk with me

Verse 3:
Now we can make it through anything if Magic made it
They say I'm rappin' like Big Jay and Tupac
Andre 3000 where is Erykah Badu at
Who dat who dat said they gonna beat Lil' Wayne
My verse is like church my Jesus piece
Now please domino domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will who drove the six
The same car Martin had in the "Will'-ay" video
I'm screaming so loud getting head like a blowfish
I'm Lil' Wayne but I ain't as young as I used to be
But still I'm a soldier soldier excuse me wtf I'm saying
Psychiatric ward I'm just playing no I'm not yes I am
I'm different I can't base what I'm gon' be off a what everybody isn't
They don't listen just whispering behind my back
No vision lack of ambition so wack

Chorus:
Jesus walk
Jesus walk with me
Jesus walk
Jesus walk with me
Jesus walk
And all my people that's drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money till it gets sky high
Jesus walk with me

And all my people that's living in poverty
One day you'll be opening your Bentley doors
Jesus walk with me
Jesus walk

So tight so fly
You got me lifted you got me lifted
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceilin'
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly


You know its leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doin' what we do watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl you keep it so fly with ya sweet hunnybuns
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes
Off top I can't lie
I love to get blowed
You my lil' suga I'm yo little chulo
And every time we kiss it's like a little whirlwind
You give me butterfly's in my stomach got me twisted
But still my homie and lover call you when I need ya
Just wanna meet ya hold ya mold ya just like pizza
Mold ya just like a sculpture ya the one I'm choosin'
Ain't playin no games back and forth like a tennis match
Gettin' lifted never coming down gettin' high off contact
It's like plane aim trains and automobiles
It's the way you throw it back I wanna know how you feel


So tight so fly
You got me lifted you got me lifted
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceilin'
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly

I remember when I was lost
Sittin' at home all alone
Can't get my mind to rest
I think I hit the phone
Pick it up to call my folks
Tell 'em that I'm caught up in this twister
So fine thick like Mississippi
But would you believe it
She got me off like corn liquor
Mixed with tropicana
I'm so excited I'm chillin' with my broad
Ice cream cookies and cake
A recipe of love got us hooked like a druggie
Gangsta booskie you know I'm loving your curves
From your stomach to your hips then you dip and do it again
I need a handful of them cookies
Got me and Sweeter than Ben & Jerry can 


So tight so fly
You got me lifted you got me lifted
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceilin'
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly



All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down


Man I promise she's so self-conscious
It's been a while since she's even thought of dressin'
Wildin' losin' her focus
Causin' a commotion cruisin' on autopilot
And can't nobody stop us
The roads you chose to go I'll follow
So now we crashin' in slow-motion
And we smashed up on the rocks still choosin' to hold on
Whoever thought that it would be this simple
Unfortunately for me I can't see the sequel
We makin' good ground but we could be freakin'
If you don't mind I'll just keep on speakin'


All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down


And when it falls down who you gon' call now
Come on come on and no need to be coy now
Just don't trip don't trip homie put your pride down
Don't you know that I'm just your angel
Think of all the negativity it the root could spawn
It's like Hmmm G5's to take me where I'm goin'
I'm goin' shawty I'm goin'
Where the hell am I goin'
I'm goin' head up down south
Somewhere tacky where you can catch me
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
Now my lil' cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now
I can't figure it out


All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down


And when it falls down who you gon' turn to
Who you gon' turn to Yeah I feel the love and the third
But why'd you have to do it
Why'd you have to grab the small amount of love left
Why'd you have to do it
Huh Huh Huh
And when it falls down who you gon' turn to
Who you gon' turn to
But did you know that when it snows my eyes become large
And the light that you shine can be seen
And when it falls down who you gon' turn to
Who you gon' turn to
Sunnier place and where love is
And when it falls down who you gon' turn to
Who you gon' turn to
But did you know that when it snows my eyes become large
And the light that you shine can be seen


All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
All falls down


I mean something that's from the soul you know
Something that people can feel
It's very important to me
I gotta make sure it's on point
You know
Why why would she be processed
Why why would she be processed
Why why would she be processed
Why why would she be processed
It's not original
It's not original
It's not original
It's not original
Baby can't you see
I'm calling
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm fallin'

There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby give me it
You're dangerous
I'm lovin' it

Too high
Can't come down
Losin' my head
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under

With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic

It's getting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil's cup
Slowly it's taking over me

Too high
Can't come down
It's in the air
And it's all around
Can you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under

With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic

Don't you know that you're toxic

Taste of your lips
Taste of your lips
Taste of your lips
Taste of your lips

With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under

With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
All lyrics of "Salt Shaker" by Ying Yang Twins featuring Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz:


Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean


Row like a 24
Let her know we want more
Ain't no tricks that's a hoe
Pulling up close like "Baby how you do-dat-der"
Put your legs straight up then I blaze that purr
I'ma ride I'ma skate and I'ma hop to it
Lickety split how a nigga wanna do it
Fuckin' with me 'cause of D-Roc then you thinking it's me y'all
Teaching you another motherfuckin' dance move ghetto dance


Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean


Mmm she got that dang Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Sliding grinding up the pole that's smoking
I bought you a drank telling you some slang
What's up with the thong you crept up in my brain
Hit the stage and snatch the bandanna
Out of my pocket I'm playing with your emotions
Darling stay time didn't permit
To gripe slowly knowing I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt with volumes and volumes of hoes
But I'm ready to tackle her body statue


Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean


Hey hey hey what's up
Tell me can you hear me I'm calling from the Sack
If you're an operator get the IRS on the phone
'Cause Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz looking for our Stimulate Package
We need cash so we can get crunk
Buy some dubs on twenty-two and four twelves in the trunk
Bounce that ass let me see you get live
Put your hands where my eyes can see straight up in the sky
Don't clown bitches


Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean


Lolly lolly lolly pop twerk twerk it don't stop
Pop pop pop that pussy move it round like a gypsy
Stop whoa back it up now let me see your hips
Swing all around the room now let me see your hips
Swang down to the floor now let me see your hips
Swang down to the ground now let me see your hips
Swing all around the room now let me see your hips
Swang


Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean
Fumbling his confidence
And wondering why the world has passed him by
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments
And failed attempts to fly fly

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
Dreaming about your goals again
Thinking about your goals again

I lay in my bed and I cry
Hopin' prayin' and waitin' for a reason
For a cure to this cancer I don't want to question

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
Somewhere we live inside
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than the wars of our fathers
And everything inside screams for second life yeah

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside

I am the reason that your favorite rapper is a chart topper
I'm an innovator I'm an undeniable force
I'm livin' proof success breeds from the choice

But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cursed out or coming up short

You'd need a golden calculator to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize that
Real guys go for real down-to-Mars girls yeah


I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer
See that roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Yeah roses really smell like poo-poo-oo

Your pussycat ain't running right the fluids low on gas
Quick to say no to a date but afraid to be alone
It's just your hormones kicking in and tempting you to bone
I'd rather see you graduate with honors
Like your mother I wish you good love and good will
And instead of a sweeter pill to make you high
Breathe deeper than the deepest dyyykeee smoking
When you're ready you'll see I'm shooting for stars
Hope you know you can always count on me daddy
There's thick hoes big girls skinny women
And then there's yo fat ass sister when will we meet again Whoo


I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer
See that roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Yeah roses really smell like poo-poo-oo


Now let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Had a drink about a hour ago
Sitting in a corner by herself in a bar in downtown Hell
She heard a noise and she looked through the door
And saw a man she nev--ever seen before
Light skin light blue eyes a double-chin and a plastic smile
Well her heart raced as he walked in the bar
And took a seat next to her at the counter
The bartender came over and told him that
"Sorry we don't serve Rose"
And the man said "That's okay I ain't got no money anyway"
Then he said "Let me tell you a story
About the mouse the red and the white
C'mon you know how it goes
Stayin' out late drinking
" I love you like a fat kid loves cake
Verse 1:
I'm rolling down a lonely highway
Asking God to please forgive me
For messing up the blessing he gave to me
I see everything clearer now
The nights as dark as they come
And I'm the type to never wanna hurt no one
Now I'm sittin' in the middle of nowhere
Thinking 'bout how I'm gonna get there
But I know yes I know I'll make it
Verse 2:
Said I've been on a minor road
I'm in the wrong direction I'm gone
Now I'm in the middle of nowhere
Trying to turn this thing around
Now I'm sitting in a smaller place
Where the only thing I see is your face
And I'm telling you yes I'm telling you
I'm coming back around
Chorus:
Cause I walked outta heaven
Cause I thought I knew better
Spendin' my time
In the darkest places
Oh Lord what I've become
Someone send me an angel
To bring me back to heaven
From where I belong
I won't cry no more
Verse 3:
Now I'm sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout all the things
I could've been with you
I know it was hard
Trying to deal with my ways
But somehow you knew
All the pain I been through
Tell me how did you know
Cause I'm still thinking
Walking around in circles
Know that it was worth it
To come back to you

Hit me
Can you keep up Baby boy
Make me lose my breath
Bring the noise make me scream
Hit me harder make me feel the heat
Love me till I ache
I know you're never gonna be the one to fake it
Because you know I like it rough baby
Don't be afraid to give me everything you got
And more


Lose my breath hit me hard
Make me lose my Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Lose my breath
Hit me hard make me lose my
Breath


Ooh I put it right there
Made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like you don't know what to do
After I done let you see the best of me
Turned around and gave you all of me
You ask for more and I give you more than enough
So what you worried about the way I cut
When I cut so deep that you feel like you're drowning
You know that's the way to make me


Lose my breath hit me hard
Make me lose my Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Lose my breath
Hit me hard make me lose my
Breath


Can you keep up
Baby don't mistake I don't want to hurt you
But I love to make you lose your breath
Hit me again harder


Lose my breath hit me hard
Make me lose my Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Lose my breath
Hit me hard make me lose my
Breath


Can you keep up
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Make me lose my breath

Verse 1:
I'm sending this one out
To all the lovers in the house
Cause everybody needs somebody
Or somethin' to love
When its cold outside
Who are you holding
You know damn well
Where your thoughts have been
You know you want to say
I'm yours I'm yours

Pre-Chorus:
Till the sun comes up
It's the same ole' thing
Same ole' thing
We can all do
Without the fame
And the glitter of the lights

Chorus:
Just hold me tight
And don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right
To lose control
Don't let go
I often tell myself
That we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon
It will all end

Verse 2:
I live in misery
When you're not around
And I won't be satisfied
Till we're taking those vows
There'll be some love making heartbreaking
Soul shaking love love making heartbreaking
Soul shaking

Pre-Chorus:
Till the sun comes up
It's the same ole' thing
Same ole' thing
We can all do
Without the fame
And the glitter of the lights

Chorus:
Just hold me tight
And don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right
To lose control
Don't let go
I often fantasize
The stars above are watching you
They know my heart
And speak to yours
Like only lovers do if only they could

Bridge:
I'd give the world
Anything to be
The one you need
And in your dreams baby
Let me be that fantasy

Chorus:
Just hold me tight
And don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right
To lose control
Don't let go

Outro:
Hold me my whole life
Squeeze me baby tight
Oh so tight show me
Show me what you feel
And I'll show you what I feel
What I feel inside

Yo this is Lil Flip
And this is the "Game Over" remix
And this is the way we put it down on lockdown
With the screwed up click you know what I'm sayin'
H-Town to N-Y-C we gon' get it
It's on baby


You see me on TV you know I'm a G
Say hi to the bad guy you see the ice in my ear
I'm living without fear when I push up my gear
I make G's disappear like I ain't got a care
I do it for the north south east west
DVDs I'm on the project steps
And Lil Flip the mixtape king
So I suggest you cop somethin' and bang in your deck
I'm a H-Town representative ridin' slab
And when I come down I'm poppin' my trunk bad
I'm worth a couple million dollars man it's too bad
I'mma' hold H-Town down that's on my dead gra'ndaddy's grave


Game over Flip Flip game over
Y'all thought it was a game but it's over over
Game over Flip Flip game over
Y'all thought it was a game but it's over over


Nigga understand when you see Lil Flip the mixtape king
Off in the cut it's a beautiful thing
And ain't no amount of rappers gonna do what I do
Especially when it come to freestyles off the dome do you
So now you need to go lil' flip
Who I be the freestyle king of the SUC
So when they see me come down and dip
I'm still runnin' the original freestyle shit
These niggas out here claimin' they the king of the block
But when you see Flip you betta bow down and stop
I'm throwin' up the peace sign in my car goin' 90
With the Double R lookin' tough in my Ferrari
Especially with the candy drippin' off of my paint
And when I pull up it'll be showin' dat taint
And Lil Flip don't give a damn about what you said
I'm pushin' elephant tusks up out of my head




Now as if we don't take requests
Let these motherf***ers know who they're messin' with
When you see me on your TV screen
Or in your magazine remember I'm a H-Town king
I don't really give a damn about the fame
But I gotta let these boys know they gotta show me some respect
You see we come from a different type of block
Where cats get thrown in trunks and never seen again
You can take a walk through the bricks and pine
You can ask them boys they'll tell ya Flip ain't lyin'
I'm in the club blowin' on that killa'
With my homies and my stiller' feel ya
I'm on top how does it feel yeah
I know these haters really wish that I was killed yeah




This is the "Game Over" remix
Lil Flip featuring the screwed up click
We puttin' it down like nobody else can
Believe that get that understand
North south east west coast we connectin'
New York Texas LA we respectin'
Killa C-Note ESG and Lil' Flip
And we out baby it's over
I can provide the uncensored lyrics of "One Thing" by Finger Eleven as requested:

Restless tonight
Cause I wasted the light
Between both these times
I drew a really thin line

It’s nothing I planned
And not that I can
But you should be mine
Across that line

If I traded it all
If I gave it all away for one thing
Just for one thing
If I sorted it out
If I knew all about this one thing
Wouldn’t that be something

I promise I might
Not walk on by
Maybe next time
But not this time

Even though I know
I don’t want to know
Yeah I guess I know
I just hate how it sounds

If I traded it all
If I gave it all away for one thing
Just for one thing
If I sorted it out
If I knew all about this one thing
Wouldn’t that be something

If I traded it all
If I gave it all away for one thing
Just for one thing
If I sorted it out
If I knew all about this one thing
Wouldn’t that be something

Even though I know
I don’t want to know
Yeah I guess I know
I just hate how it sounds

Even though I know
I don’t want to know
Yeah I guess I know
I just hate how it sounds

If I traded it all
If I gave it all away for one thing
Just for one thing
If I sorted it out
If I knew all about this one thing
Wouldn’t that be something

feat Master P


No Limit forever
Monic this your playa partner I ain't no hater so

Got my shades on with my J's on in the club with a pocket full of ones
This girl Jenny I've known her since back when we were ten oh yes
We were cool but that's a long time ago
I put her on got her a job haven't seen her since never saw it coming hmm
But it's all good I'm not worried
Things happen just like that


I should've known better
Than to think that it would work between us
I should've known better
Than to think that I was the only one only one
I should've known better
Than to think that you would fall in love
And trust me ultimately


Downtown Atlanta spotted Joe I said to myself "there he go"
With his new girl new car matching his clothes leaned over and said hello
He was surprised to see me like I was surprised to see him
He was like "Monica what you doing here" I said "Joe what’s up with them"
He said tryna make it happen with his new lady
And he had found out that we were still cool 'cause you know how he play me
But I didn't want to see I just wanted to leave and get out of this thing called love but I was wrong


I should've known better
Than to think that it would work between us
I should've known better
Than to think that I was the only one only one
I should've known better
Than to think that you would fall in love
And trust me finally


Telephone rings but nobody’s home so I tip on out leave the phones alone
There's no need to argue no need to shout we don't need to bring each other down
I know I was with it I know what's been going on
So let's just have a conversation maybe we can talk it on
Let's just get together maybe we can work it out
Maybe we can make it happen maybe we can turn it out


I should've known better
Than to think that it would work between us
I should've known better
Than to think that I was the only one only one
I should've known better
Than to think that you would fall in love
And trust me finally


But the truth about it is that I had to face
Cause when you lie to me it's like a bad mistake
And no matter what you'll always be my baby
Yes I loved you but I gotta let it go baby


I should've known better
Than to think that it would work between us
I should've known better
Than to think that I was the only one only one
I should've known better
Than to think that you would fall in love
And trust me finally


I should've known better
I should’ve known better
I should’ve known better
I should’ve known better
Verse 1:
Sick and tired of this world
There's no more air
Trippin' over myself
Goin' nowhere
Waiting
Suffocating
No direction
I took a dive
And on the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself

Chorus:
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell
Right through the cracks
And now I'm trying
To get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

Verse 2:
But I won't hesitate no more
No more
It cannot wait
I'm yours

Repeat Chorus
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes until I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish take a chance make a change and breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I'll take a risk take a chance make a change and breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane far away
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish take a chance make a change and breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change and breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on moving on
Fly away breakaway

Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change and breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish take a chance make a change and breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change and breakaway breakaway breakaway

Certainly here are the full uncensored lyrics to "100 Years" by Five for Fighting:

I'm 15 for a moment
Caught in between 10 and 20
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are

I'm 22 for a moment
She feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Making our way back from Mars

15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
15 there's never a wish better than this
When you only got 100 years to live

I'm 33 for a moment
Still the man but you see I'm of age
A kid on the way
A family on my mind

I'm 45 for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm heading into a crisis
Chasing the years of my life

15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose yourself
Within a morning star

15 I'm all right with you
15 there's never a wish better than this
When you only got 100 years to live

Half time goes by
Suddenly you’re wise
Another blink of an eye
67 is gone
The sun is getting high
We're moving on

I'm 99 for a moment
Dying for just another moment
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are

15 there's still time for you
22 I feel her too
33 you’re on your way
Every day's a new day

15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose
Hey 15 there's never a wish better than this
When you only got 100 years to live
Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

He said "I was in my early forties
With a lot of life before me
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the x-rays
Talking 'bout the options and talking 'bout sweet time"

I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man what'd you do 

And he said

"I went skydivin'
I went rocky mountain climbin'
I went 27 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said "Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'"

He said "I was finally the husband
That most of the time I wasn't
And all of a sudden goin' fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the Good Book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again" 

And then

I went skydivin'
I went rocky mountain climbin'
I went 27 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said "Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'"

Like tomorrow was a gift
And ya got eternity to think about
What'd ya do with it what did you do with it
What did I do with it
What would I do with it

Sky divin'
I went rocky mountain climbin'
I went 27 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flyin'"

And he said "Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'"
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Remember When" by Alan Jackson:

Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts made the start and it was hard
We lived and learned life threw curves
There was joy there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died
And new were born
And life was changed disassembled rearranged
We came together fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookin' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when

Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

Changing like the weather getting ready for the storm

Over and over again feeling restless hopeless and then
Feeling helpless and been to hell and then back
It’s only a minute until we get it

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "When the Sun Goes Down" by Kenny Chesney and Uncle Kracker:


Cause when the sun goes down we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down


Yeah we'll be having some fun
When the sun goes down
I can feel it now
When the sun sinks down
Over this sleepy town town


Out of sight in the moonlight
Damn right feels so right
Don't it feel like we can stop time


Cause when the sun goes down we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down


This day and age we're livin' in
Gives cause for apprehension ooh
With speed and new invention
And things like fourth dimension


Cause when the sun goes down we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down


All day long just takin' it easy
Layin' in a hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleepin' off the night before
Cause when the sun goes down we'll be back for more


Out of sight in the moonlight
Damn right feels so right
Don't it feel like we can stop time


Cause when the sun goes down we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down


When the sun goes down
We'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down
We'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
Verse 1:
You held my hand and walked me home I know
Why you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh
You wiped my tears got rid of all my fears
Why did you have to go
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust

Chorus:
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl
The one who who gives it all away ooh
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you
This time
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do
And cry

Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

Verse 2:
Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop thought I liked you a lot but I'm really upset
Get outta my head get off of my bed yeah that's what I said

Chorus:
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl
The one who who throws it all away ooh
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you
This time
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do
And cry

Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way
Better off that way

Bridge:
This guilt trip that you put me on won't

mess me up I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Chorus:
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you
This time
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do
And cry

Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

Chorus:
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl
The one who who gives it all away
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you
This time
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do
And cry

Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way
Don't think that your charm
And the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants
I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget
I'm gonna ask you to stop
Thought I liked you a lot
But I'm really upset
Get outta my head
Get off of my bed yeah that's what I said

Well I can provide the uncensored lyrics of "Redneck Woman" by Gretchen Wilson but please note that some of the language and content in the song may be considered offensive to some:

"Well I ain't never been the Barbie doll type
No I can't swig that sweet champagne I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern or in a honky-tonk or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip

'Cause I'm a redneck woman ain't no high-class broad
I'm just a product of my raising I say "hey y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me hell yeah

Victoria's Secret well their stuff's real nice
But I can buy the same damn thing on a Walmart shelf half-price
And still look sexy just as sexy as those models on TV
I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me
You might think I'm trashy a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door

'Cause I'm a redneck woman ain't no high-class broad
I'm just a product of my raising I say "hey y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me hell yeah

I'm redneck woman I ain't no high-class broad
I'm just a product of my raising I say "hey y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every old Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me hell yeah

Hell yeah"

Down down down
Okay guess who's back back back
Back again  'gain 'gain
Shady's back back back
Tell a friend friend friend


Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
All right stop pajama time
Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean wrap as in a new case
Of child-proofing rappers' mouths from closing in an attempt to try to
Keep it uh uh uh
From spilling out oh oh oh
I'ma be real blunt
And frank
I hope you crumble in your grape juice
You old flabby dusty-ass
Daddeh-daddeh Turn the music up turn me down
Gonna wake 'em all up


Now don't make me wake this baby come on
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying bitch nah
Why you always make me shout at you
Just lose it just lose it

Ha ha ha Oh oh
It's funny I remember back one year when daddy
Had no money yeah
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table
For you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you
So you could go to college -almost had a thousand dollars
'Till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat
One bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
But daddy had to work you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house just reminiscin'
Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow guess you pretty much are and Daddy's
Still here
Lainie I'm talkin' to you too
Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that
Yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it
Shh momma's only gone for the moment


Now don't make me wake this baby come on
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying bitch nah
Why you always make me shout at you
Just lose it just lose it

Oh
Okay boo now doot doot doot doot doot
Come on don't get me started let's go
You're listening to the sound of E Shady G-unit
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "I Go Back" by Kenny Chesney:

Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levvy
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty-yard line
A blanket a girl some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song I go back

I used to rock all night long to "Keep On Rockin' Me Baby"
Frat parties college bars just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on the Carolina shore
After graduation I drank a little more
Every time I hear that song I go back

I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song I go back

I go back I go back

To the feel of a fifty-yard line
A blanket a girl some raspberry wine
I go back
To watchin summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song I go back
I go back to the feel of a fifty-yard line
A blanket a girl some raspberry wine
I go back
To watchin summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song I go back
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright it's alright it's alright
My pressure on her hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Mmmmm

Oh yeah

Alright

Oh yeah


Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself


I don't wanna know
If you're playing me keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh baby I don't wanna know


Oh baby how'd you let let him hold you
How'd you let him touch you touch you
How'd you let him rock you rock you
How'd you let him rock you rock you



I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine


I don't wanna know
If you're playing me keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh baby I don't wanna know


Oh baby how'd you let let him hold you
How'd you let him touch you touch you
How'd you let him rock you rock you
How'd you let him rock you rock you



I said I don't wanna know don't wanna
I said I don't wanna know I don't
I said I don't wanna know don't wanna know
Don't wanna know oh


I don't wanna know
If you're playing me keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh baby I don't wanna know


Oh baby how'd you let let him hold you
How'd you let him touch you touch you
How'd you let him rock you rock you
How'd you let him rock you rock you


Oh yeah don't wanna know
And I don't wanna know don't wanna know
And oh how'd you let him rock you don't wanna know
And how'd you let him kiss your soul don't wanna know
And how'd you let him take your breath don't wanna know
And how'd you let him cause your death don't wanna know
And how'd you let him dominate you don't wanna know
And how'd you let him penetrate you don't wanna know
And how'd you let him complicate you don't wanna know
And how'd you let him masterate you don't wanna know

Don't wanna know don't wanna know
Said I don't wanna know I don't wanna

I'll do my best to comply with your request Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Letters from Home" by John Michael Montgomery:

My dearest son it's almost June  
I hope this letter catches up with you  
And finds you well  
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain  
And everything's the same ol' same in Johnsonville  

Your stubborn old daddy ain't said too much  
But I'm sure you know he sends his love  
And she goes on  
In a letter from home  

I hold it up and show my buddies  
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy  
And they all laugh  
Like there's something funny bout the way I talk  
When I say "Mamma sends her best ya'll"  

I fold it up and put it in my shirt  
Pick up my gun and get back to work  
And it keeps me drivin' on  
Waitin' on letters from home  

My dearest love it's almost dawn  
I've been lying here all night long  
Wondering where you might be  
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring  
Man on the television said something  
So I couldn't sleep  

But I'll be alright I'm just missin' you  
And this is me kissin' you  
X's and O's  
In a letter from home  

I hold it up and show my buddies  
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy  
And they all laugh  
'Cause she calls me "Honey"  
But they take it hard 'cause I ain't there  
And they all wonder how we do it  
And they all say it's a shame  
'Cause I'm missin' ev'rything  
Waitin' on letters from home  

I fold it up and put it in my shirt  
Pick up my gun and get back to work  
And it keeps me drivin' on  
Waitin' on letters from home  

solo  

Dear son I know I ain't written  
Sittin' here tonight alone I missin' you  
And all the things that we've been through  

I put a picture in this letter  
Of all of us together  
I'm the one wearing the smile  
Standing in the kitchen  
It was taken at your sister's wedding  
Man time flies  

But I'll be up there again  
'Cause you'll be talking to me then  
Asking me where I've been  
And all the time we've wasted  

Laughing at the silly things  
We're repeating all the memories  
And I'm looking forward to the day  
When I'm coming home to stay  

Spoken  
I'm proud of you  
Y'all take care of each other  
I love you  

In a letter from home
He was standing in the rubble
Of an old farmhouse outside Birmingham
When some on the scene reporter
Stuck a camera in the face of that old man
He said "tell the folks please mister
What are you gonna do
Now your houses gone and your crops have all been ruined"

He said "I'm gonna sit right here
And watch this river rise
I'm gonna close my eyes and listen to
The thunderous applause
Of a million dreams coming true
'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you"

White turnin' into black and white
And the smoke is too thick to breath
And if you're coming home you're coming home tonight
But you gotta promise me one thing
"Hey old man tell me what you wanna do
Now that you got nothing tell me what'll you do"

He said "I'm gonna sit right here
And watch this river ride
I'm gonna close my eyes and listen to
The thunderous applause
Of a million dreams coming true
'Cause I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you"

I'm gonna sit right here
And watch this river ride
'Cause it's all about you and me
And the moment
We're alive

And I'm gonna sit right here
And watch the river ride
And drink a beer and listen to
The engine fly by in the summertime
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
feat Frankee

Whoa whoa whoa

Oops I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game oh baby
Oops you think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby baby

Oops I did it again
I played with your heart got lost in the game
Oh baby baby
Oops you think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Now I've watched all their changes
And I loved them so
I'm a player in this game
People can't you see
I'm the one they call the Queen of the scene

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Baby oh

Oops I did it again
I played with your heart got lost in the game
Oh baby baby
Oops you think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops I did it again
I played with your heart got lost in the game
Oh baby baby
Oops you think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

I've been waiting all day for ya babe
So won't cha come and sit and talk to me
And tell me how we're gonna be together always
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I Hold on to my pillow tight
And think of how you promised me forever


I never thought that anyone could make me feel this way
Now that you're here boy all I want is just a chance to say


Get out
Right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late now
And I can't wait for you to be gone
'Cause I know about her who
And I wonder who
How I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you were just a waste of time waste of time


Tell me why you're looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold
To go behind my back and call my friend


Boy you must have gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone
So now after all is said and done
Maybe I'm the one to blame but


To think that you could be the one
Well it didn't work out that way
I guess things don't always turn out the way you hoped


Boy you told me con con contradiction
You're inconsistent
Your actions contradict your words
So now go pack your bags spin out the door
Got a new man already and ya just don't know


Get out
Right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late now
And I can't wait for you to be gone
'Cause I know about her who
And I wonder who
How I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you were just a waste of time waste of time
Verse 1:
I think I'm in love with you
Caught you staring at me and there's nothing else to do
I want to get closer to you somehow
I wish you felt like I do right now

Pre-Chorus:
I want to know
Every little thing about you
I don't care
About your other girls
Just give me one chance
To show you how
Appreciative this girl
Can be

Chorus:
Cause I'm so in love with you
Can't help but breath in your scent
Ohh I'm so in love with you
I don't think you even comprehend
Just how much I want you

Verse 2:
I see you in the halls everyday
All of your other girls seem so cliche
I try to fight it I really do
But every time I see you I'm back to loving you

Pre-Chorus:
And I want to know
Every little thing about you
I don't care
About your other girls
Just give me one chance
To show you how
Appreciative this girl
Can be

Chorus:
Cause I'm so in love with you
Can't help but breath in your scent
Ohh I'm so in love with you
I don't think you even comprehend
Just how much I want you

Bridge:
Sometimes I feel like screaming
Going crazy at the thought of you leaving
My mind is like a hurricane
Without you here my life's just pain

Chorus:
Cause I'm so in love with you
Can't help but breath in your scent
Ohh I'm so in love with you
I don't think you even comprehend
Just how much I want you

Outro:
Cause baby to me
You're the only one I see
Every day every night
I want to be with you tonight

Ladies and gentlemen you are witnessing history
With the first R&B song and rapper collaboration


Now tell me do it make you hot when I creep in your room
Girl I'll take off all my clothes and let you look at my moon
I know you like it when I eat it
And I love it when you lose control and scream while I'm in it
And I can't wait for your parents to go out of town
Cause I know when they leave you'll come runnin' down
Holdin' your nightgown whispering "Daddy's not home"
I'm that superman come take your hand and show you a thug can
Be passionate and gentle sentimental and mental
I'll lay you down slow and go hard with no clothes
Or if you want it in the shower let it go
Hey girl listen to the sound of my voice
I got somethin' for your mind your body and your soul
It's Cassidy the problem and I'm ready to roll

And we'll share each other's secrets and we'll talk about tomorrow

And the next thing you know it's gon' be some slow melodic romantic shit
I'm kissin' your toes and grabbin' your hips
And that's juss the start of it
And when I'm done you won't even wanna part from it
And I'm just sparkin' it
I got you moanin' and groanin'
Keep comin' and goin' and comin' again like you're growin'
Got you sayin' my name more than once like Marylin Manson

And when I'm done I'll have you singin' like Donna like 
Oh baby baby

Now let me see you do the Love Slide
I will provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "American Soldier" by Toby Keith:

I'm just trying to be a father
Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone

Up and at 'em bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
Yeah I'm dressed up for success
From my head down to my boots

I don't do it for the money
There are bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory
I just do it anyway

Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah I'm real good under pressure
Being all that I can be

And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekends been too strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long

You can bet that I stand ready
When the wolf growls at the door
Hey I'm solid hey I'm steady
Hey I'm true down to the core

And I will always do my duty
No matter what the price
I've counted up the cost
I know the sacrifice

Oh and I don't want to die for you
But if dyin's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
'Cause freedom don't come free

I'm an American soldier an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines
So you can sleep in peace tonight

American soldier I'm an American soldier
Yeah an American soldier an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines
So you can sleep in peace tonight

I'm an American soldier an American
An American soldier an American soldier

I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show because
These chicks don't even know the name of my band 
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band


So I get offstage right drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup ladies My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"
They're all like "'Oh my God it's him
Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock
Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin' all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
What you don't like her Nah I mean okay
The chick is all right but I'm just fuckin' her 'cause she looks like
These chicks don't even know the name of my band 
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band


My band my band
My band my band
My band my band
My band my band


Now why is this chick all on my side
Talkin' 'bout her girlfriend's better but that's her opinion
I buy dinners she push me in the friendzone
But I ain't even trippin' I'mma just take her friend home
Meet Sabrina nice to meet ya go ahead and kiss the baby
And here's my number you can hit me if you need a fix of Slim Shady
'Cause I'm on fire like a campfire
I'm on point like a sniper I got a VS on my neck and on my eyelids
And my nuts keep tellin' me to get this chick she's a tad thick
So I'm leavin' with armadillos in the hood
With bullets stuck in their heads
Put my tape on and I'm cooped up in my room
Screamin' the lyrics "This shit's wicked awesome"
Then my mom walks in "What the fuck is this garbage Wanna get your ass kicked by a kid named Chris Wallace"
And don't believe the garbage this is not a massage
And that's the reason that our shows are psychotic

My band my band
My band my band
My band my band
My band my band


I'm the lead singer of my band I get all the girl's to take off their underpants
And the lead guitarist I play the hard parts
Everybody goes "Oh yeah that's the tightest"
I'm the one who's always choking chicks to slam
I'm the one who's using who in our crazy eight van
We're all dudes we're just friends
What are you saying man You're not my homie
My homie

My band my band
My band my band
My band my band
My band my band


These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band yeah
My band my band
My band my band
