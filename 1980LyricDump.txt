Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Magic" by Olivia Newton-John:

Come take my hand you should know me  
I've always been in your mind  
You know that I'll be kind  
I'll be guiding you  
Building your dream has to start now  
There's no other road to take  
You won't make a mistake  
I'll be guiding you  

From where I stand you are home free  
The planets align so rare  
There's promise in the air  
And I'm guiding you  
Through every turn I'll be near you  
I'll come anytime you call  
I'll catch you when you fall  
I'll be guiding you  

You have to believe we are magic  
Nothin' can stand in our way  
You have to believe we are magic  
Don't let your aim ever stray  
And if all your hopes survive  
Your destiny will arrive  
I'll bring all your dreams alive  
For you

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Funkytown" by Lipps Inc:

Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
Town to keep me movin' keep me groovin' with some energy
Well I talk about it talk about it
Talk about it talk about it
Talk about talk about
Talk about movin'
Gotta move on

Gotta move on

Won't you take me to Funkytown
Won't you take me to Funkytown
Won't you take me to Funkytown
Won't you take me to Funkytown

Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
Town to keep me movin' keep me groovin' with some energy

What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing
Can't you tell that your tie's too white
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin' out lately honey
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny but it's still rock and roll to me


What's the matter with the car I'm driving
"Can't you tell that it's out of style"
Should I get a set of white wall tires
"Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile
 Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental"
Hot funk cool punk even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me


Oh it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants
Well you could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers


Next phase new wave dance craze anyways
It's still rock and roll to me



What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing
"Don't you know that they're out of touch"
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student
"If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion honey
All you need are looks and a whole lot of money
It's the next phase new wave dance craze anyways
It's still rock and roll to me


Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny but it's still rock and roll to me
Some say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed
That with the sun's love in the spring
Becomes the rose
I was tired of my lady we'd been together too long
Like a worn-out recording of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns there was this letter I read

"If you like Piña Coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for write to me and escape"

I didn't think about my lady I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet I thought it wasn't half bad

"Yes I like Piña Coladas and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape"

So I waited with high hopes then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady and she said "Oh it's you"
Then we laughed for a moment and I said "I never knew" 

"That you liked Piña Coladas and getting caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne
If you'd like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for come with me and escape"

"If you like Piña Coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for come with me and escape"
Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Cars" by Gary Numan:

Here in my car
I feel safest of all
I can lock all my doors
It's the only way to live
In cars

Here in my car
I can only receive
I can listen to you
It keeps me stable for days
In cars

Here in my car
Where the image breaks down
Will you visit me please
If I open my door
In cars

Here in my car
I know I've started to think
About leaving tonight
Although nothing seems right
In cars

Doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo

I'll keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside

Yeah I'm working my way back to you babe
And the happiness that died

I let it get away
Been paying every day

When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free

Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
But how I cried over losing you

See me down each night this what I say
"I'm gonna find her gonna bring her back someday"

With a burning love inside

Yeah I'm working my way back to you babe
And the happiness that died
I'll keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside

And the happiness that died

I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside

But if I'd been a man in reality
You'd still be here babe loving me

Now my nights are long and lonely
And I ain't too strong babe I just miss you only

My love my love ba-a-by
I'll keep pushing on ba-a-by
Till I can get my ba-a-by
My sweet sweet lovin' back again

I'll keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside

And the happiness that died ba-a-by

I'll keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside

And the happiness that died

Forgive me girl

Tell me girl oh I've said too much there's nothing more I can say
But all I really want to do girl

And I want you to be my acrobat I want you to be my lover
Oh there was no other one who could take you away no

Little Jeannie she got so much time little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years you still retain the fears of youth

You're only seventeen but you're my teenage queen
You know what I mean do ya Oh oh aaah

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep

I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again


I was born
The son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind
With a gun in my hand

Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind
Accused and tried

For a crime that was a lie
Fought many men
To keep my love alive

I searched for justice
And found revenge
Gonna ride like the wind
And never look back again


Well I'm riding like the wind
Yeah I'm leaving all my troubles behind
I'm riding like the wind
Yes I'm leaving all my troubles behind


Ride like the wind
I'll be taking my chances
Ride like the wind
I'm gonna be somebody
Ride like the wind
I'm gonna see it through
Ride like the wind
To be free again


And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
Am I dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame

I believe it's meant to be darling
I watch when you are sleeping you belong with me
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame

Say my name sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely and then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling oh

Say my name and every color illuminates
We are shining and we will never be afraid again
Say my name as every color illuminates

Say my name again and I'll be there I'll be there
You can rely on me I will never let you down
I will always be around oh

Say my name sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely and then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling

Say my name and every color illuminates
We are shining and we will never be afraid again
Say my name as every color illuminates

We will never be afraid again oh

We will never be afraid again oh
We will never be afraid again oh

Say my name sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely and then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling

Say my name and every color illuminates
We are shining and we will never be afraid again
Say my name as every color illuminates

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Biggest Part of Me" by Ambrosia:

I've been fooled before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door
How about some information please

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh

Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh

Are you just havin' fun

Time's standing still
Waiting for some small clue
I keep getting chills
When I think your love is true

I've been talked about baby
Something you should know

It's gonna take a miracle to make me let go
And if you see me with another man
Laughin' and dancin' and holdin' hands

Well you better understand I'm in love with
Another man

And what he couldn't give me
Whoa whoa whoa
Was the one little thing that you can
Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh

Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh

Are you just havin' fun

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
This is pure and simple
And you should realize

That it's comin' from your heart
And not your head

I love you
I honestly love you
The more I learn the more I learn
The more I learn the less I know
About love about love

All I know is that I love you
That I love you
That I love you
That I love you

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh

Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh

Are you just havin' fun

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "This Is It" by Kenny Loggins:

There've been times in my life
I've been wonderin' why
Still somehow I believed we'd always survive
Now I'm not so sure you're waiting here
One good reason to try
But what more can I say
What's left to provide
You think that maybe it's over
Only if you want it to be
Are you gonna wait for a sign
Your miracle
Stand up and fight
This is it
Make no mistake where you are
This is it
You back's to the corner
This is it
Don't be a fool anymore
This is it
The waiting is over
No room to run
No way to hide
No time for wondering why
It's here
The moment is now
About to decide
Let him believe
Or leave him behind
But keep me near in your heart
And know whatever you do
I'm here by your side
You said that maybe it's over
Not if you don't want it to be
For once in your life here's your miracle
Stand up and fight
This is it
Make no mistake where you are
This is it
You're goin' no further
This is it
Until it's over and done
No one can tell you what you know
Who makes the choice of how it goes
It's not up to me this time
You know
There comes a time in everyone's life
When they must decide
About the secret they've been keeping inside
Whether to walk away or stand up beside
So this is it
Make no mistake where you are
This is it
You're back's to the corner
This is it
Don't be a fool anymore
This is it
The waiting is over
This is it
Make no mistake where you are
This is it
You're goin' no further
This is it
Until it's over and done
This is it
One way or another
This is it
No one can tell you what you know
This is it
You make the choice of how it goes
This is it
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me for me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now I don't mean to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix so

Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me for me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now Cupid if your arrow makes her love strong for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know that tween the two of us her heart we can steal
Help me if you will so

Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me for me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Cupid don't you hear me
Calling you
I need you Cupid
Help me Cupid

You got the look of a lonely lonely man

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and then make everything all right
I've seen that look in your eyes

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll take you for a ride
Just when you think you've learned to trust him
You're left on your own he's gone
You're a lover and a woman and a friend and a mother
You're everything that I need
But I've learned to be cautious
And I've learned to believe

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and then make everything all right
I've seen that look in your eyes

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll take you for a ride
Just when you think you've learned to trust him
You're left on your own he's gone

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Sailing
Well it's not far down to paradise at least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away and find tranquility
Oh the canvas can do miracles just you wait and see
Believe me
It's not far to never-never land no reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy of innocence again
Oh the canvas can do miracles just you wait and see
Believe me
Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free
Fantasy it gets the best of me when I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me
Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free
Well it's not far back to sanity at least it's not for me
And when the wind is right you can sail away and find serenity
Oh the canvas can do miracles just you wait and see
Believe me
Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free
The smile you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
We found you lying on the floor
And we picked you up and gave you hope
Now I am sure that you'll be no more
My heart is beating more and more
You showed me how to love you
I've been loving you more and more
And you know I love you dearly
Yes it's true I love you even more
So let's hold on to each other
For a little bit longer
For a little bit longer
For a little bit longer
Just do it do it Do it ya'all
Do it right Do it do it
Do it right Do it do it
Do it right Do it do it
Do it right Do it do it
Do it tonight

You need a lover someone to take over
Oh baby don't look any further
Tonight is your night for a true love affair
Woah darling don't you know
That will only take you so far
Take your time do it right
You can do it baby do it tonight
Make it last forever and ever

Take your time do it right

Make it last forever and ever

It's raining it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears
After all these years
No sunshine no moonlight
No stardust no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance
I always dreamed I'd find the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love our love
Raining raining
Pouring pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear
If you had enough don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
If you had enough don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it don't you do it
It's time to groove on time to get down
All you need is a lover that won't drive you down
Don't you feel it growing day by day
People getting ready for the news
Some are happy some are sad
Gonna let the music play
What the people need is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
You gotta get a message get it on through
Oh now mama's go'n' to after 'while
Now mama's go'n' to after 'while

You you're such a special lady
I bet you been a wonder all your life
Ooh girl ain't it crazy

Every time you're near my heart takes flight

You're my special lady

In this world of heartache
I need someone who would
Just put their arms around me
And love me tenderly
With a love that will shelter me
And keep me warm and tight
I want to know that I am safe
When I lay down at night

Chorus:
Send one your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart
Show him that you care
About him
Really care
Wanna share
Wanna share
Your love
Share your love
With your heart and soul

Verse 2:
If you find the one you love
Treat him tenderly
Like a queen and a king
For the love you give will reign
For eternity
There's nothing more precious
Than the time we spend together
I'll treasure every moment
With heartfelt love and pleasure

Chorus

Bridge:
One rose that blooms in May
Captures me every time
I pray that you'll be mine
I shall give you love
And devotion
Long as I live

Chorus x2
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Second Time Around" by Shalamar:

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

The second time around
I know you're mine
The second time around

You're feeling like
You never felt before
The second time around
Somebody loves you
You're gonna break
Their heart again
Why can't they see
You're still a part of me
You're still the only one
That sets me free

I know that you're using me
To ease your mind
And I know you
Don't love me the same way

The second time around
I know you're mine
The second time around

And though
Love is really blind
I know I've got to try
The second time around

Girl you're gorgeous and
You know you've got it
But loving you baby
I'm getting tired
My friends all say
That you're too young for me
But they don't know
What's in your heart
They see you all over town
Just making your rounds

I know that you're using me
To ease your mind
And I know you
Don't love me the same way

The second time around
I know you're mine
The second time around

And though
Love is really blind
I know I've got to try
The second time around

The second time around yeah
The second time around yeah
The second time around yeah

Repeat and fade
Verse 1:
Used to think that life was sweet
Used to think we were so complete
I can't believe you'd throw it away
Used to feel we had it made
Used to feel we could sail away
Can you imagine how I feel today

Chorus:
Well it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore

Verse 2:
It used to be so easy now it's hard
To keep the faith but you know love can't be
Undone
Watchin' love fade away
Cuttin' back on I love you everyday
How could you lose that lovin' feeling oh

Chorus:
Well it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore

Bridge:
Well it seems a long time
Since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right

Chorus:
Well it sеems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore

Outro:
Well it's so funny how we don't talk
Anymore
Verse 1:
Well folks here's a story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a low-down hoochie-coocher
She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

Chorus:
Hidey hidey hidey hi Hidey hi
Hodey hodey hodey ho Hodey ho
Heedey heedey heedey hee Heedey hee
Hodey hodey hodey ho Hodey ho
Stomp your feet if you've got a beat
And everybody's gonna move their feet

Verse 2:
Well Minnie had a dream 'bout a kingfisher
She dreamed he was swimming in a big gold fisher
And as he swam he said with a wink
"I'm goin' to heaven in a hollow log clink"

Chorus

Verse 3:
Well Minnie took the hint and headed for the ditch
She started paddling like a son-of-a-bi-
She shouted "Help help save poor me"
That's the end of my story as you can see

Chorus

Repeat chorus and fade out
Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do

Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know

Lord I know

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

This night is gonna last forever
Last all last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know

Lord I know

Searchin'
Eyes meet hearts pound
Somethin'
Racin' racin' the rounds
Somethin'
Wild willin' woman
She's wantin'
Danger
The last dance sequins shine
Somethin'
Spent the night romancin'
It's a
Hundred in the shade
Hot night
Dodgin' door-to-door
Keep cool
But there's nowhere to hide
No no
Verse 1:
I'm so tired of toein' the line
I'm so tired of playin' the fool
When I'm a man who needs to be told
That his heart is just too cruel

Chorus:
And every time I try to change
I always end up playin' the game
Of toein' the line toein' the line

Verse 2:
I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello until that first smile
But if I had to do it all over again
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause this love is real

Chorus:
And every time I try to change
I always end up playin' the game
Of toein' the line toein' the line

Bridge:
So let's take a gamble and roll the dice
Let's do it all let's do it twice
Chorus:
And every time I try to change
I always end up playin' the game
Of toein' the line toein' the line
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Better Love Next Time" by Dr Hook:

Lady when you're with me I'm smiling
Give me all your love
Your hands build me up when I'm sinking
Touch me and my troubles all fade
Lady from the moment I saw you
Standing all alone
You gave all the love that I needed
So shy like a child who had grown

You're my lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling clear and lovely
You're my lady

Lady turns me on when I'm lonely
Give me all your charm
Evenings when you lay down beside me
Take me gently into your arms
You're my lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling clear and lovely
You're my lady

Lady I'm your knight in shining armor
And I love you
You have made me what I am and
I am yours
My love there's so many ways
I want to say I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You're my lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling clear and lovely
You're my lady

Lady of the morning
Love shines in your eyes
Sparkling clear and lovely
You're my lady
Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics of "Him" by Rupert Holmes:

Him has been referred to as "Song Number One"


He was everything she wanted he was everything she needed
He was everything she dreamed of he was everything she believed in
He was everything that made her feel alive made her feel
He was everything she wanted all wrapped up in a surprise

He was fresh he was exciting he was a breath of fresh air
He was intelligent he was amazing and no one could compare
She waited patiently for him but suddenly he appeared appeared
Suddenly he was near and that's when she got this much feared


HIM HIM HIM
That's when she yelled out
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she started to shout
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she knew she was losing her heart
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she fell apart


She wanted to get to know him and she wanted to show him
She wanted him to notice her she wanted him to be her lover
But it wasn't easy for her so she tried to ignore him ignore him
She tried to pretend that she didn't like him but she couldn't avoid him

He was different than the others he was always in control
He was the kind of man that made her feel like she was on a roll
She had to tell him how she felt but that wasn't easy easy
So she decided to just relax and just be breezy


HIM HIM HIM
That's when she yelled out
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she started to shout
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she knew she was losing her heart
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she fell apart


She needed him she wanted him
She had to have him and that was just the start
She begged him she pleaded with him
She said "I need you that's when he stole her heart"


HIM HIM HIM
That's when she yelled out
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she started to shout
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she knew she was losing her heart
HIM HIM HIM
That's when she fell apart


HIM HIM HIM

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "On the Radio" by Donna Summer:

Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant

Whoa I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling about you
But they said it really loud they said it on the air

On the radio oh-oh-oh-on the radio
Oh-oh-oh-on the radio oh-oh-oh
On the radio oh-oh-oh-on the radio
Oh-oh-oh-now now

Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be coming home real soon

Whoa yeah
And they said it really loud they said it on the air
On the radio oh-oh-oh-on the radio
Oh-oh-oh-on the radio oh-oh-oh
On the radio oh-oh-oh-on the radio
Oh-oh-oh-on the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud they said it really loud
On the radio oh-oh-oh-on the radio
Oh-oh-oh-on the radio oh-oh-oh
On the radio oh-oh-oh-on the radio
Oh-oh-oh

On the radio on the radio
On the radio on the radio
There's no label on the bottle
In the bathroom
And I'm trying to forget
All about you
Oh I'm lookin' for
Some affirmation
But you keep givin' me
Nooothing
But headache
Heartache all I get is
Frustration
Daylight I'm so absent-minded
Nighttime it's always the same
I'm on the run I need some
Soo-o-o-o-oul
I'm on the hunt I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the
Waiter Dinner at the Ritz
Nooooobody's perfect
This ain't no social crisis
This ain't no socialite
This is you having fun
And I'm gonna get some
When the night comes falling
Down on me
And I'm feeling
Emotional Rescue
Emotional Rescue
Emotional Rescue
Nothing left to save
Emotional Rescue
Emotional Rescue
Emotional Rescue
All that I need to dull the pain




I wanna fly close to the sun
I wanna know how high I can go
I wanna feel it burn in my chest
I wanna know what I already know


Rise rise
To the place where eagle's fly
Rise rise
To the place where eagle's fly


I wanna sink deep in your sea
I wanna know what I can't see
I wanna feel your fire all around
I wanna know what I already know


Rise rise
To the place where eagle's fly
Rise rise
To the place where eagle's fly





Rise rise
To the place where eagle's fly
Rise rise
To the place where eagle's fly


Rise rise
To the place where eagle's fly
Rise rise
To the place where eagle's fly
Verse 1:  
If there's one thing in my life that's missing  
It's the time that I spend alone  
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water  
Lots of those friendly people  
And they're showing me ways to go  
And I never want to lose their inspiration  

Chorus:  
Time for a cool change  
I know that it's time for a cool change  
Now that my life is so prearranged  
I know that it's time for a cool change  

Verse 2:  
Well I was born in the sign of water  
And it's there that I feel my best  
The albatross and the whales  
They are my brothers  
It's kind of a special feeling  
When you're out on the sea alone  
Staring at the full moon like a lover  

Chorus:  
Time for a cool change  
I know that it's time for a cool change  
Now that my life is so prearranged  
I know that it's time for a cool change  

Verse 3:  
I've never been romantic  
And sometimes I don't care  
I know it may sound selfish  
But let me breathe the air  
Yeah yeah yeah  

Chorus:  
Time for a cool change  
I know that it's time for a cool change  
Now that my life is so prearranged  
I know that it's time for a cool change  

Repeat Chorus until fade
When you're feeling kinda lonely and your blues have got you down
Call me up on the phone I'll come 'round
When your love affair is over said it all and done
And you're feelin' like a fool having no fun

Don't you worry don't you worry no
'Cause you're not the only one
Who's standin' there with no one there
When love has come and gone

You're only lonely ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're only lonely ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're only lonely ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
When love's already been and gone

You're only lonely ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

When love's already been and gone

When you need somebody to be with you in the night
When you need somebody to hold you tight
Don't you worry it'll be alright
I'm only lonely too tonight

You're only lonely ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're only lonely ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're only lonely ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

When people keep repeating  
That you'll never fall in love  
When everybody keeps retreating  
But you can't seem to get enough  
Let my love open the door  
Let my love open the door  
Let my love open the door  
To your heart  

When everything feels all over  
Everybody seems unkind  
I'll give you a four-leaf clover  
Take all worry out of your mind  
Let my love open the door  
Let my love open the door  
Let my love open the door  
To your heart to your heart  

I have the only key to your heart  
I can stop you falling apart  
Try today you'll find this way  
Come on and give me a chance to say  
Let my love open the door  
It's all I'm living for  
Release yourself from misery  
Only one thing's gonna set you free  
That's my love  

Let my love open the door  
Let my love open the door  
Let my love open the door  
To your heart to your heart  

When tragedy befalls you  
Don't let them bring you down  
Love can cure your problems  
You're so luck I'm around  
Let my love open the door  
Let my love open the door  
Let my love open the door  
To your heart to your heart  

I have the only key to your heart

To your heart to your heart to your heart to your heart to your heart to your heart
Just like Romeo I found my Juliette
And with her soft cheek I ain't savin’ my breath
But she'll turn her back she'll take up with those
Who slept through all of the days before us
Big-time losers how do you do's
They're ashamed 'cause they ain't like me and you

And I'm just tryin' to tell you
What I'm goin' through
Tryin' to keep it all inside
And not fall apart with you
And I'm losin' and I'm turnin'
And I'm dizzied in the light
I'll find my way and I'll move on
And I'll be all right

But you know I may be gone
By then it's all right
And you know that I'll be dancin'
Just as fast as I can
But if you want to stay a while
Then I'll be your man oh yeah

And I'm tryin' just to tell you
What I'm goin' through
Tryin' to keep it all inside
And not fall apart with you
I'm losin' and I'm turnin'
And I'm dizzied in the light
I'll find my way and I'll move on
And I'll be all right

But you know I may be gone
By then it's all right
But you know that I'll be dancin'
Just as fast as I can
But if you want to stay a while
Then I'll be your man oh yeah

And I'm tryin' just to tell you
What I'm goin' through
Tryin' to keep it all inside
And not fall apart with you
And I'm losin' and I'm turnin'
And I'm dizzied in the light
I'll find my way and I'll move on
And I'll be all right

But you know I may be gone
By then it's all right
And you know that I'll be dancin'
Just as fast as I can
But if you want to stay a while
Then I'll be your man oh yeah
Oh I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six-o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shaving razor's cold and it stings

Cheer up sleepy Jean oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen

You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh and our good time starts and ends
Without dollar one to spend
But how much baby do we really need

Cheer up sleepy Jean oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen

Cheer up sleepy Jean oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen

Cheer up sleepy Jean oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen

Cheer up sleepy Jean oh what can it mean
To a daydream believer and a homecoming queen
Look at us baby up all night tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who lived through years in the dark

Ah yeah every time I try to walk away something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why when we get crazy it just ain't to right try to keep you head little girl girl

Friend of mine he said we're headed for a fall
But it might be kinda fun
I thought no no this is no time for dancing
And someday these dreams will be real
And they'll be paid for with tears
And I can't tell you why
No baby / I can't tell you why / I can't tell you why

Every time I try to walk away
There's something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why no no baby I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Baby look at me and tell me what you see
You ain't seen the best of me yet
Give me time I'll make you forget the rest
I got more in me and you can set it free
I can catch the moon in my hand
Don't you know who I am
Remember my name fame
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly high
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame fame
I'm gonna live forever
Baby remember my name
Remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember remember
Baby hold me tight 'cause you can make it right
You can shoot me straight to the top
Give me love and take all I've got to give
Baby I'll be tough too much is not enough no

Ooh I got what it takes
Remember my name fame

Who's goin' to ride that chrome three wheeler  
Who's goin' to make that first mistake  
Who wants to wear those gypsy leather  
All the way to Fire Lake  

Who wants to break the news about Uncle Joe  
You remember Uncle Joe  
He was the one afraid to cut the cake  
Who wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah  
Joe's run off to Fire Lake  

Joe's run off to Fire Lake  
Joe's run off to Fire Lake  
Who wants to brave those bronze beauties  
Lying in the sun  
With their long soft hair falling  
Flying as they run  

Oh they smile so shy  
And they flirt so well  
And they lay you down so fast  
Till you look straight up and say  
"Oh lord am I really here at last"  

Who wants to play those eights and aces  
Who wants a raise  
Who needs a stake  
Who wants to take that long shot gamble  
And head out to Fire Lake  

Head out  
Who wants to go to Fire Lake  
And head out  
Who wants to go to Fire Lake  

Who's goin' to do it  
And who's goin' to get it done  
And who's goin' to do it  

Who wants to wear those gypsy leathers  
All the way to Fire Lake  
Who wants to break the news about Uncle Joe  
You remember Uncle Joe  
He was the one afraid to cut the cake  
Who wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah  
Joe's run off to Fire Lake  

Joe's run off to Fire Lake  
Joe's run off to Fire Lake  
Who wants to go to Fire Lake  
And head out  
Who wants to go to Fire Lake  
And head out  
Who wants to go to Fire Lake  
And head out  
Who wants to go to Fire Lake  
And head out
I'd be happy to provide the uncensored lyrics to "How Do I Make You" by Linda Ronstadt:

I want to know
What I'm doing wrong
What I'm doing wrong
I want to know
What I'm doing so wrong
With a love that's so strong

And so real that it can't be ignored
Ooh I know I know I know I know I know that you
You say you want you want you want you want me
But how do I make you want me
How do I make you love me like you say you do

I gave you everything that I had
Everything I had
I don't know
I don't know what to do to make you love me
Like you say you do oh baby

I'm trying to be kind
Trying to be good
Trying to be everything
That you said that you would
But how do I make you want me
How do I make you love me like you say you do

I gave you everything that I had
Everything I had
I don't know
I don't know what to do to make you love me
Like you say you do oh baby

How do I make you want me
How do I make you love me
Love me love me love me love me
Like you say you do
Like you say you do
Like you say you do
She's just 16 years old
Leave her alone they say
Separated by fools
Who don't know what love is yet

But I want you to know
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen ever seen

It's like having a dream
Where nobody has a heart
It's like having it all
And watching it fall apart

And I would wait 'til the end of time for you
And do it again it's true
I'd do it again oh I mean it

And when you're down
And looking for some cheering up
I'll be here
To lift you up oh I'll never let you down

If you're feeling low
I know what you need
And I'll be there
To put my arms around you
And give you what you need
It's like having a dream
Where nobody has a heart
It's like having it all
And watching it fall apart

And I would wait 'til the end of time for you
And do it again it's true
I'd do it again oh I mean it

And if I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love like you've never seen
Ever seen
Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics for "Let Me Love You Tonight" by Pure Prairie League:

It's been so long you say you've had fun 
And you've been happy with the things you've done 
But we're gonna take a step and move along 
To where the grass is greener and the field is strong 

And if you say you wanna see the light 
It might take time but I'll tell you alright 
I'm gonna show you heaven every night 
Oh yeah Let Me Love You Tonight 

Well you've been around and I know that you've seen 
What it's like out there baby in between 
But if you give us a chance to get it right 
You're gonna see a change in me tonight 

And if you say you wanna see the light 
It might take time but I'll tell you alright 
I'm gonna show you heaven every night 
Oh yeah Let Me Love You Tonight 

We can take what we want and seal our fate 
Hold on to love that we know won't wait 
So why take less when we could have it all 
We'll have a life that only lovers can call 

And if you say you wanna see the light 
It might take time but I'll tell you alright 
I'm gonna show you heaven every night 
Oh yeah Let Me Love You Tonight 

And if you say you wanna see the light 
It might take time but I'll tell you alright 
I'm gonna show you heaven every night 
Oh yeah Let Me Love You Tonight
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late
Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice don't understand it
So I went home
Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
Oh but seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was hoping for a miracle
I gotta say it's been a while
You don't look like a lady
You don't have me feeling like a man
So please why don't you tell me
You'll never forget me
But the way that you treat me
Is bound to drive me away
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
One fine day you'll look at me
And you will know our love was meant to be
One fine day you're gonna want me for your girl
The arms I long for will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me right by your side
One fine day you're gonna want me for your girl

Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll be waiting and someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down oh

One fine day we'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day you're gonna want me for your girl

One fine day you're gonna want me for your girl
One fine day you're gonna want me for your girl
You and me we're no exception to the rule
I'm sorry babe but I've got to play it cool
I'm not in love it's just a game we do
For all my friends they're tryin' to talk to you

Dim all the lights sweet darling
'Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Love just don't come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up

Dim all the lights sweet honey
'Cause tonight it's all the way
All the lights the love in your eyes
Gonna make this party shine

All the night honey take it slow
Seems like everywhere we go
Romance is in the atmosphere
I'm gonna take you where the night never ends

I'll take you to a place
Where you can shimmer in the dark
And love's a groovy playground
Ain't no doubt about it

Dim all the lights sweet darling
'Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old Victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Dim all the lights sweet honey
'Cause tonight it's you and me
No need to worry darlin'
'Cause it's for eternity
Verse 1:
Darling I just can't believe it
Though I say it I still can't believe it
I didn't mean it
I just want you back by my side
Yeah
I've said things that I didn't mean
And I doubt if you'll ever believe me
But I tried and I hope it's not too late to say

Chorus:
Should've never let you go
Should've never let you go
Should've never let you go
Should've never let you go

Verse 2:
Darling I've been so lost without you
Feeling lonely and lost without you
My pride kept my feelings inside
But I couldn't make it without you
I never meant to cause you sorrow
I never meant to cause you pain
I just want to guarantee you won't be hurt again

Chorus

Bridge:
Ooh I thought I could make it on my own
But now I know it's just no good being alone
I'm holding you forever holding you for good
Never ever letting you go

Chorus x2
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Pilot of the Airwaves" by Charlie Dore:

 "Pilot of the airwaves here is my request
You don't have to play it but I hope you'll do your best
I've been listening to your show on the radio
And you seem like a friend to me"


Orchestra's playing those familiar sounds
Sung by Brendan Bowyer coming in from London town
But there's no orchestration no pipes or drum 
Here's what they play when the bird has flown


"Loneliness is a crowded room
Full of open hearts turned to stone
All together all alone
All at once my whole world had changed"


Now I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil in all direction
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long
Don't change for you don't change a thing for me


"Loneliness is a crowded room
Full of open hearts turned to stone
All together all alone
All at once my whole world had changed"


"Loneliness is a crowded room
Full of open arms turned to stone
All together all alone
All at once my whole world had changed"


"I'm glad you're playing what we want to hear
You've given us a choice
Cause we're all tired of bigotry and hatred in the air
Hey there pilot of the airwaves
This is my request and it's not a shame
Hey there pilot of the airwaves 
I'm your friend and my love you'll gain"
There's nothing I can do  
All that I want is  
To be near to you  
Tonight  
Repeat  
Lay down  
Next to me  
Don't listen when I scream  
Bury your doubts and fall asleep  
Find out  
I was just a bad dream  
Let the bed sheet  
Soak up my tears  
And watch the only way out of here  
Disappear  
Don't tell me why  
Kiss me goodbye  
For neither ever  
Nor never goodbye  
This is not  
You Will Be Missed
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Pledge My Love" by Peaches & Herb:

And never hurt you dear

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Long Run" by Eagles:



I used to hurry a lot I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day oh that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it I just couldn't admit it
I was a restless soul in need of a little education



Now this time I'm gone for good
I ain't no doctor but I'm feeling the cure
I don't need a preacher I need a nurse
Oh I don't need a lover just a shove oh my Lord



There's been times I've been mistaken
There's been times I've been misled
This time baby I'm gonna make it all up to you


I'm pickin' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream
I'm gonna make it right I'm gonna lay me down a better plan yeah




I'm runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen
My load I've got seven women on
My mind
 that wanna own me Two that wanna stone me One says she's a friend of mine


Take it easy take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me


Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid
Oh I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darlin' darlin'
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

And darlin' darlin'
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand stand by me
Stand by me

Darlin' darlin'
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand now stand by me
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me
Won't you stand now
Oh stand stand by me
Sure below are the uncensored lyrics of "Déjà Vu" by Dionne Warwick:

If I see you again
Will it be déjà vu
Or will it be the moment
That I remember you
Do you feel the same way too
I know we've met before
Was it in a dream
Or in a past life I'm not sure
But it feels like we've been more
I've got a funny feeling
That I've loved you before
And now I'm loving you again
It's déjà vu
Déjà vu
Déjà vu
I've got a funny feeling
That I've loved you before
And now I'm loving you again
It's déjà vu
Déjà vu
Déjà vu

So you think you're a Romeo
Playing a part in a picture-show
Take the long way home
Take the long way home


'Cause you're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good
Take the long way home
Take the long way home


But there are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
All the greenery is comin' down boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh it's peculiar she used to be so nice


When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home


You never see what you want to see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home


And when you're up on the stage it's so unbelievable
Oh unforgettable how they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh calamity is there no way out

Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fire


Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
I've always been one for big entrances
Fooling around


Now I've got a woman
Yeah we stick together now
I'm gonna love ya baby
Till the wheels come off


Oh baby I'll never leave ya
If you need a friend
I'll be your friend
Check it out


If you need a friend don't look to a stranger
You know in the end I'll always be there


But when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around
And I'll be there oh oh


I'm sorry 'bout the attitude
I need to give when I'm with you
But no one else will take this crap from me
And I'm just the kind of guy to

Let you think that you can take me
So if you want me
I'll be in the bar
Stay for just a while
Stay and let me look at you
It's been so long I hardly knew you
Standing in the door

Stay with me a while
I only wanna talk to you
We've traveled halfway 'round the world
To find ourselves again

September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

Look at what you've done
Why you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you cryin'
In the corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before

September morn
Do you remember how we danced the night away
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way
Verse 1:
There's no sense in pretending
Your love for me is gone
I won't stay around for the weekend
I'll be gone by dawn

Chorus:
Broken-hearted me
Won't somebody please believe
I loved him all my life
And how I depended on his love
To see me through the night
Broken-hearted me
It's a hard thing to be
When love goes on the rocks
And it starts to show on me
Verse 2:
Don't ask me how I'm feeling
I don't want you to know
The pain and all the heartache
That I'll face when I go

Chorus:
Broken-hearted me
Won't somebody please believe
I loved him all my life
And how I depended on his love
To see me through the night
Broken-hearted me
It's a hard thing to be
When love goes on the rocks
And it starts to show on me

Bridge:
I won't fall apart
Though I cried myself to sleep
I haven't lost my heart
'Cause I never gave it to him cheap

Chorus:
Broken-hearted me
Won't somebody please believe
I loved him all my life
And how I depended on his love
To see me through the night
Broken-hearted me
It's a hard thing to be
When love goes on the rocks
And it starts to show on me

Outro:
Broken-hearted me
All defamatory or obscene language has been removed from this transcript:

All my life was a paper once plain pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music ev'ry note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me
By the look on my face
And you decorated my life created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love
All over my heart
You decorated my life
Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony
Life meant nothin' to me until you came along
And you brought out the colors what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be
Shinin' soft in your eyes
And you decorated my life created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love
All over my heart
You decorated my life

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "In America" by Charlie Daniels Band:

Well the eagle's been flyin' slow
And the flag's been flyin' low
And a lotta people sayin' that America's fixin' to fall
Well speakin' just for me
And some people from Tennessee
We've got a thing or two to tell you all

This lady may have stumbled
But she ain't never failed
And if the Russians don't believe that
They can all go straight to hell

We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then
God bless America again

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again
In America did you
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
We damn sure fooled you

We're walkin' real proud
And we're talkin' real loud again
In America you never did think
That it ever would happen again

From the sound up in Long Island
Out to San Francisco Bay
And everything that's in between them is our own
And we may have done a little bit
Of fightin' amongst ourselves
But you outside people best leave us alone

'Cause we'll all stick together
And you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies
And the rebels and the yanks

You just go and lay your hand
On a Pittsburgh Steelers' fan
And I think you're gonna finally understand

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again
In America did you
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
We damn sure fooled you

We're walkin' real proud
And we're talkin' real loud again
In America you never did think
That it ever would happen again

I'm mighty glad you stayed
Our country's sure been blessed
And we'll be havin' us a party
When we take back the White House

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again
In America did you
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
We damn sure fooled you

We're walkin' real proud
And we're talkin' real loud again
In America you never did think
That it ever would happen again

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again
And you never did think
In America did you
And you never did think
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
And you never did think
We damn sure fooled you

And you never did think
We're walkin' real proud
And we're talkin' real loud again
And you never did think
In America
And you never did think
You never did think
That it ever would happen again
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Breakdown Dead Ahead" by Boz Scaggs:

Breakdown dead ahead
Won't ya take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride
I wanna move
Play with my money and take my chances with time

Breakdown dead ahead
Won't ya let me lay my heart on the line this time
I wanna move
Play with my money and take my chances with time

Out all night but I'm feeling okay
Don't wanna sit down get up and walkin' all over the place
I wanna move
Play with my money and take my chances with time

Ah breakdown breakdown dead ahead
I'm running low need your love to get me off of this bed

Spend all night waiting for the morning light

Breakdown breakdown dead ahead

We got somethin' we both know it we don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret all the same somehow we get around it
Listen it don't really matter to me baby
You believe what you wanna believe you see
You don't have to live like a refugee


Don't have to live like a refugee
Don't have to live like a refugee


Somewhere somehow somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Tell me why you wanna lay there
Revel in your abandon
Listen it don't make no difference to me baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free you see
You don't have to live like a refugee


Don't have to live like a refugee
Don't have to live like a refugee
No baby you don't have to live like a refugee


Baby we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lover's been burned
Right now this seems real to you
But it's one of those things you gotta feel to be true




Somewhere somehow somebody
Must have told you wrong
You're feeling like a victim of a selfish kind of love
We see right through your plastics and your furs
And we ain't sure what we're looking for
Hey baby you don't have to live like a refugee


Don't have to live like a refugee
Don't have to live like a refugee
No you don't have to live like a refugee


You don't have to live like a refugee
Don't have to live like a refugee
Unbowed unbent unbroken
I can see the truth in your eyes
That your love for me is real
But when I'm away from you darling
I need your love to feel

With you I'm born again
I can see the light
With you I'm born again
I'm living in paradise

That something you've got
The way that it holds me
Whenever you touch me girl
I'm just a prisoner of love
I'm just a victim of fate

But when we're together
I feel so alive
With you I'm born again
I can see the light
With you I'm born again
I'm living in paradise

I never knew love before
Then came you you
Then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you you
Then came you

With you I'm born again
I can see the light
With you I'm born again
I'm living in paradise

With you I'm born again
I can see the light
With you I'm born again
I'm living in paradise

I never knew love before
Then came you you

Don't let go don't let go
Have you ever loved someone
And then tried to leave them
You'll never understand
How much I need your love


Can't wait to see you
But uh you don't know
All my insides are in a whirl
Don't know whether to kiss you
Or kill you girl
Uh baby I'm amazed at the way
You love me all the time and maybe
I'm afraid of the feeling that's coming over me


Don't let go don't let go
Have you ever loved someone
And then tried to leave them
You'll never understand
How much I need your love


Can't wait to feel you
In my arms again
Can't stand the thought of you
With another man
Haven't got the heart to let
You go girl oh no
Baby I've got to have your lovin'
And I'll never let it go


Don't let go don't let go
Have you ever loved someone
And then tried to leave them
You'll never understand
How much I need your love


Don't let go don't let go
Don't let go don't let go
Don't let go don't let go
Don't let go don't let go
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Don't Do Me Like That" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers:

I was talking with a friend of mine
Said a woman had hurt his pride
Told him that she loved him so
And turned around and let him go
Then I got to thinking man that ain't right
That was Friday night
Yeah don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you baby
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I might need you baby
Don't do me like that
Listen honey can you see
Baby you would bury me
If you were in the public eye
Givin' someone else a try
And you know you better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you baby
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I might need you baby
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you baby
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I might need you baby
Don't do me like that

I hope that helps
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting any one
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said "Take me as I am"
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right
You may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don’t try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
Sure here are the complete and uncensored lyrics of "Off the Wall" by Michael Jackson:


When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way


So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall


All the pressure ain't that bad
If you get off your butt and jam
'Cause when the world looks at you and
It laughs it's just a crazy scene
You know you gotta have that feelin'
If you wanna be be a real king or queen
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way


So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove and let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall


Live it off the wall
Live it off the wall
Live it off the wall
Live it off the wall


You can shout out all you want to
Cause there ain't no sin in folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way


So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall


Live it off the wall
Live it off the wall
Live it off the wall
Live it off the wall


When you're livin' off the wall
Repeat and fade
Your love is like a tidal wave spinning over my head  
Drownin' me in your promises better left unsaid  
Your love is like a river always changing its course  
And I call you my heartbreaker don't you mess around with me  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I don't know what to do I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart
Well the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night

Steep grade up ahead slow me down makin' no time

Gotta keep rolling those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo

Keep piling on the miles gotta get me there


Said "Welcome to the home of the hillbilly yeah baby"

It's a land of barbed wire moonshine whiskey

Park your car try your luck at the state line

If you're looking for a good time


Well they got all your rowdy friends down in Nashville

And they're pickin' guitars and singin' all night long

Well they love to smoke and love to drink

And when a woman comes around they all start to sing


Said "Welcome to the home of the hillbilly yeah baby"

It's a land of barbed wire moonshine whiskey

Park your car try your luck at the state line

If you're looking for a good time


Well I'm drivin' my life away looking for a better way

For me I'd rather be alone than here today than gone tomorrow

I'm drivin' my life away nothing to hold me or tie me down

I'm just going to ride and keep on rollin' 'til I'm gone
Yes here are the uncensored lyrics of "Jojo" by Boz Scaggs:

By Boz Scaggs and David Paich

Jojo

Was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo
Left his home in Tucson Arizona
For some California grass

Get back get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jojo go home
Get back get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta go home
Get back get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back get back
Back to where you once belonged

Go home
Get back get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta go home
Get back get back
Back to where you once belonged fade out

I hope this helps
Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the moment
Give me the night
And if you give me the moment
I will want it all night long
With the dawn approaching
And the night remaining
You can find your magic
On the city streets
Lookin' good
And the chalet is groovin'
And the rhythm is so entrancing
There's no telling where the night will end
So come on and take a chance and
Feeling music's irresistible charm
Well I can feel it every time I'm in your arms
Give me the night
Give me the moment
Give me the night
And if you give me the moment
I will want it all night long
Sax solo
Give me the night
Give me the moment
Give me the night
And if you give me the moment
I will want it all night long
Lookin' good
Give me the night
Give me the moment
Give me the night
And if you give me the moment
I will want it all night long
Lookin' good
Give me the night
Give me the moment
Give me the night
Why yes I can Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Tusk" by Fleetwood Mac:

Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay  
Why don't you ask him if he's going away  
Why don't you tell me what's going on  
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone  

Who's going to take you back to the star beside you  
Who's going to take you back to the star  

When I'm down on my knees it's not the pleas that I'm needing  
It's the rope and tusk it's the rope and tusk  
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds  

And the ink stains that have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory  
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy  
Planted on their columns now that bind us  
Or something that somebody said  
Because they thought we fit together walking  

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my memory  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  
And the junkyards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see  
You walking on the back roads by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  

I dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin' cracklin' cauldron in some train yard  
My beard a-rufflin' cold-parked bench cushions 'neath the hardwoods  
Of the coach yard platform smokin' engine stokin'  
The world drops dead a-leafin' heavy from the trees  
They say that war's a-comin' goin' sangin' through the years  

Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay  
Why don't you ask him if he's going away  
Why don't you ask him if he's going to be coming back soon  
If he's going to be coming back soon

Verse 1:
He was a poor boy raised in a small town
Fatherless son of a hard livin' momma
She worked all day just to pay the rent
So he quit school and he got himself a job
Workin' eight hours livin' eight lives
It was a hand-to-mouth life a struggle to survive

Chorus:
But he said someday
I'm gonna live the American dream
I'm gonna be a self-made millionaire
I'm gonna be a big-time movie star
And I'm gonna see my name in lights
I'm gonna buy a mansion and a yacht
I'm gonna live a life as sweet as a cherry pie
I'm gonna be livin' proof of the American dream

Verse 2:
He worked his way up from the bottom to the top
With a dollar and a dream and a bit of good luck
He had a quick mind and a charming wit
And a knack for sellin' things that people didn't need
He could talk his way out of anything
And he made his fortune in the art of the deal

Chorus:
But he said someday
I'm gonna live the American dream
I'm gonna be a self-made millionaire
I'm gonna be a big-time movie star
And I'm gonna see my name in lights

I'm gonna live a life as sweet as a cherry pie
I'm gonna be livin' proof of the American dream

Verse 3:
He had it all the money and the fame
People knew his name they played his game
But he was never satisfied he always wanted more
More money more power more women on the score
He lived like a king but he felt like a pawn
And every night he woke up to a different dawn

Chorus:
But he said someday
I'm gonna live the American dream
I'm gonna be a self-made millionaire
I'm gonna be a big-time movie star

I'm gonna live a life as sweet as a cherry pie

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Wait for Me" by Hall & Oates:


Baby I know you're going away
Don't look back you're leaving today
Don't you cry now you know I'll miss you too
Just remember to do what you gotta do


Wait for me wait for me
I'll come running I'll come running
Wait for me wait for me

In every word you say to me

Well I woke up late this morning
My head was in a whirl
Only when I drink too much
Do I get myself a girl

I was feelin' kinda lonely
And my heart was cold as ice
Then I saw her looking at me
Yeah she had them bedroom eyes

All night long ooh baby
All night long yeah
All night long I'm your man baby
All night long yeah

Well I'm a free and easy type
Of the male species
I roam around from town to town
Just looking for my feast

But when I saw you standing there
Well I knew I had to try
To get it through your thick hair
That I'm your kind of guy

All night long ooh baby
All night long yeah
All night long I'm your man baby
All night long yeah

Well I'll buy you a drink or two
And I'll sing you a song or three
I know you've heard it all before
But what the hell you're new to me

So won't you be my queen tonight
And we'll make love in the backseat
I'm a harper run amok baby
And you're just what I need

All night long ooh baby

All night long I'm your man baby
All night long yeah

All night long ooh baby
All night long yeah

And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me
You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on

Chorus:
Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted
You'll see my love you'll see

Can't be drowned no you can't be denied
I'm for real and you know I won't mind
Knowing what's right I'll stand here by your side

Chorus x2
\  
It seems like yesterday  
But it was long ago  
Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights  
There in the darkness with the radio playin' low  
And the secrets that we shared  
The mountains that we moved  
Caught like a wildfire out of control  
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove  

\  
And I remember what she said to me  
How she swore that it never would end  
I remember how she held me oh so tight  
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then  

\  
Against the wind  
We were runnin' against the wind  
We were young and strong we were runnin' against the wind  
And the years rolled slowly past  
And I found myself alone  
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends  
I found myself further and further from my home and I guess  
I lost my way  
There were oh-so-many roads  
I was living to run and running to live  
Never worried about paying or even how much I owed  

\  
Breaking all of the rules that would bend  
I began to find myself searchin'  
Searchin' for shelter again and again  
Against the wind  
A little something against the wind  

\  
I found myself seeking shelter against the wind  
Well those drifters days are past me now  
I've got so much more to think about  
Deadlines and commitments  
What to leave in what to leave out  

\  
Against the wind  
I'm still runnin' against the wind  
I'm older now but still runnin' against the wind  
Well I'm older now and still runnin'  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  

\  
Still runnin'  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  
Still runnin'  
Against the wind  
Against the wind
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Coward of the County" by Kenny Rogers:


Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy but folks just called him yellow
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong


He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy:
"Son my life is over but yours has just begun"


Promise me son not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand:
Son you don't have to fight to be a man


There's someone for everyone and Tommy love's our only hope
And if you're looking for a hero that's not what you should be
But if you're looking for a savior we got One named Jesus
He's the only One who'll give to you and me


And Mama sent him off to school but he didn't come home til' late
But she didn't ask a single question she knew what he might say
And Tommy robbed the bank with a gun that shot his legs instead
His mama cried out to him knew her son was nearly dead


There's someone for everyone and Tommy love's our only hope
And if you're looking for a hero that's not what you should be
But if you're looking for a savior we got One named Jesus
He's the only One who'll give to you and me
Upside down

I'd be happy to provide the uncensored lyrics of "Ships" by Barry Manilow:

We walked to the sea
Just my father and me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air
Hangin’ still everywhere
Dressed in gray did he say
Hold my hand

I said “Love’s easier when it’s far away
We sat and watched a distant light
We’re two ships that pass in the night”

And we smile when we say it’s alright
We’re still here it’s just that we’re out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
There’s a boat on the line
Where the sea meets the sky
There’s another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I
Are like strangers
A wide ways apart as we drift on through the night
I said “Love’s easier when it’s far away
We sat and watched a distant light
We’re two ships that pass in the night”

And we smile when we say it’s alright
We’re still here it’s just that we’re out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

And just like that lonely night
We’re sailing through time
We’re two ships that pass in the night

And we smile when we say it’s alright
We’re still here it’s just that we’re out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We smile when we say it’s alright
We’re still here it’s just that we’re out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
I'd be happy to provide the uncensored lyrics of "Sexy Eyes" by Dr Hook:

I was sitting all alone watching people getting off
With each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor turning moving back and forth
They were lovers

One more lonely night
For me to face
But as I turned to leave
I saw her face

I said "Hey I never really knew your name
But I sure love the way that you look with those
Sexy eyes"

You're so beautiful tonight
And they're looking at me with those sexy eyes

One more dance before we say goodnight
I'm gonna hold her oh so tight
I'm gonna make it right tonight
I'm gonna make it right tonight

She said "Hey boy won't you take me home"
"My place it ain't too far and the night is still
So young"
So we went back to her place we were moving just one pace
At a time
She said "Come on let's sit and talk a while"
We talked about all the things we did
And we talk about all the things we will
With those sexy eyes

You're so beautiful tonight
And they're looking at me with those sexy eyes

One more dance before we say goodnight
I'm gonna hold her oh so tight
I'm gonna make it right tonight
I'm gonna make it right tonight

I was feeling so insecure with her I don't need to be no more
'Cause with her I'm never shy with her I don't have to try
With those sexy eyes

You're so beautiful tonight
And they're looking at me with those sexy eyes

One more dance before we say goodnight
I'm gonna hold her oh so tight
I'm gonna make it right tonight
I'm gonna make it right tonight

You're so beautiful tonight
And they're looking at me with those sexy eyes

One more dance before we say goodnight
I'm gonna hold her oh so tight
I'm gonna make it right tonight
I'm gonna make it right tonight

I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart


I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know doesn't really know


I'm all out of love I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong


I want you to come back and carry me home
away from this long lonely road
I reach for you and ya bring me your heart
When that love comes down without devotion well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm shoving aside the fear

So let's make it tonight Iknow you are right
When ya say that I can't get enough
