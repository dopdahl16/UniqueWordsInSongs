What what what what

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I I I'm hunting looking for a come up 
This is  awesome
Now walk into the club like "What up I got a big "
I'm just pumped I bought some  from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe it's so damn frosty
The people like "Damn That's a cold ass honkey"
Rollin' in hella deep headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes those are green
Draped in a leopard mink girls standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this smells like R Kelly's sheets
Pisssssss 
But  it was ninety-nine cents 
Yep
Bag it coppin' it washin' it 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy  it man
I am stuntin' and flossin' and
Savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain 
I'ma take your grandpa's style I'ma take your grandpa's style
No for real ask your grandpa "Can I have his hand-me-downs"
Thank you 
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket then I bought a kneeboard 
Hello hello my ace man my Mello 
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game hell no
I could take some Pro Wings make them cool sell those
The sneaker heads would be like "Ah he got the Velcro"

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm I'm I'm hunting looking for a come up 
This is  awesome
Is that your grandma's coat 
Thank you 
The built-in onesie with the socks on that 
I hit the party and they stop in that 
They be like "Oh that Gucci that's hella tight"
I'm like "Yo that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt"
Limited edition let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt that's just  ridiculous
I call that getting swindled and pimped 
I call that getting tricked by a business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't 
Peep game come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand Then you hella won't
Then you hella won't

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm I'm I'm hunting looking for a come up 
This is  awesome
Alright here are the uncensored lyrics for "Blurred Lines" by Robin Thicke featuring TI and Pharrell Williams:


Everybody get up woo
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey


If you can't hear what I'm trying to say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf maybe I'm going blind
Maybe I'm out of my mind


Okay now he was close
Tried to domesticate ya
But you're an animal
Baby it's in your nature
Just let me liberate ya
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take ya


Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead get at me


Tell me what do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on what do we need ropes for
You the hottest bitch in this place
I feel so lucky hey hey hey
You wanna hug me
What rhymes with hug me
Okay now he was close
Tried to domesticate ya
But you're an animal
Baby it's in your nature
Just let me liberate ya
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take ya


Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead get at me


Everybody get up

Return of the Mack get up
What it is what it does what it is what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
Get up Fresh out pimp strut walking little bit of humble little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby sweater game nope nope y'all can't copy
Yup Bad moonwalking this here is our party my posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way grown music I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustling
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the Forties busting
Halfway cross that city with the backpack fat cat crushing
Labels out here nah they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people spread it across the country
Labels out here nah they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people spread it across the country


Can we go back
This is the moment
Tonight is the night we'll fight till it's over
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us


Now can I kick it Thank you Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts but that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me go hard like I gotta eat on a street where did Picasso go
That's that rap shit I have them tennis shoes these is my recliners
King's in my village made of gold
Ripped sleeves sweatshirt denim we don't give a damn
Studded leather weather everyday Christmas
Gave Santa Claus a hug and I thanked him for that draws that's a wish list
High five I'm rocking with a good vibe
We're slowing down we're on a highway
Haters say "You switched up your style you don't sound the same"
I said "I'm glad you came"
I'm still who I am underneath this grade
The forecast said it was cloudy
But I'm for sure it's sunny I'll be there for a rainy day
It's how I stay on my hustle
And take control of things
I'm running the game I ain't asking for the ball back
Everything I'm throwing small stack
It's caught like Adam with the Moss at
Damn X2


Can we go back
This is the moment
Tonight is the night we'll fight till it's over
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us


Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say


Can we go back
This is the moment
Tonight is the night we'll fight till it's over
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Aren't you somethin' to admire
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side


'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you baby it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along


It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror


Aren't you somethin' an original
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me I love that about you
And if I could I
Would look at us all the time


'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you baby it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along


It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror


Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me baby
Keep your eyes on me


'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you baby it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along


It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim

I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep oh oh
Things you never say to me oh oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
Oh we had everything
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind

Yeah but this is happenin'
You've been havin' real bad dreams
oh oh
Oh oh
You used to lie so close to me
oh oh
Oh oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love our love
Oh our love our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink

No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like ooh ooh ooh hoo ooh
Mm too young too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing but she's dancing with another man
My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never never get to clean up the mess I made oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like ooh ooh ooh hoo ooh
Mm too young too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing but she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man
Baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby
Yeah when I first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought "Oh good lord she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio's playin' that country song
Cliche a little Shania baby don't you know
Play it again play it again play it again
Baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck
And said "Fire it up let's go get this thing stuck"
Baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It'd look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on
Whoo hoo

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly agree politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing so I fell for everything


You held me down but I got up hey
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all I see it now


I got the eye of the tiger a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar


Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero to my own hero
You held me down but I got up hey
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all I see it now


I got the eye of the tiger a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Yeah yeah

All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air said "Show me something"
He said "If you dare come a little closer"


Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you yeah
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay stay

The reason I hold on
'Cause I need this hole gone
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving


Not really sure how to feel about it

Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay stay

Oh the reason I hold on

Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you yeah

Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planets spinning uh
The force of love beginning

Verse 1:
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn-up town no post code envy

Chorus:
But every song's like
Gold teeth Grey Goose trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains ball gowns trashin' the hotel room
We don't care we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal Maybach diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes islands tigers on a gold leash
We don't care we aren't caught up in your love affair

Verse 2:
And we'll never be royals royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Chorus:
Let me be your ruler ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago  
I was in your sights you got me alone  
You found me you found me you found me  
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that  
And when I fell hard you took a step back  
Without me without me without me  
And he's long gone when he's next to me  
And I realize the blame is on me  
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I'd never been  
'Til you put me down oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I'd never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground oh  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
No apologies He'll never see you cry  
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why  
You're drowning you're drowning you're drowning  
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street  
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be  
He was long gone when he met me  
And I realize the joke is on me  
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I'd never been  
'Til you put me down oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I'd never been  
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble  
And the saddest fear comes creeping in  
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
So shame on me now  
Flew me to places I'd never been  
'Til you put me down oh  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
Trouble trouble trouble  
I knew you were trouble when you walked in  
Trouble trouble trouble

Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now

All you ever did was wreck me  
Yeah you you wreck me
Feeling my way through the darkness  
Guided by a beating heart  
I can't tell where the journey will end  
But I know where to start



They tell me I'm too young to understand  
They say I'm caught up in a dream  
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes  
Well that's fine by me



So wake me up when it's all over  
When I'm wiser and I'm older  
All this time I was finding myself  
And I didn't know I was lost



I tried carrying the weight of the world  
But I only have two hands  
Hope I get the chance to travel the world  
But I don't have any plans



Wish that I could stay forever this young  
Not afraid to close my eyes  
Life's a game made for everyone  
And love is a prize



So wake me up when it's all over  
When I'm wiser and I'm older  
All this time I was finding myself  
And I didn't know I was lost



So wake me up when it's all over  
When I'm wiser and I'm older  
All this time I was finding myself  
And I didn't know I was lost

Two bottle 'a whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company

Yes I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Holy Grail" by Jay-Z featuring Justin Timberlake:


You'd take the clothes of my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don't know why why our love is so much
Ohhh


You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets dirty or clean
Give it up for fame but I still don't know why
Why I love it so much

Yeah
And baby it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here one day you're there one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from the cup
'Til it runneth over Holy Grail


Blue told me to remind you n****s
F**k that shit y'all talkin' 'bout I'm the n***a
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that sh*t did to Hammer
God-dammit it I like it
Bright lights is enticing but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night thirty mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows all the pigeons take flight
F*** the fame keep cheat codes
I'll put you on to the real rules
I'll show you how to do this youngin'
No paper trail nope no takin' photos
I'm a grown man just give me mine
Get up off my d**k and tell your b**** to come here


You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets dirty or clean
Give it up for fame but I still don't know why
Why I love it so much

Yeah
And baby it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here one day you're there one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from the cup
'Til it runneth over Holy Grail


Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho b**ches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk see 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the f*** I'm kidding though
I'm getting high sitting low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain works
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
N**** deal with it this s*** ain't work
This light work camera snapping my eyes hurt
N***as dying back where I was birthed
F*** your iris and IRS


Get up out my business
Understand me girl it's not your business not your business
I know "Holy Grail" I know
You'd take the clothes off my back nigga
And I'd let you I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out of my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it I still love you still love you


I still don't know why
Why I love you so much yeah
And you curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets dirty or clean
Give it up for fame but I still don't know why
Why I love it so much

Yeah
And baby it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here one day you're there one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from the cup
'Til it runneth over Holy Grail

Bring the action

High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends


A clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again


Walk on through a red parade
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes
Us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'll choose


If you pull then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you


Why are you my clarity
Why are you my remedy
Why are you my clarity
Why are you my remedy


If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy
If our love's insanity why are you my clarity
Sail

This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my ADD baby
This is how an angel dies
I blame it on my own supply
Blame it on my ADD baby

Sail

Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself myself
Blame it on my ADD baby
Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my ADD baby

There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes  
In a happy home I was a king I had a golden throne  
Those days are gone now the memories are on the wall  
I hear the songs from the places where I was born  
Upon the hill across the blue lake  
That's where I had my first heartbreak  
I still remember how it all changed  
My father said  
"Don't you worry don't you worry child  
See heaven's got a plan for you  
Don't you worry don't you worry now"  
Yeah
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

You're on a different road I'm in the Milky Way
You want me down on Earth but I am up in space
You're so damn hard to please we gotta kill this switch

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Daylight" by Maroon 5:
Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast

This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know when I wake I will have to slip away
Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms so beautiful
The sky is getting bright the stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard 'cause I know
When the sun comes up I will leave
This is my last glance that will soon be memory

I never wanted to stop because I don't wanna start all over start all over
I was afraid of the dark but now it's all that I want all that I want all that I want

And I know that I can't be the only one
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feel
What I feel when I'm
With you with you with you with you with you oh

Girl I gotta go oh oh oh
I gotta leave but I'll miss you
I'll miss you
So I'm letting you go
And I'm giving you to the world
But I'll miss you
I'll miss you
Tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight

'Cause I know when the sun comes up
I will leave this is my last glance
That will soon be memory
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Oh-woah

Ask for money and get advice
Ask for advice get money twice
I'm from the dirty but that chico nice
Ya'll call it a moment I call it life


One day while the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional we stop keeping score
You and I get sick yeah I know that we can't do this no more

But baby there you again there you again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you no but my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

But baby there you again there you again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night

Be careful making wishes in the dark dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite


My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up oh oh oh
Light 'em up oh oh oh
Light 'em up oh oh oh
I'm on fire
So light 'em up oh oh oh

Meantime just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite


Saw you at your worst
And it still hurts
Your stones and sticks
Your no's and it's
Don't break my heart
And I won't break your heart-shaped glasses
Little girl little girl you should close your eyes


Be careful making wishes in the dark dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
Meantime just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite


You are the flaw in my plans
But I'm the execution

And the lies I weave are oh so intricate
Oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa oh oh whoa

I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

Yeah Young Money
Nicki Minaj Justin

So just forget about the world we're young tonight

Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do


Body rock girl I can feel your body rock
Take a bow you're on the hottest ticket now
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world we're young tonight

Beauty beauty and the beast

Beast beauty from the streets we don't get deceased
Every time a beauty on the beats


Yeah yeah yeah oh
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete hey mama
It's all 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do


Breathes heavily

Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm


When I was in the third grade I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw my uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom tears rushing down my face
She's like "Ben you've loved girls since before Pre-K"
Trippin' yeah I guess she had a point didn't she
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like "Yeah I'm good at little league"
A preconceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
Man-made rewiring of a predisposition
Playing God aw nah here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And God loves all his children is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five-hundred years ago
I don't know


And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love my love my love
She keeps me warm she keeps me warm


If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately
"Man that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We become so numb to what we're sayin'
A culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
It's human rights for everybody there is no difference
Live on And be yourself
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal damn right I support it


And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love my love my love
She keeps me warm she keeps me warm


We press play don't press pause
Progress march on
With the veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up


Love is patient love is kind
Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude
Love does not demand its own way
Love is not irritable and it keeps no record of when it has been wronged
It is never glad about injustice but rejoices whenever truth wins out
Love never gives up never loses faith
It's always hopeful and endures through every circumstance
Prop 8 and DOMA man fuck who am I kiddin'
All my gay friends did it offend you
Then it probably did
Justice and liberty for all
Just word for some
Aww you think I'm not accustomed to love
Well I'm-a prove you wrong
I'm not abandoning beliefs I'm giving up on them
Most of them are wrong
I won't be made a scapegoat of oppression
We gon' rise up like a phoenix
And bring a dawn before a new morning


And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love my love my love
She keeps me warm she keeps me warm
My love my love my love
She keeps me warm she keeps me warm

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with the word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper it's the worst emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now


So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing


And it's hard to learn and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing


And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing


So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off I'm feeling alive

Oh my God I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

I've got that summertime summertime sadness
S-s-summertime summertime sadness

Got that summertime summertime sadness
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies
Late is better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive

I've got that summertime summertime sadness
S-s-summertime summertime sadness

Got that summertime summertime sadness
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

I've got that summertime summertime sadness
S-s-summertime summertime sadness

Got that summertime summertime sadness
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Hold on to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave is stringing us along
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm going to make this place your home

Settle down it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost you can always be found

Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm going to make this place your home

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Settle down it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down

Settle down it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost you can always be found

Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm going to make this place your home

Ah-ah-ah-ah

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

If you get lost you can always be found
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm going to make this place your home
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Lose yourself in the rhythm of the music
Don't you worry 'bout the world it'll keep turning
Just follow your heart and see where it takes you
We're all gonna be alright

It's time to begin isn't it
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles
Of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back

I'm never changing who I am

Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin isn't it
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin isn't it
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

Verse 1: Alicia Keys
She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Feeling with catastrophe but she knows she can fly away

Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys
Oh she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

Chorus: Alicia Keys
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Verse 2: Alicia Keys
Looks like a girl but she's a flame
So bright she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name

Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys
Oh she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh she got her head in the clouds
And she's not coming down

Chorus: Alicia Keys
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Verse 3: Nicki Minaj
Spirit of Marilyn calling me audibly
Bawling she said that she would never leave
Continued to torture me
Telling me to come with her
Underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her
Pills and some rum with her
Tip me on the balcony telling me to jump with her
Yeah I'm in the ghost but I ain't doing stunts with her
I ain't trying to be that
Haters wanna see that
But I got ‘em aggy
Cause I win the gold like Gabby

Chorus: Alicia Keys
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Outro: Alicia Keys
Oh oh oh oh
She's just a girl and she's on fire
Putting my disclaimer forward that these lyrics may contain explicit language and/or content:

Putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that I think I'd have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said "Yes" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you I'm never good enough
When I don't care I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair then make 'em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels yes you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack x2
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good but you know it hurts
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack x2
The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning I'd rather be numb
And there's no one else to blame
So scared I take off and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames
You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that I think I'd have a heart attack x2

I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow yeah
But if I fall for you I'll never recover
If I fall for you I'll never be the same


I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you can take me all the way you can take me all the way


When you touch me it's like fire
And your kiss is like a taste of honey
And I'll be damned if I'll give up on you
I'll never give up on you


I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only halfway there
But you can take me all the way you can take me all the way


You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today don't leave me tomorrow yeah
But if I fall for you I'll never recover
If I fall for you I'll never be the same


I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only halfway there
But you can take me all the way you can take me all the way
Well I came home  
Like a stone  
And I fell heavy into your arms  
These days of dust  
Which we've known  
Will blow away with this new sun  

But I'll kneel down  
Wait for now  
And I'll kneel down  
Know my ground  

And I will wait I will wait for you  
And I will wait I will wait for you  
So break my step  
And relent  
Well you forgave and I won't forget  

Know what we've seen  
And him with less  
Now in some way  
Shake the excess  

But I will wait I will wait for you  
And I will wait I will wait for you  
And I will wait I will wait for you  
And I will wait I will wait for you  

So I'll be bold  
As well as strong  
And use my head alongside my heart  
So take my flesh  
And fix my eyes  
That tethered mind free from the lies  

But I'll kneel down  
Wait for now  
I'll kneel down  
Know my ground  

Raise my hands  
Paint my spirit gold  
And bow my head  
Keep my heart slow  

But I will wait I will wait for you  
And I will wait I will wait for you  
And I will wait I will wait for you  
And I will wait I will wait for you
If there's a specific uncensored version you'd like me to provide please let me know But here are the uncensored lyrics to the standard version of "Try" by Pink:

Oh oh
Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better
To never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try

Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try

Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Down there in the darkness
There's a light that I need found
I know it's too late
But you see I'm still around

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try

Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

Try try try

Headed down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh I can see my baby tonight


So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me


Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays a guitar I pick a banjo now
Oh North country winters keep a-gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't a-turnin' back to livin' that old life no more


So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me


Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap 
To Johnson City Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free


So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

I just wanna hold you tight
Never let you go
Know you give me butterflies
When you come around
And you know that I
Got the fire in my heart for you
My heart for you
I see you light Just like a star
You burned me up inside
I try but I can't seem to get away
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

Some nights I stay up cashin' in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw


Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off


But I still wake up I still see your ghost
Oh Lord I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for What do I stand for
Most nights I don't know anymore


This is it boys this is war what are we waiting for
Why don't we break the rules already
I was never one to believe the hype save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style


And that's alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight
Oh who am I Oh who am I Oh who am I
Well some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights I always win I always win


When I hear "the rain the rain"
Oh how it rages


And I fall once again
And that's alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight
Oh who am I Oh who am I Oh who am I
Well some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights I always win
I always win


Oh who am I Mmm
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Boys 'Round Here" by Blake Shelton featuring Pistol Annies and Friends:

Red red red red red red redneck
Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ole Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At a honky-tonk where their boots stomp
All night; what
That's right
Yea and what they call work digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground before the rain come down
To get paid to get the girl
In your 4 wheel drive A country boy can survive
Yea yea
What y'all think about that
Yea yea
Now that's what I'm talking about
Yea yea


Hey and don't forget about the cowboy y'all
Round here we're always on a mountain high
Moguls to the hollers and rivers to the fields
Boys 'round here we's up for anything
Bilin' crawfish sippin' on suds
Gotta wash it down with some king cold Bud
Chillin' with my friends talking 'bout cars
Gettin' rowdy round to all hours of the night
That's right


You know y'all goin' to the lake and I'm goin' to the river
But I'll be down in "Y'all Holler"
Yeah I'm chasin' that neon rainbow


Hey and don't forget about the cowboy y'all
Round here we're always on a mountain high
Moguls to the hollers and rivers to the fields
Boys 'round here we's up for anything
Bilin' crawfish sippin' on suds
Gotta wash it down with some king cold Bud
Chillin' with my friends talking 'bout trucks
The only way we know to do it just gettin' our country on


You with me
Yeah yeah
There's a party up in here
Y'all
You with me
Yeah
And don't it feel good
That's right


Hey and don't forget about the cowboy y'all
Round here we're always on a mountain high
Moguls to the hollers and rivers to the fields
Boys 'round here we's up for anything
Bilin' crawfish sippin' on suds
Gotta wash it down with some king cold Bud
Talking 'bout girls
Talking 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out kicking up dust
The boys 'round here


Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit don't take no shit
Chew tobacco chew tobacco chew tobacco spit
Aw heck
When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie cheat I'll beg and bribe
To make you well to make you well

When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well to make you well

Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me
And I would do it for you
For you

Baby I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone gone gone

When you fall like a statue
I'm gon' be there to catch you
Put you on your feet you on your feet
And if your well is empty
Not a thing will prevent me
Tell me what you need what do you need

I surrender honestly
You've always done the same for me
So I would do it for you
For you

Baby I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone gone gone

You're my back bone you're my cornerstone
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving
You're my head start you're my rugged heart
You're the pulse that I've always needed

Like a drum baby don't stop beating
Like a drum baby don't stop beating
Like a drum baby don't stop beating
Like a drum my heart never stops beating
For you for you

Baby I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone

Baby I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone gone gone
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

When the curtain's call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down
But I am hellbound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Yeah they say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars


Yeah we'll be counting stars


I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find


Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie could lie could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive


Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars


Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned


Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
I know caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little

Can't find can't find the reason
Why I'm so caught up in seasons
Out of time why oh why
Couldn't I see that I felt like a failure

When you're incomplete
Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on
My heart's a battlefield
That's why I'm singing this song

Can't win for losing
But I'm still here bruising
Feels like I keep choosing
To let myself down

I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little

Can't hide it's true I'm wide open
All I know I'm lost in emotion
Out of time could I be
The only one who didn't see

When you're incomplete
Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on
My heart's a battlefield
That's why I'm singing this song

Can't win for losing
But I'm still here bruising
Feels like I keep choosing
To let myself down

I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little

It's hard to follow
But that's a lead
As I walk away
I hope you see how
I'm crying just a little

When you're incomplete
Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on
My heart's a battlefield
That's why I'm singing this song

Can't win for losing
But I'm still here bruising
Feels like I keep choosing
To let myself down

I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little

I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
Don't listen to a word I say

The screams all sound the same

Though the truth may vary

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Hey

Don't listen to a word I say

The screams all sound the same

Though the truth may vary

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone gone gone away

I watched you disappear

All that's left is a ghost of you

Now we're torn torn torn apart

There's nothing we can do

Just let me go we'll meet again soon

Now wait wait wait for me

Please hang around

I'll see you when I fall asleep

Hey

Don't listen to a word I say

The screams all sound the same

Though the truth may vary

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Hey

Don't listen to a word I say

The screams all sound the same

Though the truth may vary

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone gone gone away

I watched you disappear

All that's left is a ghost of you

Now we're torn torn torn apart

There's nothing we can do

Just let me go we'll meet again soon

Now wait wait wait for me

Please hang around

I'll see you when I fall asleep

Hey

Don't listen to a word I say

The screams all sound the same

Though the truth may vary

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Hey

Don't listen to a word I say

The screams all sound the same

Though the truth may vary

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Hey

The screams all sound the same

Though the truth may vary

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Hey

Don't listen to a word I say

The screams all sound the same

Though the truth may vary

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

In the beginning it was just me and my team
We livin' like a dream
Uh-huh yeah
Had to take my mind off everything
And just grind and get this money


I know it's up there somewhere
I wanna go I gotta get there
You should know we're just two rebels
Who'll never be coming down


I wanna stay by your side mmm
And catch a vibe on these haters
Don't let 'em dim our light nah uh-huh
We're unstoppable mmm
I'll let you know when the time's right
But for now let's enjoy our youth
Cuz we're only getting older E-E-Yeah


I know it's up there somewhere
I wanna go I gotta get there
You should know we're just two rebels
Who'll never be coming down


I'm seeing the pain seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you 'body but me 'body but us
Bodies together
I love to hold you close tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you


I know it's up there somewhere
I wanna go I gotta get there
You should know we're just two rebels
Who'll never be coming down


Get off the ground yeah
Oh whoa
We keep on climbing oh
Higher and higher whoa

Now this shit's about to kick off this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad 'cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale well that's my pigment
'bout to go ham ya bish shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim bitch
The art of MC-ing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym bitch


Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berserk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berserk all night long


We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause it's mayhem 'til the am
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go let yourself go
Say "fuck it" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berserk
Shake your body


Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed ain't it
Khaki's pressed Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced so I guess it ain't
Dead after shave of cologne that made 'em just faint 
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint 
So if love is a chess game check mate 
But girl your body's banging jump me in freckles 
And porcupine quills I probably will
End up falling over or something cuz I'm Jell-O
But for now let me get my mind off that
I'm trying to find where the fuck I placed my attention span
*huh* 
Ended up delaying it more now but I'm on the clock
So my sanity's gone I'm on the pot
Like I'm taking a dump but I'm just figuratively talking
Figuratively stalking MC's figuratively really good at
Breaking these bars down {*laughs*} **burrrp** it's a wrap cause I'm just


Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berserk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berserk all night long


We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause it's mayhem 'til the am
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go let yourself go
Say "fuck it" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berserk
Everybody go berserk


Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berserk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berserk all night long
I'll see what I can do Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Catch My Breath" by Kelly Clarkson:

I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time
Catching my breath letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath no one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath won't let them get me down
It's all so simple now
Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith kinda comes around
I'll spent the rest of my life
Catching my breath letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath no one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath won't let them get me down
It's all so simple now
You helped me see
The beauty in everything
Catching my breath letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of this show
Now that you know this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath no one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath won't let them get me down
It's all so simple now
Throw it throw it up 
Watch it all fall out 
Pour it up pour it up 
That's how we ball out 
Strip clubs and dollar bills 
I still got my money 
Patron shots can I get a refill 
I still got my money 

Strippers goin' up and down that pole 
And I still got my money 
Four o'clock and we ain't going home 
Cause I still got my money 
Money make the world go round 
I still got my money 
Bands make your girl go down 
I still got my money 

All I see is signs all I see is dollar signs 
Money on my mind money money on my mind 
Throw it throw it up 
Watch it all fall out 
Pour it up pour it up 
That's how we ball out 

All I see is signs all I see is dollar signs 
Money on my mind money money on my mind 
Throw it throw it up 
Watch it all fall out 
Pour it up pour it up 
That's how we ball out 

Strippers goin' up and down that pole 
And I still got my money 
Four o'clock and we ain't going home 
Cause I still got my money 
Money make the world go round 
I still got my money 
Bands make your girl go down 
I still got my money 

All I see is signs all I see is dollar signs 
Money on my mind money money on my mind 
Throw it throw it up 
Watch it all fall out 
Pour it up pour it up 
That's how we ball out 

All I see is signs all I see is dollar signs 
Money on my mind money money on my mind 
Throw it throw it up 
Watch it all fall out 
Pour it up pour it up 
That's how we ball out 

Strippers goin' up and down that pole 
And I still got my money 
Four o'clock and we ain't going home 
Cause I still got my money 
Money make the world go round 
I still got my money 
Bands make your girl go down 
I still got my money 

All I see is signs all I see is dollar signs 
Money on my mind money money on my mind 
Throw it throw it up 
Watch it all fall out 
Pour it up pour it up 
That's how we ball out 

All I see is signs all I see is dollar signs 
Money on my mind money money on my mind 
Throw it throw it up 
Watch it all fall out 
Pour it up pour it up 
That's how we ball out
Lyrics of "22" by Taylor Swift:

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes uh-uh uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh-uh uh-uh

Yeah
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical oh yeah

Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time uh-uh
Uh-uh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're twenty-two uh-uh uh-uh

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Twenty-two uh-uh uh-uh

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded too many cool kids
Ah-ah-ah-ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical oh yeah

Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time uh-uh
Uh-uh

I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're twenty-two uh-uh uh-uh

Oh-oh whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're twenty-two uh-uh uh-uh

22 uh-uh uh-uh

I don't know about you 22 uh-uh uh-uh
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're twenty-two uh-uh uh-uh

Mmm I'm booking myself a one way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
And telling myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you baby is a waste of time

Yeah our first date girl the seasons changed
It got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah I know it's crazy


But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah I don't want easy I want crazy


You with me baby Let me know
Or maybe you're just plain got crazy lately
You drive me crazy baby I need you to save me
Call me ASAP or else I'll go crazy


But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah I don't want easy I want crazy


Yeah look at us baby tonight
The midnight rules are breaking
Gonna be a hell of a time
Yeah we're making it


But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss it doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah I don't want easy I want crazy
Dog goes woof cat goes meow
Bird goes tweet and mouse goes squeak
Cow goes moo frog goes croak
And the elephant goes toot

Ducks say quack and fish go blub
And the seal goes ow ow ow
But there's one sound that no one knows
What does the fox say

Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow

What does the fox say
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho

What does the fox say
Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff
Tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff
Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff

What the fox say
Big blue eyes pointy nose
Chasing mice and digging holes
Tiny paws up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

Your fur is red so beautiful
Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet a friendly horse
Will you communicate by mo-o-o-o-orse

Mo-o-o-o-orse
Mo-o-o-o-orse
How will you speak to that ho-o-o-o-orse

What does the fox say
Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow

What the fox say
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow

What the fox say
A-hee-ahee ha-hee
A-hee-ahee ha-hee
A-hee-ahee ha-hee

What does the fox say
The secret of the fox
Ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding

What is your sound
Will we ever know
Will always be a mystery
What do you say

You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods
What is your sound
Wa-o-o-o wawawa-o-o-o
Wa-o-o-o wawawa-o-o-o

What does the fox say
Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow
Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow

What the fox say

Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow

What the fox say
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho

Maybe it's the way she walked Wow
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards Wow
Just like she already owned it


I said "Can you give it back to me"
She said "Never in your wildest dreams"


And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever


I think it went oh oh oh
I think it went yeah yeah yeah
I think it goes oh


Said her name was Georgia Rose Wow
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth Wow
But she kissed me like she meant it


And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever


I think it went oh oh oh
I think it went yeah yeah yeah
I think it goes

You know I know you know I'll remember you
And I know you know I know you'll remember me
And you know I know you know I'll remember you
And I know you know I hope you'll remember how we danced
How we danced


And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever


I think it went oh oh oh
Said her name was Georgia Rose Oh oh oh
And her daddy was a dentist Oh oh oh
Laughing on the school bus playing games with our friends
I can't believe you're not here we should all just be together
Laughing on the school bus playing games with our friends
I can't believe you're not here we should all be together


Oh oh oh oh
Best song ever
It was the best song ever
White lips pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Light's gone day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly for angels to fly

Ripped gloves raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Weary-eyed dry throat
Call girl no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
Verse 1:
Well I woke up to the sound of silence the cars
Were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains in the moment of truth

Pre-Chorus:
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long

Chorus:
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me talk some sense to me
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie Yeah
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me talk some sense to me
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie

Verse 2:
I don't have a clue if you'll ever change your tune
But I'm here still holding on for dear life ah
Pause and take a breath and let the moment pass
Right here and right now is all we have

Pre-Chorus:
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And darling I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I’m at one and I've been silent for too long

Chorus:
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me talk some sense to me
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie Yeah yeah
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me talk some sense to me
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie

Bridge:
I dare you to walk away
I dare you to walk away
I dare you to find a better place
I dare you I dare you
I dare you to walk away I dare you to walk away
I dare you to walk away I dare you to walk away
I dare you to walk away I dare you I dare you

Chorus:
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me talk some sense to me
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
I found love where it wasn't supposed to be
Right in front of me talk some sense to me
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie

Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes


I can't live without you I can't live without you baby
I can't live without you I can't live without you baby
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive


The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do I do


I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat yeah
I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
Trying not to think about turning around
You're trying to keep the headlights shining on the road
And the song goes


I can't live without you I can't live without you baby
I can't live without you I can't live without you baby
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive


The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do I do


Oh I know you're headed for a foreign land
But you got a wonderin' soul
And I know this life is a hard one
But you gotta go
But the highway won't hold you tonight


The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do I do


The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do I do


I do I do

Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank


Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels some people want to kill their sorrows
Some people want to fit in with the popular that was my problem
I was in a dark room loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me:


Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank


Okay party people in the house
You're about to witness something you've never witnessed before
Yes it's the original human beat box Doug E Fresh
And his partner the grand wizard MC Ricky D
D and that's me in the place to be
We're gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
To the black to the white the red and the brown the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along
And next on the microphone is my man Hank come on Hank sing that song


Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank


Back to reality oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked
He's so mad but he won't give up that easy no
He won't have it he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter he's dope he knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's back to the lab again yo
This whole rhapsody he better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and


Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank
I'll just provide you the lyrics without any additional context

I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two  
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you  
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on  
Baby it's your call no pressure at all  
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter  
And lean a little closer  
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild  
And when the night is almost over  
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat  
And do a little bit of country song hanging on  
You don't have to keep me fallin' like this  
But it'd sure be cool if you did  
You can't shoot me down cause you've already knocked me dead  
Got me falling apart with my feet barely on the ground  
And I'm already torn torn  
So baby if you're feeling something  
Feel it with me yeah  
If you wanna break free you know where I'll be  
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter  
And lean a little closer  
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild  
And when the night is almost over  
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat  
And do a little bit of country song hanging on  
You don't have to keep me fallin' like this  
But it'd sure be cool if you did  
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild  
And when the night is almost over  
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat  
And do a little bit of country song hanging on  
You don't have to keep me fallin' like this  
But it'd sure be cool if you did  
Yeah it'd sure be cool if you did

You won't find him drinking at the tables
Rolling dice and staying out 'til three
You won't ever find him being unfaithful
You will find him you'll find him next to me


You won't find him trying to chase the devil
For money fame for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him you'll find him next to me


Next to me ooh-hooo
Next to me ooh-hooo
Next to me ooh-hooo


You won't find him trying to be clever
To save his life or make a wrong right
You won't ever find him saying 'no' to you
You will find him you'll find him next to me


You won't find him caught up in the life he leaves
You'll find him you'll find him next to me
Next to me ooh-hooo
Next to me ooh-hooo
Next to me ooh-hooo


When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
Cause I'll find him I'll find him next to me


When the skies are gray and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I'll find him I'll find him next to me


Next to me ooh-hooo
Next to me ooh-hooo
Next to me ooh-hooo
Hey girl you make me wanna write a song
And it goes like Ooh
I love you more than you could know
Wanna shout it out but I'm not that bold
I'm just the guy you're lookin' for
And when you're with me baby I know for sure

Chorus
It's like one two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated
We've been there it's safe to say it
Ain't nothin' like this you and me
And it goes like
Hey girl I'm just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I'm more a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy

So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is
Ahh whatever happened to 
Waitin' your turn doing it all by hand
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

Chorus
It's like one two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated
We've been there it's safe to say it
Ain't nothin' like this you and me
And it goes like
Hey girl you make me wanna write a song
Sit you down I'll sing it to you all night long
I've had a melody in my head since she walked in here and knocked me dead
Yeah girl
It goes like hey girl I'm just a small town run around
Same old boy you've seen around
Ain't too proud to step down
And say I'm just a good ole boy hey y'all
But honey you got me beat
Ain't no need to complicate it we both know
That's overrated we've been there
It's safe to say it ain't worth a try

Chorus
It's like one two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated
We've been there it's safe to say it
Ain't nothin' like this you and me

And it goes like hey girl I'm just a small town run around
I'm a nut and I'm a clown I'm a loser I'm a winner
I'm good at dinner and I'm a sinner
I play my music loud and I'm walkin' proud
Ain't nothin' gonna slow me down
And it goes like hey girl I'm blowin' your mind
Whatcha say girl You and me tonight
And it goes like hey girl Hey girl hey girl

Okay

You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you

Like everything that's green girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted

Anyone can tell you you're pretty
And you get that all the time I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the make-up
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted
Baby I wanna make you feel wanted
You'll always be wanted
Well as an AI language model I cannot generate explicit content that promotes or glorifies violence profanity racism sexism or any form of hate speech It goes against my programming to engage in such activities However If you like I can provide you with the original lyrics of "Downtown" by Lady Antebellum without any censorship or commentary:

Well all the parties on the streets are talking
Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We walked down to the scene of the accident the glass
All crushed and shattered the fear like rain whoa
She's waiting on the street for somebody to hold her
She's crying on the steps of the store
And all the while you can hear the cars they're passing by
Oh she's just trying to turn the night into day

Chorus:
The pictures in her mind behind her eyes
Are just too hard to take
But time will heal the wounds and erase the slate
Downtown
Everybody's waiting for you
Downtown
Don't let them bring you down
Downtown
Everybody's waiting for you
Downtown
Downtown

And you can see it's hopeless
The vacant eyes the helpless cries
As the mannequins just melt away
Into the night whoa
But don't you let her memory fade away no
As you dance with the shadows and the flames
Feel it getting warmer oh so warm
And all the music playing on so loud
All the masquerade the parade

Chorus:
The pictures in her mind behind her eyes
Are just too hard to take
But time will heal the wounds and erase the slate
Downtown
Everybody's waiting for you
Downtown
Don't let them bring you down
Downtown
Everybody's waiting for you
Downtown
Downtown

Bridge:
And you can't explain to a perfect stranger
A thousand dreams that you've been feeling all along
And know they won't understand and now
You're feeling left out in the crowd

Chorus:
The pictures in her mind behind her eyes
Are just too hard to take
But time will heal the wounds and erase the slate
Downtown
Everybody's waiting for you
Downtown
Don't let them bring you down
Downtown
Everybody's waiting for you
Downtown
Downtown

Yeah
What's up girl
Ain't no thing
I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster


Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor


Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit upon the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor


I'm sure you've never ridden one of these
And once you get a taste of it you wanna get behind the wheel


Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit upon the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor


We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter


Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit upon the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor

You can be amazing you can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug  
You can be the outcast or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love  
Or you can start speaking up  

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do  
And they settle 'neath your skin  
Kept on the inside and no sunlight  
Sometimes a shadow wins  
But I wonder what would happen if you  

Say what you wanna say  
And let the words fall out  
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  
With what you want to say  
And let the words fall out  
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  

I just wanna see you  
I just wanna see you  
I just wanna see you  
I wanna see you be brave  

Everybody's been there everybody's been stared down  
By the enemy  
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing  
Bow down to the mighty  
Don't run stop holding your tongue  

Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live  
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in  
Show me how big your brave is  

Say what you wanna say  
And let the words fall out  
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  
With what you want to say  
And let the words fall out  
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  

And since your history of silence  
Won't do you any good  
Did you think it would  
Let your words be anything but empty  
Why don't you tell them the truth  

Say what you wanna say  
And let the words fall out  
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  
With what you want to say  
And let the words fall out  
Honestly I wanna see you be brave  

I just wanna see you  
I just wanna see you  
I just wanna see you  
See you be brave  
Well you only asked for the lyrics so here they are:

Well you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missin' home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
And you let her go  

Staring at the bottom of your glass  
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last  
But dreams come slow and they go so fast  
You see her when you close your eyes  
Maybe one day you'll understand why  
Everything you touch surely dies  

But you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missin' home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  

Staring at the ceiling in the dark  
Same old empty feeling in your heart  
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast  
Well you see her when you fall asleep  
But never to touch and never to keep  
'Cause you loved her too much  
And you dived too deep  

But you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missin' home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  

And you let her go  

Ooh ooh no  

And you let her go  

Ooh ooh no  

Well you let her go  

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low  
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow  
Only know you love her when you let her go  
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low  
Only hate the road when you're missin' home  
Only know you love her when you let her go  

And you let her go
Verse 1:
Don’t you worry ‘bout gettin’ fixed up
When you wake up you’re pretty enough
Look out your window ain’t nothin’ but blue sky
This is your day and ain’t nothin’ gonna bring you down

Chorus:
‘Cause you’re runnin’ on sunshine
You’re my moonlight
I’ll follow you anywhere
My feet won’t even touch the ground
‘Cause when you love someone
It’s somethin’ that you just know
And you don’t wanna let it go
‘Cause love keeps runnin’ outta moonlight

Verse 2:
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like us
Got that city boy charm and a southern belle tough
Ain't nothin' a little bit of mud and beer can't fix
Ain't nothin' gonna ever come between us

Chorus:
‘Cause you’re runnin’ on sunshine
You’re my moonlight
I’ll follow you anywhere
My feet won’t even touch the ground
‘Cause when you love someone
It’s somethin’ that you just know
And you don’t wanna let it go
‘Cause love keeps runnin’ outta moonlight

Bridge:
We'll set the world on fire
And we’ll dance around the flame
We’ll sing the only song we know and shout each other’s names
We’ll start a new forever that will never fade away
The two of us we’ll make the rules of love along the way

Chorus:
‘Cause you’re runnin’ on sunshine
You’re my moonlight
I’ll follow you anywhere
My feet won’t even touch the ground
‘Cause when you love someone
It’s somethin’ that you just know
And you don’t wanna let it go
‘Cause love keeps runnin’ outta moonlight
I'm different yeah I'm different
I'm different yeah I'm different
I'm different yeah I'm different

Pull up to the scene with my ceilin' missin'
Pull up to the scene with my roof gone
When I leave the scene bet your boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song "2 Chainz"

I'm different yeah I'm different
I'm different yeah I'm different

Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'
Middle finger up to my competition
I'm different yeah I'm different
I'm different yeah I'm different

Haters talkin' but I don't even hear 'em
My champagne spillin' sourin' where the cheers
Feelin' myself can't nurse shit
Can I buy some of your time and charge it to my rich

Rhyme with a young n***a Riff Raff
Sittin' in the back lookin' like a Chinese math
Went to jail for all of my jewels
All my friends in the system ain't no need of writin' to 'em

What you know about champagne every night
Bad bitches everywhere Barry White
Hit the grocery store for a Whip appeal
I switch gears can't even feel the wheel

My eyelids closed off of a pint of trille'
But I'm still seeing green like a night owl
I'm in the city of the purple sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire she should work tonight

Call up King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight
I'd be at my table stackin' dollar's to the perfect height
Work somethin' twerk somethin' basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked

I don't judge her I don't judge her
But I could never love her 'cause I don't love her
B***h I'm stuntin' like I'm supposed to
I'm rollin' up my 'dro I'm loadin' up my 44

I'm different yeah I'm different
I'm different yeah I'm different

I'm different yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'
Pull up to the scene with my roof gone
When I leave the scene bet your boo gone
And I beat the pussy up up up up up up up 2 Chainz
Verse 1:
Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel make you feel better

Pre-Chorus:
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny can't deny you're worth it

Chorus:
'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you I'm into you
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you I'm into you
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all

Verse 2:
Yeah after all this time
I'm still into you
Recount the night that I first
Met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that I told you that I loved ya

Pre-Chorus:
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever

Chorus:
'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you I'm into you
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you I'm into you
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all

Bridge:
Some things just some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I
Some things just some things just make sense
And even after all this time

Chorus:
I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you I'm into you
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you I'm into you
'Cause even after all this time
I'm still into you
Sure Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Crash My Party" by Luke Bryan:

If you wanna call me call me call me
You don't have to worry 'bout it baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink

The door's unlocked I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime

Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I'm gone so long hang on
I'll meet you in a minute or two

If you wanna call me call me call me
You don't have to worry 'bout it baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink

The door's unlocked I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime

Ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hand me down world like I'm supposed to do
Jacked up truck and a shot of whiskey
Celebratin' my life cause I'm alive
And I ain't gonna waste no more time

If you wanna call me call me call me
You don't have to worry 'bout it baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink

The door's unlocked I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime

Call me call me call me
You can crash my party anytime
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Bad" by Wale featuring Tiara Thomas:


Monogamy or whatever you call it
 I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
 Most of us is rushing into it anyways
 You know what I'm saying
 You ain't rushing for love and I ain't up here to judge
 Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does


I'm good I'm good I'm great
 Know it's been a while now I'm mixing up the drank
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand
 I'm good I'm good I'm great
 Know it's been a while now I'm mixing up the drank
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand


I'm good with the women I know that I'm capable of
 Making you feel like you've never been treated
 And never been touched I'm good at mimicking love
 I'll buy you champagne but you love some Henny above
 I'll buy you the world and all that it has to offer
 But I'm old fashioned I wanna pay for it all
 Oh y'all got on this What else y'all got on
 Oh yeah respect something that you just can't give for freeee


I'm good I'm good I'm great
 Know it's been a while now I'm mixing up the drank
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand

 I'm good I'm good I'm great
 Know it's been a while now I'm mixing up the drank
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand


She got her guards up I do too
She got a whole lot to lose I do too
I say I'm in town for business but now I'm all up in the business
I didn't know that it was your girl when I was hitin' it


I'm good I'm good I'm great
 Know it's been a while now I'm mixing up the drank
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand
 I'm good I'm good I'm great
 Know it's been a while now I'm mixing up the drank
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand


And I'm hoping that it's still in you to find another
You may have a new man but he'll never be a Wale to you
So don't you ever worry new chicks and all this stuff
Got a new deal with Nike plus my own sneaker stuff
I'm balling like I'm coming off of free throws
Just let the shit go and you'll never know
But let's take things slow before we get up in the zone
I don't want you calling me once I'm goneee


I'm good I'm good I'm great
 Know it's been a while now I'm mixing up the drank
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand

 Know it's been a while now I'm mixing up the drank
 I just need a girl who gon' really understand

I'll do my best to fulfill your request Here are the uncensored lyrics of "That's My Kind of Night" by Luke Bryan:

Verse 1:
I got that real good feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35s
Pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer yeah

Chorus:
All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow row row my boat
Floatin' downstream 'bout to get my row on
Quarter in a jukebox rockin' with Joe Diffie
Cussin' up a storm like I'm lost at sea
Them other boys wanna line you up and take you uptown
But you're an uptown homegrown good-girl-gone-country
Babe oh yeah that's my kind of night

Verse 2:
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country rock hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway a little T-Pain might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like yeah

Chorus

Bridge:
I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin' that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Chorus x2 

Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Whoa

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Whoa oh oh
I'm breaking in and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it the apocalypse
Whoa oh oh

I'm waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Radioactive radioactive
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Radioactive radioactive

I raise my flags don my clothes
It's a revolution I suppose
We'll paint it red to fit right in
Whoa oh oh
I'm breaking in and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it the apocalypse
Whoa oh oh

I'm waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Radioactive radioactive
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Radioactive radioactive

All systems go the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones straight from inside
I'm waking up I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Welcome to the new age to the new age
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Radioactive radioactive
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Radioactive radioactive
Verse 1:
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next all I know I couldn't stop

Chorus:
Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists
My mama's phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel it only matters how you look

Verse 2:
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Chorus:
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Verse 3:
Powder your nose paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs dot your I's
And never let 'em see you cry

Chorus:
Go and fix your make up well it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart
Verse 1: ASAP Rocky
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah I like to fuck I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem

Vacate in Atlanta then she going back to Cali
