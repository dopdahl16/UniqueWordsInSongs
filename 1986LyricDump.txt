Say You Say Me by Lionel Richie lyrics:

Say you say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you say me
Say it together naturally

I had a dream
I had an awesome dream
People in the park
Playing games in the dark
And what they played
Was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt
A voice was crying out

Say you say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you say me
Say it together naturally

As we go down
Life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do
Is to find a friend or two
That helping hand
Someone who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got someone there to say
I'll show you

Say you say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you say me
Say it together naturally

So you think you know
The answers oh no
Well the whole world
Has got you dancing
That's right I'm telling you
It's time to start believing
Oh yes believing
Whoa aah

Say you say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you say me
Say it together naturally

Say it together naturally
Say it together naturally
Say it together naturally
Verse 1:
Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you
Then I realized that it was just my mind playing tricks on me
It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you

Chorus:
I miss you miss you
There's no other way to say it
And I and I can't deny it
I miss you miss you
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Verse 2:
Is it done and over this time
Have we really changed our minds oh baby
I haven't been able to sleep
Thinking about what we had deep inside
And I know it was wrong
But I thought about it did a lot of thinking last night
And something told me that it's not over that we can't let it die

Chorus:
I miss you miss you
There's no other way to say it
And I and I can't deny it
I miss you miss you
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Bridge:
I've got to gather my senses together
But my body's feeling weak felt so weak
I need the strength to pull through this somehow somehow
I've got to get up open the door now
To my heart cause I know it's waiting for you
And I'm sure yes I'm so sure that I miss you

Chorus:
I miss you miss you
There's no other way to say it
And I and I can't deny it
I miss you miss you
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Outro:
I miss you miss you
I miss you miss you
I miss you and me

So many times said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you


On my own on my own
On my own on my own


So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married


On my own on my own
On my own on my own


Once again I'm one
By myself alone
I'm just beginning
The grease has dried on the bones


On my own on my own
On my own on my own


So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married


On my own on my own
On my own on my own


On my own on my own
On my own on my own
Baby don't understand  
Why we can't just hold on to each other's hands  
This time might be the last I fear  
Unless I make it all too clear  
I need you so ohh

Take these broken wings  
And learn to fly again  
Learn to live so free  
And when we hear the voices sing  
The book of love will open up  
And let us in yeah yeah

Let us in   
Let us in   

Baby it's all I know  
That you're half of the flesh and blood  
Makes me whole  
I need you so  
So take these broken wings  
And learn to fly again  
Learn to live so free 
And when we hear the voices sing  
The book of love will open up  
And let us in yeah yeah

Let us in   
Let us in   

Let us in   
Let us in  

Oh ho ooh-hoo oh-ho oh-ho


She parties all the time party all the time
She parties all the time party all the time


I'm coming in the house she's lying on the couch
She said "Baby what's wrong" I said "Man please don't bounce"
She said "No one has to know what goes on behind closed doors"
But I don't tell a soul jumping around and they won't know


Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time


She takes me in her arms and squeezes me so tight
I'll never let her go no no no no
She knows how to party she knows how to party
Party all the time party all the time


Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time


Just send me in and it's party time
I'll bring in the crowd I'll be acting like a clown
If you need a party just call on me
We'll party till we drop ain't no stoppin' me


Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time
Party all the time party all the time


We like to party all the time
Party all the time party all the time

Two worlds collide
Rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes


Does the crowd understand
Is it East versus West
Or man against man
Can any nation stand alone
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst


In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
From the North and South
East and West
We burn for each other
Through the tireless unrest


Does the crowd understand
Is it East versus West
Or man against man
Can any nation stand alone
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst


After the storm
When the cold wind blows
How long will they last
The faith in their hearts
And the thoughts in their minds
Are the one that will last


Does the crowd understand
Is it East versus West
Or man against man
Can any nation stand alone
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
Kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison
Kyrie

The wind blows hard against this mountain side
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road

My heart is old it holds my memories
My body burns a gemlike flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

Kyrie eleison
Down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison
Through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison
Where I'm going will you follow
Kyrie eleison
On a highway in the light

When I was young I thought of growing old
Of what my life would mean to me
Would I have followed down my chosen road
Or only wished what I could be

Kyrie eleison
Down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison
Through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison
Where I'm going will you follow
Kyrie eleison
On a highway in the light

Kyrie eleison
Down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison
Through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison
Where I'm going will you follow
Kyrie eleison
On a highway in the light
Verse 1:
Mmmmm
I I'm just a stranger
In a world that's so unsure
Trying hard but you know we need so much more

Chorus:
Somehow I feel
I know we've been friends before
We're friends and lovers
Sharing life forever

Verse 2:
It's so hard to find a friend
Someone that you can depend on
With love and trust that will never end

Chorus:
Somehow I feel
I know we've been friends before
We're friends and lovers
Sharing life forever

Verse 3:
When you touch me I feel emotion
When you hold me I feel so alive
I can't help but love you
I can't help my love for you

Chorus:
Somehow I feel
I know we've been friends before
We're friends and lovers
Sharing life forever

Bridge:
We'll walk the road together
And make our love shine bright
We'll be friends and lovers
Going through life with you by my side

Chorus:
Somehow I feel
I know we've been friends before
We're friends and lovers
Sharing life forever

Outro:
Friends and lovers
Sharing life forever
Friends and lovers
Sharing life forever
Tonight it's very clear
As we're both lying here
There's so many things I want to say
I will always love you
I will never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't want to lose you
I could never make it alone

'Cause I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you're dreaming of
We'll live forever knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

You keep me standing tall
You help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone

'Cause I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you're dreaming of
We'll live forever knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

It's like a knight in shining armor
From a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away

'Cause I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that you're dreaming of
We're gonna live forever knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

We'll live forever knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police there's a madman around
Running down underground to a dive bar in a West End town
In a West End town a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
Too many shadows whispering voices
Faces on posters too many choices
If when why what
How much have you got
Have you got it Do you get it
If so how often
And which do you choose
A hard or soft option
How much do you need
In a West End town a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
West End girls
How much do you need
How much do you need
How much do you need
West End girls
How much do you need
I need them too
West End girls
How much do you need
Do you get it
How much do you need
Do you get it
West End girls
You turn me on you lift me up
And like the sweetest cup I'd share with you
You lift me up don't you ever stop I'm here with you
Now it's all or nothing 'cause you said you'd follow through
You followed me we were both alone but now we're cool
I don't wanna check out or fade away
And I don't wanna play safe
It's just that I want you to know
A love so strong it's got to show
Never fade away never fade away
Never fade away never fade away
Hold me love me hold me love me
Ain't got nothing but love babe eight days a week
Love you every minute every second
Love you everywhere I go love you always ain't no question
Love you every minute every second
Love you everywhere I go love you always ain't no question
Hold me love me hold me love me
Love me hold me love me hold me love me
Never fade away never fade away
Never fade away never fade away
Never fade away never fade away
Never fade away never fade away
Hold me love me never let me go
Hold me love me never let me go
Hold me love me hold me love me
Hold me love me hold me love me
Never fade away never fade away
Never fade away never fade away

Think about it there must be a higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it life is wasted time
Look inside your heart I'll look inside mine


Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world what is fair
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be


Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of


Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world what is fair
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be


Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love


I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along


Bring it oh higher
Bring it oh higher
Bring it oh higher
I could rise above on a higher love

There's a lady that I know
And she's just my type
She's the one I've been waiting for
Oh yeah
She's the fresh fresh freshiest
And she'll always be unless
She's the one I've been waiting for
Oh yeah


I'm so happy to have met you
I'm so happy that you're mine
We're two of a kind
You know that we're stuck with each other
Stuck like glue
You know we're stuck like glue
Stuck together


Well it's my manner that's casual
But it's my love that's high
She's got something that's special to me
And you know she's just right
And I gotta have her tight
I'm so happy that I met her
And I know she'll never let her
Go no


I'm so happy to have met you
I'm so happy that you're mine
We're two of a kind
You know that we're stuck with each other
Stuck like glue
You know we're stuck like glue
Stuck together


Like a double dutch bus in the middle of July
Stuck with each other and didn't bat an eye


I'm so happy to have met you
I'm so happy that you're mine
We're two of a kind
You know that we're stuck with each other
Stuck like glue
You know we're stuck like glue
Stuck together


I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you

You could have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back


All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need
You could have a big dipper
Going up and down all around the bends


You could have a bumper car bumping
This amusement never ends
I want to be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
Oh let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony yeah


You're showin' me you're showin' me the way to go

I want to be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
Oh let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony yeah yeah


I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it
Sledge sledge sledgehammer
I've kicked the habit kick the habit
Shed my skin shed my skin


This is the new stuff I go dancing in we go dancing in
Oh won't you show for me and I will show for you


Show for me and I will show for you


Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I do mean you
Only you you've been coming through
Imaginations they have nothin' on you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
Oh
Just to make you mine to be with you


I've crawled the desert on my hands and knees
Burning the tracks behind me
Oh bring me a higher love bring me a higher love
Oh


Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Why don't you call my name
Oh won't you call my name
I want to be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony

I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it
Verse 1:
Go now don't look back we've drawn the line
Move on it's no good to go back in time
I'll never find another girl like you for happy endings it takes two
We're fire and ice the dream won't come true

Chorus:
Sara Sara storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara Sara no time is a good time for goodbyes
Danger in the game when the stakes are high
Branded my heart was branded while my senses stood by

Verse 2:
I'll never find another girl like you for happy endings it takes two
We're fire and ice the dream won't come true
Sara Sara storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara Sara no time is a good time for goodbyes

Chorus:
Sara Sara storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara Sara no time is a good time for goodbyes
Danger in the game when the stakes are high
Branded my heart was branded while my senses stood by
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Can't Wait" by Nu Shooz:

Verse 1:
Joey had a girlfriend said she'd seen the world
Joey had a big house said he'd throw a party
Invited everybody Went to the store bought some caviar
But before they got there they saw the bikers
All the girls were scared - ha ha ha ha ha

Chorus:
I can't wait no I can't wait I can't wait until we're all alone
I can't wait no I can't wait I can't wait until we're all alone

Verse 2:
Joey called me up about a week ago
He said "Diane honey you know I love you true
You know that I love You"
But now he's gone and left me
For another girl beating all around the bush

Chorus:
I can't wait no I can't wait I can't wait until we're all alone
I can't wait no I can't wait I can't wait until we're all alone

Bridge:
Oh my love everlasting
Come and hold me
Oh my love everlasting
Come and hold me
I can't wait no I can't wait I can't wait until we're all alone

Chorus:
I can't wait no I can't wait I can't wait until we're all alone
I can't wait no I can't wait I can't wait until we're all alone

Outro:
I can't wait no I can't wait I can't wait until we're all alone
Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

Take my breath away
Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

My love take my breath away
My love take my breath away
My love take my breath away

But my friends keep telling me to give it up

Spare a little candle save some light for me
You're the only one who can make me see
My heart's a-cryin' these arms are dyin'
Every word sleighs me soothes me
All night long all night long

Your eyes kept me alive oh
You're the only one who knows why

Darkness settles on the ground
As I lay down my heart's poundin'
The room is so alive ooh
I hear your voice whispered in my mind

I feel your touch givin' me shivers
A night in your arms a fevered pitch oh
Everywhere I turn everythin' I see

The night though quiet holds so much promise

Hold me now hold me now
Till this hour has gone around
And I'm gone gone

These dreams it's all that I need
And I'm gone gone

Hold me now hold me now
Till the hurt is gone

These dreams it's all that I need
And I'm gone gone

These dreams it's all that I need
And I'm gone gone
They may run around
Catch the light
But if they ever get you down
Don't forget me when I'm gone

Don't forget me when I'm gone my heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take
You inside you you make my heart go
Oh you you have thrown me off the track
Again and again when I've needed you
So don't forget me when I'm gone
Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break without you

Lately I've been talking in my sleep
I'm surprised you've let me stay this long
This close to you
Don't forget me when I'm gone

Don't forget me when I'm gone my heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take
You you have thrown me off the track
Again and again when I've needed you
So don't forget me when I'm gone
Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break without you

I know that we we'll meet again
And sure as stars fall from above
And you you'll always be in my heart
So don't forget me don't forget me
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Don't forget me don't forget me
Don't forget me when I'm gone

Don't forget me when I'm gone my heart would break
I have loved you for so long it's all I can take
You inside you you make my heart go
Oh you you have thrown me off the track
Again and again when I've needed you
So don't forget me when I'm gone
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Troubled child
On a winter's night
For a long time
She pondered her fright
With tears in her eyes
She looked to the skies
And she whispered a prayer
Is someone there
'Cause it's cold and I'm lonely
Will I always feel this way
Lonely hearts oh they never mend
Lonely hearts oh they never mend
You must live to learn
You must live to learn
Before you love
Can find the courage to open your heart
And let somebody in
Before you know it
You're in too deep
And you're stranded
In the things that you keep
And now you're whole
And now you're home
But now your real life
Has begun
'Cause it's cold and I'm lonely
Will I always feel this way
Lonely hearts oh they never mend
Lonely hearts oh they never mend
You must live to learn
You must live to learn
Lonely hearts oh they never mend
Lonely hearts oh they never mend
You must live to learn
You must live to learn
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Mad About You" by Belinda Carlisle:

Walking on the shoreline
Watching the waves arrive
You are by my side
You are mine

Momentarily captured
Still enraptured
Touching the flame
Feeling feel again

It's crazy but true
All I can think of is you
All of those long lonely days
I finally found somebody who cares

Passionate play
Takes my breath away
What can I say
I'm mad about you

All of those old memories
Broken and so lonely
What can I do
I'm mad about you
Verse 1:
Been lying here on the floor where you left me
Counting the cracks in the wall
I've been turning my head to survive the madness
But love love is a lonely war

Chorus:
There's something about you that I can't let go
There's something about you that keeps me holding on
There's something about you I just don't know
I just don't know

Verse 2:
Been trying to find a reason for this aching
Every day feels the same
I've been staring for hours into the distance
But love love is a losing game

Chorus:
There's something about you that I can't let go
There's something about you that keeps me holding on
There's something about you I just don't know
I just don't know

Bridge:
Caught in the middle of this illusion
Caught in the middle of this dream
Are we just victims of confusion
Or are we both part of the scheme

Chorus:
There's something about you that I can't let go
There's something about you that keeps me holding on
There's something about you I just don't know
I just don't know

What is happening here
Something's going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the lights
We're gonna have a party it's starting tonight


Oh what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling


The room is hot that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people startin' to climb the walls
Ooh it looks like everybody's havin' a ball


Oh what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling


The word is out
That this is gonna be the night
They're gonna try to get us all hail with the beat
They're playing our favorite song gonna get our feet to move


Oh what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling


The room is hot that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people startin' to climb the walls
Ooh it looks like everybody's havin' a ball


Come on baby let's get onto the dance floor
Oh what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling


The room is hot that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people startin' to climb the walls
Ooh it looks like everybody's havin' a ball


What a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
What a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Come on shake your body baby
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on shake your body baby
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer

Come on shake your body baby
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tried it
Do the conga beat

Everbody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet

It's the rhythm of the island
And like the sugar cane so sweet
If you want to do the conga
You've got to listen to the beat

Come on shake your body baby
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tried it
Do the conga beat

Come on shake your body baby
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tried it
Do the conga beat

Feel the fire of desire
As you dance the night away
'Cause tonight we're gonna party
'Til we see the break of day

Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system
There's no way you're gonna stop

Come on shake your body baby
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tried it
Do the conga beat

Come on shake your body baby
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tried it
Do the conga beat

Come on come on let's go let's go
Do the conga

You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small


But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow


Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there


And I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow


Instrumental break


And I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow


Show me your true colors
Don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow

Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to beam of light I'd shine on my family
Said that I'm the one that you wanted to see
You said that I’m your dream and you’re ecstatic to be with me


What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah


I never asked for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth
I'm telling you no way
You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give


What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah


Used to go to dinner almost every night
Dancing till I thought I’d lose my breath
Now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death


What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah


Don't you remember what I told you
Don't you remember what I said
I said that you're gonna make me lonely
And you said "Hey babe I'll give you good times"
And now you want to come back in my life
But now that I have found someone new
You want me to take your sorry self back
But sorry buddy you had your chance

You can look into the lyrics of "No One Is to Blame" by Howard Jones as below:

You can look at the menu but you just can't eat
You can feel the cushion but you can't have a seat
You can dip your foot in the pool but you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment but you can't commit the sin

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her and she wants you
No one no one no one ever is to blame

You can build a mansion but you just can't live in it
You're the fastest runner but you're not allowed to win
Some break the rules and let you cut the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her and she wants you
No one no one no one ever is to blame

You can see the summit but you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her and she wants you
No one no one no one ever is to blame

If you leave don't leave now
Please don't take my heart away
Promise me just one more night

We've always had time on our sides

Every second every moment

**Verse 1:**

Not a word from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
A quick hit that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat stimulate my brain night is young
So are we let's just get to know each other slow and easily

**Chorus:**

Take my hand let's hit the floor
Shake our bodies to the music maybe then you'll score
So come on baby won't you show some class
Why you want to move so fast

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time oh no
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine uh huh

Shake our bodies to the music maybe then you'll score

Sure Here they are:

"All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying crying crying

And you
Don't know my tears
They don't know my fears
All cried out
All cried out

No more gas in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard nothing said
Can't even speak about it
Out out out of my head

'Cause boy your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Guess the verdict's in I'm crazy over you over you over you

I'm all cried out
All cried out
All cried out"
Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I want to say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night - we'll keep it under cover
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shaking
But something in my mind's not making sense
It's been awhile since we were all alone
But I can't hide the way I'm feeling

As you're leaving please would you close the door
And don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Mmm Hoo-hah
I can certainly provide the uncensored lyrics to "Perfect Way" by Scritti Politti:


You don't know how you met me
You don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
All you know is when I'm with you
I make you free
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea


I'm singing na na na
Na na na na Perfect way
Na na na na Perfect way
Na na na na Perfect way
Na na na na Perfect way


I'm feeling for you
I'm feeling for you
You don't know what it's like to be me
Looking for someone to need me
Looking for someone to feed me
I'm living on the edge of the possibility

I'm singing na na na
Na na na na Perfect way
Na na na na Perfect way
Na na na na Perfect way
Na na na na Perfect way


Let's not delay
Let's not delay

Na na na na Perfect way
Superhighways coast to coast easy to get anywhere
On the transcontinental overload just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel

When there's no destination-That's too far
And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are
Living in America eye to eye station to station
Living in America hand to hand across the nation
Living in America got to have a celebration
Rock my soul

Smokestack fatback many miles of railroad track
All-night radio keep on runnin' through your rock 'n' roll soul
All-night diners keep you 'wake hey on black coffee and a hard roll

You might have to walk the fine line you might take the hard line
But everybody's working overtime

Living in America eye to eye station to station
Living in America hand to hand across the nation
Living in America got to have a celebration
I live in America hey

I know what it means I thank you God for my home
In the United States of the good old US of A

Ah yeah
Steam heat and that's a fact
The pyramids right down the Nile
The Washington Monument and it's calling you and me yeah

The Liberty Bell draped with the stars and stripes
The upper Mississippi and the town of St Paul
And Niagara Falls it's a real sheer thrill
Niagara Falls you've got to see it to believe it

And Detroit City a-ha Motor City
The home of Motown yeah
The good old boys ah the boys down there in Muscle Shoals
And they sure know how to boogie and when they do
They drive their women wild yeah

And there's Boston and there's Boston a city that's tough
Hey Cleveland Detroit hey New York yeah
And there's Philadelphia and out in LA LA 

Living in America - hit me
Living in America - yeah I walk in and out
Living in America
I live in America - state lines gonna make the prime that

I live in America - hey
I know what it means I thank you God for my home
In the United States

Living in America - keep it going
Living in America - ABBREVIATION
Living in America - yeah yeah
Not black but white
You country bip I'm thanking of you all
Eye to eye station to station
Living in America
So nice with your bare self
Living in America
I feel good
Ain't that America home of the free
Little pink houses for you and me oh for you and me
Ain't that America the land of opportunity
There's a breathless hush on the freeway tonight
Beyond the ledges of concrete
Restaurants fall into dreams
With candlelight couples
Lost Alexandria still burns
In a billion lightbulbs
Lives cross lives
Idling car exhaust mixing
With quick ozone bursts
And cries of ecstasy
Against the feather soft night
With all its perfect sushi and identical
SUVs and every frozen
Evolutionary step
Takes us closer to God
And my knuckles are turning
To white with the thought
Of steering-wheel leather
Of fighting with traffic
And the idiots in BMWs
This is my mortal coil
This is America
Any girl can be a princess
Any boy can be a hero
Anybody can be President
And a bellyful of empty promises
Broken rules segregated schools
And the total unaccepted revolution of 1968
Butts in movie seats
And the lonely realization
That we're all in this together
And it's just life
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Who's Johnny" by El DeBarge:

There she goes and knows
I'm dying when she says "Who is Johnny"
Games with names that girl is playing
All she says is "Who is Johnny"
I try to understand
Because I'm people-man
I hear when she says "Who is Johnny"
I'll take her home let her cry on my shoulder
Make her feel that she's older
I'll console her cause I told her
I'd be here when it's over

There she goes again
With fishnets on and dreadlocks in her hair
She broke my heart
I wanna be sedated
All I do is sit and stare
Who can blame me when
I just can't see beyond her
I hear when she says "Who is Johnny"
Games with names that girl is playin'
I'll take her home let her cry on my shoulder
Make her feel that she's older
I'll console her cause I told her
I'd be here when it's over

I try to understand
Because I'm people-man
I hear when she says "Who is Johnny"

Oh here it comes that funny feelin' again winding me up inside
Every time we touch hey I don't know just tell me where to begin cuz I never ever
Felt so much


And I can recall any love at all baby this blows them all away

It's got what it takes so tell me why can't this be love
Straight from the heart oh tell me why can't this be love
I tell myself hey only fools rush in only time will tell if we stand the test of time
All I know you've got to run to win and I'll be damned if I'll get hung up on the line

Hey no I can't recall anything at all oh baby this blows them all away

It's got what it takes so tell me why can't this be love
You want it straight from the heart oh tell me why can't this be love


Ooh if we'd only trust in love and let it shine we'd be strong and free forever

Oh we've got what it takes oh we've got what it takes and I'll tell you why

Can't this be love 4x
He's not a man he's a lover and he knows just what he's doing
Making all the girls sigh and they know it's no surprise
He got the power oh he got the expertise
And he's always sure to please oh there's never a doubt 

He's a typical male mm-hmm
Always thinkin' of himself oh he's so vain
And that's just what I want to love him oh
Oh yeah look at him go
He's a typical male mm-hmm oh 

I'm the girl that's gonna have him no one else can take my place
He's a woman's own desire and they're fighting to the bone
Never knew another lover could ever be like dynamite
He's a lazy Casanova oh he's got the touch 

He's a typical male mm-hmm
Always thinkin' of himself oh he's so vain
And that's just what I want to love him oh
Oh yeah look at him go
He's a typical male mm-hmm oh 

Instrumental Break 

He's a typical 

He's a typical male mm-hmm
Always thinkin' of himself oh he's so vain
And that's just what I want to love him oh

And that's just what I want to love him oh

Jungle life I'm far away from nowhere
On my own like Tarzan Boy
Hide and seek I play along while rushing cross the forest
Monkey business on a sunny afternoon

Jungle life I'm living in the open
Native beat that carries on
Burning bright a fire blows the signal to the sky
I sit and wonder will the spell ever be broken

Hot like jungle where's your secret
I'm on a hunt for a mystery
Life can be oh so cliche woah
Love can be oh just like a dream

I'm Tarzan Boy jungle life
I'm Tarzan Boy jungle life
I'm Tarzan Boy jungle life

You couldn't get me to go away

But you couldn't see past my yesterday

All I need is a miracle
All I need is you

I have been searching for a fortune
That fame is destined to bring
I've been searching for a love
That would be heavenly
And I've been waiting for someone
Who's still searching for me

Chorus:
Sweet freedom
The shining light in your eyes
And you'll be free
To love me

Sweet freedom
The shining light in your eyes
And you'll be free
To love me

I've been searching for the daughter
Of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel
In white to avoid an evil spell
And I've been waiting for a woman
Who's soul is of the same kind as mine

Chorus

Get down

Guitar

Saxophone

Sweet freedom
The shining light in your eyes
And you'll be free
To love me

Sweet freedom
The shining light in your eyes
And you'll be free
To love me

Sweet freedom
The shining light in your eyes 2x

Sweet freedom
I'm talking about
Freedom
I'll take you to that
Freedom 2x
You're giving me a mystery to solve as "True Blue" is not a song known for having explicit or censored lyrics However here are the complete lyrics:

I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me baby this I know 'cause

True love or not true love
That is the question
Always on my mind
Is it love or am I just fooling myself
Tell me true what do you see
'Cause when I think I love you you're not sure of me

I've been around the world
Then I met you boy
It's like coming home
To a place I've known
Since you've been around
I've been lost in your sound
In your eyes I see
Forever more I see me
Through your love I see
Forever more I see me

True love or not true love
That is the question
Always on my mind
Is it love or am I just fooling myself
Tell me true what do you see
'Cause when I think I love you you're not sure of me
Tell me true what do you think
'Cause I'm never gonna leave you alone
Don't go away let me know if you're true true true
'Cause I'm never gonna leave you alone

True love or not true love
That is the question
Always on my mind
Is it love or am I just fooling myself
Tell me true what do you see
'Cause when I think I love you you're not sure of me
Tell me true what do you think
'Cause I'm never gonna leave you alone
True love or not true love
That is the question
Always on my mind
Is it love or am I just fooling myself
Tell me true what do you see
'Cause when I'm lost I can only think of you
Mmm mmm mmm
La la la la-la la la-la la la la la-la la la-la la la la la-la la la-la
Verse 1:
A Salvation Army band played
And the children drank lemonade
And the morning lasted all day
All day
And through an open window came
Like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away

Life in a Northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Ah hey-hey hey a-ha

He got down on one knee
Knee
And the whispers in the breeze
Said "Come on stop teasing"
Ah

Chorus:
Life in a Northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Ah hey-hey hey a-ha
Verse 3:
North country babe
Nothing I have seen
Or loved was close to you
With a country band
A rock and rollin' band
Ah
Gone city Angel
To be with you
To be with you
Ah
Chorus:
Life in a Northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Ah hey-hey hey a-ha
Life in a Northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma
Ah hey-hey hey a-ha

She taps her toes
She don't stop
She humming
She don't stop
Slightest twitch
Little hand
Her fingers
Itchin' to scratch a man's scalp
Smiling with a special glow
Pretending
Just pretending
She doesn't know
His name
His name oh no
He's easily led
By the lines of her designer leg
And with the nervousness
He tries to impress
But instead
He spills water
In his lap
Sliding down
Slow slow
She steals a kiss
And mutters
"Get out of my way"
She's turnin' on the lights
She's turnin' on the night
She's gotta make a play
She's gotta get it right
She's turnin' on the lights
She's turnin' on the night
She's gotta make a play
She's gotta get it right
She's turnin' on the lights
She's turnin' on the night
She's gotta make a play
She's gotta get it right
She's gotta smile
And make believe
That everything
Is absolute delight
But the girl's got a smile
That she's hiding
She's got plans
To make it right
So why don't you
Step on back
Cause she's coming
She's coming at you tonight
She's turnin' on the lights
She's turnin' on the night
She's gotta make a play
She's gotta get it right
She's turnin' on the lights
She's turnin' on the night
She's gotta make a play
She's gotta get it right
She's turnin' on the lights
She's turnin' on the night
She's gotta make a play
She's gotta get it right
You got the touch you got the power
Yeah you got the touch you got the power

You got the touch you got the power
Yeah you got the touch you got the power

Caught in the sudden attraction
Caught in the spell of a glance
It's a dangerous obsession
But I'm helpless in this trance

Oh I feel it really deep inside me
You light me up like a burning flame
I can't resist your tender power
I'm forever chained

Chorus:
Love touch one touch
I'm a prisoner of your love
Love touch one touch
I'm a victim of your touch

Just a glance just one glance
And I'm captured in your chains
Just one touch just one touch
And I'm a prisoner on love's terrain

Chorus

Oh I feel it really deep inside me
You light me up like a burning flame
I can't resist your tender power
I'm forever chained

Chorus x2
Need I say I love you 
Need I say I care 
Need I say that emotion's 
Something we don't share 
I don't want to be sitting here 
Trying to deceive you 

'Cause you know I know baby 
That I don't wanna go 

We cannot live together 
We cannot live apart 
That's the situation 
I've known it from the start 
Every time that I look at you 
I can see the future 

'Cause you know I know baby 
That I don't wanna go 

Throwing it all away 
Throwing it all away 
Is there nothing that I can say 
To make you change your mind 

I watch the world go round and round 
And see mine turning upside down 
You're throwing it all away 

Now who will light up the darkness 
Who will hold your hand 
Who will find you the answers 
When you don't understand 
Why should I have to be the one 
Who has to convince you 

'Cause you know I know baby 
That I don't wanna go 

Someday you'll be sorry 
Someday when you're free 
Memories will remind you 
That our love was meant to be 
Late at night when you call my name 
The only sound you'll hear 
Is the sound of your voice calling 
Calling after me 

Just throwing it all away 
Throwing it all away 
There's nothing I can say 
We're throwing it all away
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Baby Love" by Regina:


Baby love my baby love
I need you oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long


Cause baby love my baby love
Been missing ya miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay


Baby love my baby love
I need you oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long


I'm lonely and I'm blue

Need your lovin' need your lovin'
Need your lovin' need your lovin'"""

Hey Nikita is it cold
In your little corner of the world
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

Oh Nikita you will never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no Nikita you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me
Do you ever see the letters that I write
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

Oh Nikita you will never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no Nikita you'll never know

I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord oh Lord


Well if you told me you were drowning I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend but I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies


And I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment all my life oh Lord oh Lord


Well I remember I remember don't worry how could I ever forget 
It's the first time the last time we ever met 
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up no you don't fool me 
The hurt doesn't show but the pain still grows 
It's no stranger to you or me


And I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment all my life oh Lord oh Lord




And I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment all my life oh Lord


But I've been waiting for this moment all my life oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment all my life oh Lord oh Lord

Now there's a backseat lover that's always under cover
And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said you ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways
I met a cheerleader was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss like this


Walk this way Talk this way
Walk this way Talk this way


Just give me a kiss like this
Schoolgirl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knees
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
And I find myself when I'm thinkin' 'bout her
A-that's when the sweaty boys on the block were-a
Callin' cindy-anna-rella


Walk this way Talk this way
Walk this way Talk this way


She boppin' a cha-cha a-now she's up and back-a
She's movin' like she just don't care
Gonna take you by the hand take you by the hand
We're gonna go for a while

Walk this way Talk this way
Walk this way Talk this way
Walk this way Talk this way
Walk this way Talk this way
Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Reflected in your eyes
I wonder where you are
I wonder if you
Think about me

Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

Once the world was new
Our bodies felt the morning dew
That greets the brand new day
We couldn't tear ourselves away
I wonder if you care
I wonder if you still remember

Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

We'll keep the vow we made
To walk in the summer breeze
And dance in the flame
We're two shadows chasing rainbows
Behind the misty screens
That hide the coming day

Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Mirrored in your eyes
You smiled and we were free
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams
All right Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Spies Like Us" by Paul McCartney:

I don't need no military aid
Misappropriated or paid
I got mine from the CIA
I'm doing fine CIA
They're doing spy we spy too
Playing passive till we're through
Working undercover night and day
They're doing spy we spy too
Spies like us
I cannot disguise
Spies like us
Heaven knows
We may never return
Been holding out a long time
Holding out a long time
Been holding out a long time
We're heading for the borderline
Heading for the borderline
Been holding out a long time
Hold it
Standing in the garden
Watching the birds fly
Watching the clouds move
And the flowers grow

Sitting all alone
In the middle of the night
I can feel the breeze blow
I can feel the cold

And in the dreamtime
I wonder what you'll be
And in the dreamtime
You're always here with me

Walking in the desert
Feeling the sun beat down
Feeling the sand shift
Beneath my feet

Listening to the silence
Of a never-ending sky
I can feel the heat rise
I can feel the need

And in the dreamtime
I wonder where you'll go
And in the dreamtime
You're the only thing I know

But it seems
I'm always living in-between
All the places that I've been
All the things I thought I'd seen
But it's just a dream

And in the dreamtime
I wonder what you'll find
And in the dreamtime
You're the one who's always on my mind

And in the dreamtime
I wonder what you'll see
And in the dreamtime
You're the only one for me
Verse 1:
Sitting in the silence
Waiting for the sirens
Signs any signs I'm alive still
I don't wanna lose it
What if I'm already dead now
I don't wanna waste what's left hey

Pre-Chorus:
And I know I've been changing
I don't think I can take it no
It's got me feeling like I just wanna run away

Chorus:
You'll never know
The psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know
The murderer sitting next to you
You'll think "How'd I get here sitting next to you"
But after all I've said
Please don't forget

Verse 2:
All my friends are heathens take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Pre-Chorus:
And I know I've been changing
I don't think I can take it no
It's got me feeling like I just wanna run away

Chorus:
You'll never know
The psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know
The murderer sitting next to you
You'll think "How'd I get here sitting next to you"
But after all I've said
Please don't forget

Bridge:
Why'd you come You knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us

Chorus:
You'll never know
The psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know
The murderer sitting next to you
You'll think "How'd I get here sitting next to you"
But after all I've said
Please don't forget

Outro:
Watch it watch it
Watch it
Muted
Somebody's waiting for me  
It's been a long time  
A lot of seasons have passed me by  
I've been alright  
Lost in my shadows  
But don't you worry 'bout me  
I'm gonna make it alright  
Chorus:  
I'll be over you  
Somehow someday  
And I know that it's true  
It's gonna happen to you  
Please remember me  
When I'm gone  
You have to carry on  
It's a good advice  
To look your best  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the tunnel  
There's a light  
Somewhere somehow  
Chorus 2x  
spoken  
I'm gonna make you love me  
I'm gonna make you love me  
Oh yeah  
spoken  
I'll be over you  
I'll be over you  
I'll be over you  
Oh yeah  
Chorus until fade
There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above

Ooh I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming
Tell me is it really love

How will I know Don't trust your feelings
How will I know How will I know
Love can be deceiving

How will I know How will I know
If he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat

I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy - can't speak
Falling in love is so bittersweet

This love is strong why do I feel weak
My heart skips a beat
How will I know How will I know
Etc X7
I believe you may be referring to the original version of "The Greatest Love of All" by George Benson Here are the uncensored lyrics without any labels additional commentary censorship or information:

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Verse 1:
Here we are the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out it could mess up
Both our happy homes

Chorus:
I hate to think about us all meeting up together
As soon as I looked at you it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let them know no no no

Verse 2:
We can't leave each other we got to sneak around yeah yeah
To be with each other whenever we can
We know we got to be careful so don't let anybody find out
Too bad our love is a beautiful sin

Chorus:
I hate to think about us all meeting up together
As soon as I looked at you it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let them know no no no

Bridge:
We both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel is all so real
So we just got to let it show

Chorus:
I hate to think about us all meeting up together
As soon as I looked at you it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let them know no no no

Outro:
We can't leave each other
We got to live it like this
Got to keep it secret
Can't let nobody know how we're feeling
Got to keep it secret oh-oh-oh
Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had for so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone
Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to me the sooner or later
Holding back the years
Chance for me to escape from all I know
Holding back the tears
'Cause nothing here has grown
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could yeah
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on so tight
Well I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
'Cause nothing ever could oh
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
He's wasted all his tears
Wasted all those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
'Cause nothing ever could oh
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on x5
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Human" by The Human League:

Come on baby dry your eyes
Wipe your tears
Never like to see you cry
Won't you please forgive me
I wouldn't ever try to hurt you
I just needed someone to hold me
To fill the void while you were gone
To fill this space of emptiness

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
I'm only human
Born to make mistakes

So many nights I longed to hold you
So many times I looked and saw your face
Nothing could change the way I feel
No one else could ever take your place

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
I'm only human
Born to make mistakes

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
Darlin' you give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison you can't break free
Oh
You're a loaded gun yeah
Oh there's nowhere to run
No one can save me the damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood-red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Oh
You're a loaded gun
Oh there's nowhere to run
No one can save me the damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name
You give love a bad name

Shot through the heart

Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name


She's got it
Yeah baby she's got it
Well I'm your Venus
I'm your fire at your desire


Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love

Got what no one else had


Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

Listen to her howlin' roar 
Metal under tension
Beggin' you to touch and go 

Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone 
Headin' into twilight
Spreadin' out her wings tonight 
She got you jumpin' off the deck
And shovin' into overdrive 

Highway to the Danger Zone
I'll take you 
Right into the Danger Zone 

They never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload 
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go 

Out along the edge 
Is always where I burn to be 
The further on the edge 
The hotter the intensity 

Highway to the Danger Zone
Gonna take you 
Right into the Danger Zone 
Highway to the Danger Zone
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Words Get in the Way" by Miami Sound Machine:

We must be fools
We must be blind
To lose our hearts
And lose our minds
We must be strong
And see the signs
But every time I look into your eyes
All I see is you and me
And the way you're making me feel
So why should I pretend
Or try to fight it any longer
When I know yeah I know that it's true

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray

Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you baby
Let me love you
Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My "I don't have to run" day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an air-o-plane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My "I don't have to run" day
It's just another manic Monday

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
"C'mon honey let's go make some noise"
Time it goes so fast
When you're having fun

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My "I don't have to run" day
It's just another manic Monday
Verse 1:
I was at work uh
Ready to clock in uh
Heard my phone ring uh
And it was my boyfriend uh
We started talkin' uh
He sounded too excited uh
He said he was the one who uh
Dreamed what we did last night

Chorus:
I'm so I'm so nasty oh yeah
So so nasty oh yeah yeah
I'm so I'm so nasty oh yeah
So so nasty oh yeah yeah

Verse 2:
I hung up the phone uh
Felt guilty for feelin' uh
So good so wet uh
The way that he put it down
So I changed my clothes uh
I went to his house uh
Walked in he whispered uh
"You look like a nasty girl"

Chorus:
I'm so I'm so nasty oh yeah
So so nasty oh yeah yeah
I'm so I'm so nasty oh yeah
So so nasty oh yeah yeah

Chorus:
I'm so I'm so nasty oh yeah
So so nasty oh yeah yeah
I'm so I'm so nasty oh yeah
So so nasty oh yeah yeah
Take the children and yourself
And hide out in the cellar
By now the fighting will be close at hand
Don't believe the church and state
And everything they tell you
Believe in me I'm with the high command

Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
There's a gun and ammunition
Just inside the doorway
Use it only in emergency
Better you should pray to God
The Father and the Spirit
Will guide you and protect from up here

Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Swear allegiance to the flag
Whatever flag they offer
Never hint at what you really feel
Teach the children quietly
For some day sons and daughters
Will rise up and fight while we stand still

Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Reach for your word
Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Throw me a lifeline
Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Reach for your word
Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Throw me a lifeline
Can ya hear me can ya hear me running
Verse 1:
How do rumors get started
They're started by the jealous people and
They get mad seeing something they had and
Someone else is holding
They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
But these wicked women ooh they just persist

Chorus:
Maybe you think it's cute but girl I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business please don't mess
Don't want no gossip in my family tree
Don't need no thin line 'cause it's all right with me

Verse 2:
People will gossip on a man who they see alone
Woman rubbers since the beginning of time I suppose
The moral of the story is make sure the price is right
If the price is right I will make my night
Excuse me but I need a mouthwash
Don't mean to be bold but I gotta let you know
I gotta thing for your girlfriend whoa

Chorus:
Maybe you think it's cute but girl I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business please don't mess
Don't want no gossip in my family tree
Don't need no thin line 'cause it's all right with me

Outro:
Don't want no rumors don't like gossip won't be no clown

Verse 1:
Baby baby
I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet

Leaving me alone and hurt
Think it over After I've been good to you
Think it over After I've been sweet to you

Music ends
And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Well you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you

Oh and then for the times when we're apart
Well then close your eyes and know
That words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
In good times in bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Keep smiling keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for
Your lights are on but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't sleep you can't eat
There's no doubt you're in deep
Your throat is tight you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

Whoa you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it you're addicted to love

You see the signs but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine a one-track mind
You can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do

Whoa you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it you're addicted to love

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Sleeping Bag" by ZZ Top:

When it's cold outside and you want to sleep in
Go for a pallet that's so nice and thin
Zip it on around while it's on the ground
Spread it out and lay it on down

Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag

You're afraid of the dark baby no need to be
The world is yours for you to see
Don't worry about a thing baby don't you fret
We're gonna find a way to outsmart the rest

Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag

Let's go out to Egypt 'cause it's in the plan
Sleep beside the pharaohs in the shifting sand
We'll look at some pyramids and check out some heads
Oh we'll whip up a soufflé and carry on ahead

Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag

The moment of truth is right at hand
Just park your car in a no-parking zone
And if the cops try to bust you just give 'em a bribe
Slip inside my sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag

Sleeping bag sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag
Sleeping bag sleeping bag
Slip inside my sleeping bag
  
Here I lay all alone  
Tossin' turning  
Longing for some of your  
Tender love

To come so I can thank you for  
All the tender love you've given to me  

  
Tender love

Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics of "King for a Day" by Thompson Twins:

Verse 1:
I took a holiday
I was just walking down the street
When I saw him
He was dancing to a different beat
I waved my flag
And shouted loud
But he just turned away

Chorus:
I'm king for a day
I can do anything
I'm king for a day
I can do anything

Verse 2:
I left my worries behind
And nothing bothered me
I felt complete
I was living life carefree
I raised my hands
Up to the sky
And let my spirit fly

Chorus:
I'm king for a day
I can do anything
I'm king for a day
I can do anything

Bridge:
And I know that it can't last forever
But it doesn't matter anyway
I'll take this feeling with me forever
And use it whenever I'm feeling betrayed

Chorus:
I'm king for a day
I can do anything
I'm king for a day
I can do anything

Outro:
I'm king for a day
I'm king for a day
I'm king for a day
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Go Home" by Stevie Wonder:

Verse 1:
Soon you'll be outside
You'll be laughing heartily
And I'll sit here inside
Sipping my chamomile tea
But it really don't matter much
To me
When you're gone
I'm gonna sit right here and sing my song

Chorus:
Go home
Go home
Won't you please go home
Let's call it a day
'Cause they've taken your laugh away

Verse 2:
I remember in the old days
When you would stand and shout
But now you're dry as the desert
And I can't figure it out
But it really don't matter much to me
When you're gone
I'm gonna sit right here and sing my song

Chorus:
Go home
Go home
Won't you please go home
Let's call it a day
'Cause they've taken your laugh away

Bridge:
I've got all the time in the world to wait for you
I'm not gonna stand in your way
I'm gonna see you through
So go on
Go on
Go on
Don't say I didn't warn you
Go on
Go on
Go on
Don't say I didn't warn you

Chorus:
Go home
Go home
Won't you please go home
Let's call it a day
'Cause they've taken your laugh away

Outro:
Go home go home
Go home go home
Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes\
When I'm standing beside you\
There's a fever burning deep inside\
Is there another in your memory\
Do you think of that someone\
When you hear that special melody\
I always stop and think of you especially\
When the words of love come softly as in summer breeze\
I remember all the good times we shared together\
The promises we made still hold a flame\
How could you forget all these things\
There'll be sad songs to make you cry\
Love songs often do\
They can touch the heart of someone new\
Saying I love you I love you\
I often wonder how it could be\
You loving me two hearts in perfect harmony\
I'll count my blessings every day\
I'll cherish them along the way\
'Coz I know coz I know you'll be there\
Whenever I need you to comfort me\
You say you love me and I believe you will\
But you must know that my heart needs a commitment\
And it's your heart that I want\
Baby it's your heart I need\
There'll be sad songs to make you cry\
Love songs often do\
They can touch the heart of someone new\
Saying I love you I love you\
How I love you I love you
Oh no worries Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Word Up" by Cameo:

Verse 1
Yo pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother your sister and your mama too
'Cause we're about to throw down and you'll know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance do your dance do your dance quick mama
Come on baby tell me what's the word 

Chorus
Word up Up up 
Everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Word up Up up 
It's the code word 
No matter where you say it you'll know that you'll be heard 

Verse 2
Now all you sucker DJs who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you've got to realize that you're acting like fools
If there's music we can use it we need to dance
We don't have time for psychological romance
No romance no romance no romance for me mama
Come on baby tell me what's the word 

Chorus
Word up Up up 
Everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Word up Up up 
It's the code word 
No matter where you say it you'll know that you'll be heard 

Bridge
Say wait a minute now check it out
Come on while I wreck it out
I'm gonna say it again 
Word up Up up 
Everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Dial L for low
Word up 
Come on all you people say 
Word up Up up 
It's the code word 
No matter where you say it you'll know that you'll be heard 

Chorus x2
Word up Up up 
Everybody say 
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway 
Word up Up up 
It's the code word 
No matter where you say it you'll know that you'll be heard
In the clear blue waters
Where the sharks feed
Eyeing up their next prey
They don't see me
I'm way ahead of the game
Running faster
I'm living election day
Doing it my way yeah
Living it my way yeah
Doing it my way yeah
Living it my way
In the streets and the gutters
Where the talk is cheap
Some are looking for a saviour
Others looking for a way
Shake your grip on wire
Cause it won't last
I'm living election day
Doing it my way yeah
Living it my way yeah
Doing it my way yeah
Living it my way
Press-ganged fools on the bandwagon
Gutless nothing's gained
Empty words of a businessmen
Latent lepers dirty whores
Cynical they come
priceless and controlled
Living in a box
Three feet thick
So beautiful and damned
Celebrate the irony
Everything is going wrong
But we're so happy
Come to terms with entropy
To the sound of a beat
Happy feet dance with me
Schematic systematic
Impact philosophic
Frequency democratic
I'm breathing it in
Breathing it in
Living it my way yeah
Doing it my way yeah
Living it my way yeah
Doing it my way yeah

Don't you ever go away it'll always be this way
I'm so scared of this place
And the people in it
And what they could do to you
They could hurt you badly
And you don't seem to worry
Half as much as you should

I won't always be around
When you're on your own

I'll know if you're lying
I'll know if you're wasting time
I know you better than you think
I know baby that you're mine

When you're kissing your lipstick
I mean somebody else's
Does the lie fall asleep
On the way to your heart

Sorrow's my body on the waves
Sorrow's the girl with the pearl
It's always been my head I've been saving
For a different corner and we'll start

Please don't ask me for directions
I don't know where I'm going
And you don't know where we've been
But I look at you and smile

Now I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry
I don't wanna let you go tonight I just wanna love you till the morning light
Take me home tonight
I don't wanna let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey just like Ronnie sang be my little baby
I wanna take you home I won't do you wrong
I wanna love you till the cows come home
Take me home tonight
Listen I see a red light and I want it painted black
No colours anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
Take me home tonight
I don't wanna let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Be my little baby
Oh oh oh take me home tonight
I just wanna show you what true love can do
So just take me home tonight
I swear I'll make it worth your while
Take me home tonight
Listen honey just like Ronnie sang be my little baby
I wanna take you home I won't do you wrong
I wanna love you till the cows come home
Take me home tonight
I don't wanna let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Baby my darlin'
Oh oh oh I feel a hunger it's a hunger
Take me home tonight
I'll drive you home tonight
I swear to your mama I'll do it right
Oh oh oh take me home tonight
Listen honey just like Ronnie sang be my little baby
I wanna take you home I won't do you wrong
I wanna love you till the cows come home
Oh oh oh take me home tonight
Oh oh oh take me home tonight
