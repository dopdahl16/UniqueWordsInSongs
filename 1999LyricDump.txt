After love after love
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
Takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one


Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough no


What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
Well I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you


Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough no


But I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore oh
I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore
No I don't need you anymore


Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough no


Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough no
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough no
Do you believe in life after love after love after love

Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silvermoon's sparkling
So kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken treehouse
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring bring bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
Oh kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silvermoon's sparkling
So kiss me

Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silvermoon's sparkling
So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
I feel like I have to clarify that the uncensored lyrics of "Genie in a Bottle" by Christina Aguilera contain some mature themes Here are the uncensored lyrics:

I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby baby baby baby baby baby

Oh whoa my body's saying let's go
Oh whoa but my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me baby
There's a price you gotta pay
I'm a genie in a bottle I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free baby and I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come come come on and let me out

The music's fading the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby baby baby baby baby baby

Oh whoa my body's saying let's go
Oh whoa but my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me baby
There's a price you gotta pay

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Every Morning" by Sugar Ray:

Every morning there's a halo hangin' 
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed 
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for the weekend 
Or a one-night stand 
Couldn't understand how to work it out 
Once again as predicted left my broken heart open 
And you ripped it out 
Something's got me reeling 
Stopped me from believing 
Turned me around again 
Said that we can do it 
You know I want to do it again 
Shadows lurk ghosts must haunt 
But I don't wanna know if you're hauntin' me 
Don't let it get away 
Every morning there's a halo hangin' 
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed 
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for the weekend 
Or a one-night stand 
Couldn't understand how to work it out 
Once again as predicted left my broken heart open 
And you ripped it out 
Something's got me reeling 
Stopped me from believing 
Turned me around again 
Said we can do it 
You know I want to do it again 
Every day is a new day 
I'm thankful for every breath I take 
I won't take it for granted 
So I learn from my mistakes 
It's beyond my control 
Sometimes it's best to let go **** it away 
Someday's it doesn't matter that I pack it up and leave those thoughts behind 
Every morning there's a halo hangin' 
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed 
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for the weekend 
Or a one-night stand 
Couldn't understand how to work it out 
Once again as predicted left my broken heart open 
And you ripped it out 
Something's got me reeling 
Stopped me from believing 
Turned me around again 
Said we can do it 
You know I want to do it again 
Every morning every morning every morning won't you wake up 
Every morning every morning every morning won't you wake up
How did you get here

Nobody's supposed to be here

I've tried that love thing for the last time

My heart says no no

Nobody's supposed to be here

But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life on a search to find

The love who'll stay for eternity

The heaven sent to fulfill my needs

But when I turn around

Again love has knocked me down oh

My heart got broken falling deep

Somebody tell me what

Is this supposed to be the real thing

Or just a cruel hoax and a mistake

Nobody's supposed to be here

But you came along and changed my mind

I've tried to go on and forget you

But without success I suppose

'Cause everytime I close my eyes

I see your face and realize

Nobody's supposed to be here

But you came along and changed my mind



No no no no no no

No no no no no no

Nobody's supposed to be here

Nobody's supposed to be here

But you came along and changed my mind

I I I I I I

Nobody's supposed to be here

But you came along and changed my mind

I I I I I I

Nobody's supposed to be here

But you came along and changed my mind

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Slide" by Goo Goo Dolls:

Could you whisper in my ear
The things you wanna feel
I'd give you anything
To feel it comin'

Do you wake up on your own
And wonder where you are
You live with all your faults
I wanna wake up where you are

I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
Yeah I'm gonna let it slide

Don't you love the life you killed
The priest is on the phone
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you
Don't supposed I'll ever know
What it means to be a man
It's somethin' I can't change
I'll live around it

I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
You're a little piece of heaven
You're a golden ray of light
I said heaven right to your head
So why don't you slide


Where there's nowhere left to hide
Let's put our heads together
And we'll glide
I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
Oh slide oh slide oh slide
Verse 1:
Have you ever loved somebody so much
It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad
You can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever have you ever

Chorus:
Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything to make them understand
Have you ever had someone steal your heart away
You'd give anything to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start

Verse 2:

To make you understand how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world

Yeah here are the uncensored lyrics to "I Want It That Way" by Backstreet Boys:

Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire
Your one desire
Yes I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a mistake Don't wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say
Never wanna hear you say it
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I never wanna hear you say it
I want it that way

Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake

No problem Here are the uncensored lyrics of "I'm Your Angel" by R Kelly and Celine Dion:


No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith oh yeah
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray


And then you will see the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see


I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone I'm here
No matter how far you are I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel


I saw your tear drops and I've heard you cry
All you need is time seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It doesn't have to be this way let me show you a better day


And then you will see the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see


I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone I'm here
No matter how far you are I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel


And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep up safe and warm
And I know we will survive
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the skies


I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone I'm here
No matter how far you are I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel


I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone I'm here
No matter how far you are I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're an all-star get your game on go play
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how 'bout yours
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey now you're an all-star get your game on go play
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now you're an all-star get your game on go play
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said "Yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change"

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're an all-star get your game on go play
Hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason to feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day


I need some distraction or a beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight


In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here


So tired of the straight line and everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting you keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack


It don't make no difference escape one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees


In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here


You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove yeah

And if you said "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart make it real or else forget about it

But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out out

Well out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And if you said "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart make it real or else forget about it

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart make it real or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Give me your heart make it real
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week
You triflin' good for nothing type of brother
Silly me why haven't I found another
A baller when times get hard
I need someone to bail me out instead of
Someone to point a finger at me
And help me out help me out
I wouldn't mind if you had things
Going well for yourself but you
Don't have nothin' and you're
Nothin' tryin' to be something
Cause you're just frontin' just frontin'
Said you're just frontin' just frontin'
Said you're just frontin' just frontin'
Now you call me at work
You're cryin' for me to come back home
But I ain't got time for this
About to miss my overtime
I really don't have time to waste
Gotta make that paper
Keep on paying your rent
Keep on paying your car
Keep on paying your telephone bill
Keep on paying your auto bills
If you did it in the past
Future tense will be: “I'll never do it again”
Oh yeah you triflin' good for nothing type of brother
Silly me why haven't I found another
A baller when times get hard
I need someone to bail me out instead of
Someone to point a finger at me
And help me out help me out
I wouldn't mind if you had things
Going well for yourself but you
Don't have nothin' and you're
Nothin' tryin' to be something
Cause you're just frontin' just frontin'
Said you're just frontin' just frontin'
Said you're just frontin' just frontin'
Pay my own fun oh
And I pay my own bills
Always fifty fifty in relationships
The shoes on my feet I've bought it
The clothes I'm wearing I've bought it
The rock I'm rockin' I've bought it
'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearing I've bought it
The house I live in I've bought it
The car I'm driving I've bought it
I depend on me I depend on me
All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me
Go on and close the curtains
'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me and a bottle of wine
And I'll hold you tonight

Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
And let's delay our misery

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away it's true

It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darling please don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go oh
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow tomorrow I'll be gone

Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I that I could stay
But girl you know I've got to go oh
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow tomorrow I'll be gone

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow tomorrow I'll be gone
Oh where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road up straight ahead
A car was stalled the engine was dead
I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last
Oh where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
When I woke up the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm flowed through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head she looked at me and said
"Hold me darling just a little while"
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I had missed
But now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life that night
Oh where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
Listen girl
Don't you see what you mean to me
Get deep in my heart
Put your mind at ease
Chorus:
Let it all out
I'm here for you yeah yeah
It's alright
Cuz that's what I'm here for
Don't go in circles
When time's on your side
We stand together
Our love is alive
Chorus:
Tell me what you need from me
I'm not gonna make a fool of myself
I have some understanding
I'm here for you
Chorus:
I've been waiting
I've been waiting

Note: This is the uncensored version of the lyrics

Este amor sobrenatural
Este amor que pudo cambiar
Todo mi mundo de ayer
Fue un instinto animal


Nos vamos escapando
En la noche dos locos
Dejando atrás el dolor


Bailamos
Let the rhythm take you over
Bailamos
Te quiero amor mío
Bailamos
Wanna live this night forever
Bailamos
Te quiero amor mío
Te quiero


Tonight I'm yours
We can make it happen
I'm so sure
I won't let it go
Lo que siento así es verdad
This feeling inside


Nos vamos escapando
En la noche dos locos
Dejando atrás el dolor


Bailamos
Let the rhythm take you over
Bailamos
Te quiero amor mío

Wanna live this night forever

Verse 1:
We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty dreadlocked and full of mange
He asks a man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
"Get a job you f*****g slob"'s all he replies

Chorus:
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
'Cause then you might know what it's like to sing the blues
Then you might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you might know what it's like to have to lose

Verse 2:
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
He said "Don't worry about a thing baby doll I'm the man you've been dreamin' of"
But three months later he say he won't date her or return her calls
And she swear "God damn if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls"

Chorus:
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
Then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you really might know what it's like oh

Verse 3:
I've seen a rich man beg
I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad
And the downside of up
And everything between

Chorus:
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in my shoes
'Cause then you might know what it's like to have to choose
Then you might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you might know what it's like to have to lose

Outro:
Musical interlude
I wish that I could fly
Into the sky
So very high
Just like a dragonfly

I'd fly above the trees
Over the seas in all degrees
To anywhere I please

Oh I want to get away
I want to fly away
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh I want to get away
I want to fly away
Yeah yeah yeah

Let's go and see the stars
The Milky Way or even Mars
Where it could just be ours

Let's fade into the sun
Let your spirit fly
Where we are one
Just for a little fun

Oh I want to get away
I want to fly away
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh I want to get away

Verse 1:
I'm out the door not a flaw
Don't need nothing more
I'm kissing ass and taking names
I'm on a roll I'm  in control
Need someone to save me now
'Cause I know I'm going down

Chorus:
I know you want it but you're never gonna get it
I'm on a roll and I'm never gonna quit it
Someday I will find you break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you how we touched and went our separate ways

Verse 2:
If you think I'm gonna wait this time
You've got another thing comin'
I'm no fool and I'm not a kid
You're still the same and I'm oh so fed up
Don't need your love now I know the score
You never played me quite like this before

Chorus:
I know you want it but you're never gonna get it
I'm on a roll and I'm never gonna quit it
Someday I will find you break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you how we touched and went our separate ways

Bridge:
I'm outta luck outta love
Got a photograph picture of
Passion killer you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch
I see your face every time I dream
On every page every magazine
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want my fantasy

Chorus:
I know you want it but you're never gonna get it
I'm on a roll and I'm never gonna quit it
Someday I will find you break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you how we touched and went our separate ways

I see Here are the uncensored lyrics of "That Don't Impress Me Much" by Shania Twain:

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original a know-it-all

Oh-oo-oh you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh you think you're something else

Okay so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oo-oh so you think you're something special
Oh-oo-oh you think you're something else

Okay so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much
So you got the looks but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car goodnight
C'mon baby tell me you must be jokin' right

Oh-oo-oh you think you're something special
Oh-oo-oh you think you're something else

Okay so you've got a car
That don't impress me much
So you got the moves but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much

You think you're cool but have you got the touch
You think you're cool but have you got the touch
You think you're cool but have you got the touch
That don't impress me much

Oh-oo-oh you think you're something special
Oh-oo-oh you think you're something else

So you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains but have you got the touch

Verse 2:
Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

I still believe someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Hardest Thing" by 98 Degrees:

We both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong
And baby it's killing me it's killing you
Both of us trying to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusted me fast asleep

I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry

I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away
Pretending I don't love you
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer since that summer
Hip-hop Marmalade spic And span
Met you one summer and it all began
You're the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird Jersey 33
When you take a sip you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle cause I can't speak baby
Something in your eyes went and drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer then went back home
Macauly Culkin wasn't Home Alone
Fell deep in love but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer since that summer
Cherry Pez Cold Crush Rock Star Boogie
Used to hate school so I had to play hookie
Bob Marley homie Stevie Wonder

Catch me on the rebound got 'em goin' crazy

I'll race you to the beach car I'll let you drive it
A little Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince just to vibe with

Yo tengo Fifty-One anos cinco uno
Girl you're my sunshine Coca-Cola sign
And I just love your sushi roll hotter than wasabi
I race for your love shake and bake Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen'em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear you need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl I thought I recognized her
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer for the summer

I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer since that summer

Momma please stop crying
I can't stand the sound
Your pain is painful and its tearin' me down
I hear glasses breaking as I sit up in my bed
I told dad you didn't mean those nasty things you
said
You fight about money bout me and my brother
And this I come home to this is my shelter
It ain't easy growin' up in World War III
Never knowin' what love could be you'll see
I don't want to be the one who's battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fightin' for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breakin' the habit
I'm breakin' the habit tonight
Clasping my hand behind my neck
I pace around the room
Knowing this is it
If I make the move you're gonna groove
Gonna take much more than a twenty-two
Can't afford to lose when she's worth more
Sleeping on my side
I dreamt she was beside me
My love my life
Somewhere behind me
I can't believe
I've had to leave
But her will to want will to breathe
One by one ticking time bombs won't delay
And I pray you're never gonna feel this way
Boom boom boom
Clasping my hand behind my neck
I pace around the room
Knowing this is it
If I make the move you're gonna groove
Gonna take much more than a twenty-two
Can't afford to lose when she's worth more
Won't see her again
Her eyes her eyes
Used to love her but I had to kill her
Won't see her again
Her eyes her eyes
Used to love her but I had to kill her
Doo doo doo
Don't you
Don't you
Don't you take it away from me
Don't you take it away from me
Now x6
Doo doo doo
Don't you take it away from me
Don't you take it away from me
Don't you take it away from me
Now x6

Chorus:
It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins
You act like you ain't hear him but give him a little trim
To begin how you think you're really gonna pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then then you probably f*ck again

Verse 3:
Talking out your neck saying you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hardrock when you really are a gem

Verse 4:
Baby girl respect is just a minimum
N***** F*cked Up and y'all still defending them
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn
It's silly when girls sell their soul because it's in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

Chorus:
It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Franklin's
You act like you ain't hear him but give him a little trim
To begin how you think you're really gonna pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then then you probably f*ck again

Verse 5:
I'm sick and tired of the mess you keep drivin'
When you really ought to know it's just survivin'
If you really think the glory's gon' come with dyin'
People gon' die but don't ask me how or why
No ma'am nah your value's not determined
By the one who don't love you the one who don't want you
The most these days is just illusions
Bombs bursting in air oh say can you see whoooah

Chorus:
It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let hit and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamin's
You act like you ain't hear him but give him a little trim
To begin how you think you're really gonna pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then then you probably f*ck again
Ladies and gentlemen this is Mambo No 5

One two three four five
Everybody in the car so come on let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna
Beer bust like I had last week
I must stay deep 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela Pamela Sandra and Rita
And-as I continue you know they're getting sweeter
So what can I do I really beg you my Lord
To me flirting is just like a sport
Anything fly it's all good let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Mambo No 5
Verse 1:
I can remember on a warm summer's night
You were the only one who made things right
We didn't know each other and we didn't think twice no
The way you walked the way you talked the way you looked was nice

Chorus:
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me

Verse 2:
Now any other day I would play it cool
But I can't now cause I want you
See I'm hooked on how you flex your style
And I wanna talk for a little while
I never really seen your type before
But I must admit I kinda like it though
So let's hop a plane and we can go
Back to the days when love was real oh

Chorus:
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me

Bridge:
Some say love is pain and that's a doubt
And it's a risk that we all take
In hopes of finding someone who
Will make us whole and take our breath away

Chorus:
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me

Outro:
Sweet lady hey lady
Would you be my sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me sweet lady
Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out but you came home around three
If six of y'all went out then four of you were really cheap yeah
'Cause only two of you had dinner I found your credit card receipt
It's not right but it's okay I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy yeah
Thursday night you called me on the phone
We were both alone yeah
You sounded upset but then the line went dead
I tried to call back but you didn't answer
It's not right but it's okay I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I pack your bags so you can leave town for a week
The phone rings and then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends down on 54th and
All of them playa haters as they call it

Sure Here are the uncensored lyrics of "God Must Have Spent A Little More Time on You" by NSYNC:


Can this be true Tell me can this be real 
How can I put into words what I feel 
My life was complete I thought I was whole 
Why do I feel like I'm losing control 
I never thought that love could feel like this 
Then you changed my world with just one kiss 


How can it be that right here with me 
There's an angel It's a miracle 
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep 
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep 
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true 
God must have spent a little more time on you 


On you on you on you you you 
A little more time yes he did baby 
In all of creation all things great and small 
You are the one that surpasses them all 
More precious than any diamond or pearl 
They broke the mold when you came in this world 
And I'm trying hard to figure out why 
You're the one that I want for the rest of my life 


How can it be that right here with me 
There's an angel It's a miracle 
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep 
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep 
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true 
God must have spent a little more time on you 


Oh on you on you on you you you 
Oh yes he did yeah 
A little more time on you 


How can it be that right here with me 
There's an angel It's a miracle 
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep 
Your soul is like a secret I never could keep

God must have spent a little more time on you 


On you on you on you you you

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Lullaby" by Shawn Mullins:

She grew up with the children of the stars
In the Hollywood hills and the boulevards
Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there they hung out with folks like
Dennis Hopper Bob Seger Sonny and Cher

She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage I can tell that
She can't let go and she can't relax

And just before she hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby I sing

Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye

Rockabye rockabye

She still lives with her mom outside of the city
Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her
She's so pretty but she'd be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while

'Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town

But everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye

Rockabye rockabye

I told her I ain't so sure about this place
It's hard to play a gig in this town and keep a straight face
Seems like everybody's got a plan
It's kind of like Nashville with a tan but everything's
Gonna be all right I have a Beamer and my dreams
And I still have love in my life

And love's a pretty good antidote for anything don't you think
Rockabye rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye rockabye

Rockabye rockabye
Rockabye rockabye

She's blood flesh and bone
No tucks or silicone
She's touch smell sight taste and sound
But somehow I can't believe
That anything should happen
I know where I belong
And nothin's gonna happen
Yeah yeah
Cause she's so high
High above me she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra Joan of Arc or Aphrodite
She's so high
High above me
First class and fancy free
She's high society
She's got the best of everything
What could a guy like me
Ever really offer
She's perfect as she can be
Why should I even bother
Ya ya

High above me she's so lovely

She's all I ever had  
She's the air I breathe  
Take this empty life I lead  
Fill it with the love I need 

She's all I ever had  

And right or wrong  
I'm not ashamed  
I'll never place  
Anyone above her 

And all the memories  
Ev'ry place we've been  
Take me back to where it began 

She's all I ever had  

Through the wind and the rain  
She stands hard as a stone  
In a world that she can't rise above  
But her dreams give her wings  
And she flies to a place where she's loved  

Concrete angel  

I've been around the world  
Looking for someone like you  
And I finally found  
The one that makes me feel like I should  

Through the rain and the storm  
Some things will never change  
Sensing the joy and the love  
She brings to me each day  

She's all I ever had  
It's the way she makes me feel  
It's the only thing that's real  
It's the way she understands  

She's all I ever had  

Through the wind and the rain  
She stands hard as a stone  
In a world that she can't rise above  
But her dreams give her wings  
And she flies to a place where she's loved  

Concrete angel  

Through the wind and the rain  
She stands hard as a stone  
In a world that she can't rise above  
But her dreams give her wings  
And she flies to a place where she's loved  

Concrete angel  

And when the night falls  
I pray that I don't wake up alone  

She's all I ever had  
She's all I'll ever need  
And when the night falls  
She's the only one that's there for me  

Concrete angel

Yes here are the uncensored lyrics of "Hands" by Jewel:

If I could tell the world just one thing
It would be that we're all ok
And not to worry because worry is wasteful
And useless in times like these
I won't be made useless
I won't be idle with despair
I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

My hands are small I know
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

Poverty stole your golden shoes
But it didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But I knew it wasn't ever after
We'll fight not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

My hands are small I know
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

In the end only kindness matters
In the end only kindness matters

My hands are small I know
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

My hands are small I know
But they're not yours they are my own
But they're not yours they are my own
And I am never broken

Hoe shake your ass and do that twist
And oh if you could dance you better pop that clit
And power too sweet to be sour
Got a voice like the angels and pussy like a flower flowers
But JT beat the power
Strokin' on your bones and leavin' your vajayjay sour
It's the J to the T yeah JT Money
And that nigga been paid when that nigga gettin' money Money money money

Shouldn't have to ask for it girl don't be silly

Three niggas in one and those three niggas gettin' money Money money money
Hokey-pokey and I'm shakin' up the scene
Jean jacket Timbs and a neck full of green
Man these niggas can't stop me
Every time I come through they gotta jock me
Got the brains and the brawn
And when it comes to fuckin' I got it goin' on
If I played basketball it'd be 'cause the Lakers shelled out
These niggas just bought a car I just bought a fuckin' house
It's that Jam Pony cat with that Slip-N-Slide sound
And if you don't like it nigga {gunshot} off his crown

I'm the baddest in the South these haters wanna hate
'Cause I'm the QB that they could never sack or penetrate
Wakin' up in the morning with my mind on my money
Countin' my dough gotta get my hustle on me and my honey
So tell me who that is tryna check my package
Fuckin' with my man when you need to mind your business
Jealous-ass bitches never succeed
But Ima make it to the top with a pocket full of G's
Let the world know I'm a lady with class
So when y'all hear about ya girl know that she's on the rise fast
The best thing since salt-n-pepper
And it's unfortunate disrespectin' me will cost ya
So when you see me on the block and I'm chillin' with my squad
Mind your business fool and don't be actin' hard


Who dat who dat who dat is

All up in my shit when I'm tryna get rich Who
All up in my shit when I'm tryna get rich
When all our tears have reached the sea
Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
A new wind is gonna find your sail
That's where your journey starts

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Just like the waves down by the shore
We're gonna keep on comin' back for more
'Cause we don't ever wanna stop
Out in this brave new world you seek
Oh the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

Remember me when you're out walkin'
When snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleepin'
And moonlight falls across your floor

When I can't hurt you anymore
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me
Please remember me

Verse 1:
It could all be so simple
But you’d rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be
To gain some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

Chorus:
Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can’t stay
Tell me where I have gone wrong
In a feeling that I’m feeling
The love is unconditional
But I’m not a fool I know you’re just playing

Verse 2:
I have already paid for
All my future sins
There’s nothing anyone
Can say to take this back
But if you’re trying to make me laugh
Why try to make me cry
Every time I see your face
It makes me wanna die

Chorus:
Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name

Tell me where I have gone wrong

Baby's black balloon makes her fly  
I almost fell into that hole in your life  
And you're not thinking about tomorrow  
'Cause you were the same as me  
But on your knees  
A thousand other boys could never reach you  
How could I have been the one  
I saw the world spin beneath you  
And scatter like ice from the spoon that was your womb  
Comin' down the world turned over  
And angels fall without you there  
And I go on as you get colder  
Or are you someone's prayer  
You know the lies they always told you  
And the love you never knew  
What's the things they never showed you  
That swallowed the light from the sun inside your room  
Yeah yeah yeah…  
Comin' down the world turned over  
And angels fall without you there  
And I go on as you get colder  
All because I'm  
Comin' down the years turn over  
And angels fall without you there  
And I'll go on and lead you home and  
All because I'm  
All because I'm  
And I'll become  
What you became to me  


Bring back that loving feeling
Oh that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling
Now it's gonegonegonewoooooohhhh


I can't go on
No without you
Oh it hurts so much
Don't know what to do


I'm standing here
Dying inside
Can't take it no more
No more tears in my eyes


I can't go on
No without you
Oh it hurts so much
Don't know what to do


These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can take our time and talk


I can't go on
No without you
Oh it hurts so much
Don't know what to do


Baby love now I find
I do need you by my side
Don't you know that you complete me
You got me going crazy baby


I can't go on
No without you
Oh it hurts so much
Don't know what to do


These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can take our time and talk
These are the times we'll cherish

Wooooohhhh
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Because of You" by 98 Degrees:


You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
‘Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around
It's all It’s all
It's all because of you


You're my sunshine oh yeah
Baby I really know by now
Since we met that day
You showed me the way
I felt it then you gave me love I can't explain
How much I feel for you I said baby oh baby


You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
‘Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around
It's all It’s all
It's all because of you


Oh how I wish that you were here
When I'm saying "I love you"
It makes those words so easy to say
How I feel for you
And how it's been from the beginning
You're there for me oh baby


You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
‘Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around
It's all It’s all
It's all because of you


Oh oh yeah yeah

Oh oh yeah yeah
If you should ever wonder why
In my heart I'm dfefinitely sure


You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
‘Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around
It's all It’s all
It's all because of you


Everything I do I feel alright
Alright oh yeah
It's all because of you oh yeah
Verse 1:
I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Pre-Chorus:
Remember the good times that we had
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me I wanna be the one

Chorus:
I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Verse 2:
I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside but we can't be heard

Pre-Chorus:
But I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Chorus:
I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Bridge:
I'm so afraid to love you but more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had oh you gave me light

Chorus:
And I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

And I will remember you
Will you remember me
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
Weep not for the memories

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Almost Doesn't Count" by Brandy:


Almost made you love me
Almost made you cry
Almost made you happy babe
Didn't I didn't I
You almost had me thinking
You were turned around
But everybody knows
Almost doesn't count


Almost heard you saying
You were finally free
What was always missing for you babe
You found it in me
But you can't get to heaven
Half off the ground
Everybody knows
Almost doesn't count


I can't keep on loving you
One foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation
Of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on trying
If you're looking for more
Than all that I could give you
Than what you came here for


Gonna find me somebody
Not afraid to let go
Want a no-doubt be-there-kind-of-matter
Don't wanna waste my time

Oh yeah
Someone who wants me
And nothing but me
Oh almost convinced me
I'm moving on and you're fading away
I can't keep on loving you
One foot outside the door
Let's go girls

Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise really raise my voice

The best thing about bein' a woman

I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self defeating routine
My mind was thugged all laced and bugged all twisted wrong and beat
A comfort not in a database of my dreams

I was lounging in the park across the way
Lazing in the foggy dew
Of my so private getaway

But couldn't get the nerve to say
Hello hello hello

I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy

So if you wanna be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see

But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery

Besides maybe this time is different
I mean I really think you like me

Ah-ha want to know can you feel it
Ah-ha want to know can you feel it

You know where it's at
You know where it's at
You know where it's at
You know where it's at

Do you believe in the day that you were born Yeah
Tell me do you believe No

Do you know that there's a way out yeah
Tell me now Tell me now

Do you see that there's a way out Tell me now
Tell me do you see How now brown cow

You know where it's at
You know where it's at
You know where it's at
You know where it's at

I was lying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-a-t-e-r that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap

Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring underheat
Involved an underusual feat
Of a typical day like this

With a girl like you a-a-a-ah
With a girl like you a-a-a-ah

Rob's verse about ping pong

Slippery slender slender ray of hope I hope
The funny flipping farce will cope
The funny cheated goals we scored
Sentimental-ness aside you know
Oh yeah

When we're together we could be forever
When we're together we could be forever
When we're together we could be forever
We could be forever
You know where it's at
You know where it's at
You know where it's at
You know where it's at
Okay here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Need to Know" by Marc Anthony:

They say around the way you've asked for me  
There's even talk about you wanting me  
I must admit that's what I want to hear  
But that's just talk until you take me there oh

If it's true don't leave me all alone out here  
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there  
Tell me what you're feeling 'cause I need to know  
Girl you've got to let me know which way to go  
'Cause I need to know  
I need to know

Tell me babygirl 'cause I need to know  
I need to know  

I don't know what to expect this time  
And I'm prepared to cross the line  
And if it's true oh baby please don't deny  
Tell me how you feel if you want me  
Too long I've been afraid of  
Love and what it might do  
But god knows that I'm so in love with you  

If you're feeling all right  
Baby we can take all night  
Show me what you feel  
Come to me babe  
I need to know  
I need to know  

Tell me babygirl 'cause I need to know  
I need to know

Roll over I'm still here alone

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Faded Pictures" by Case featuring Joe:


We used to be inseparable
Now the love has died and it's pitiful oh yeah
Played me with your sweet caress
Took me places I confess
But you kept your wings reserved
How could you forget the best love you ever had baby


I can't believe that life's so complex
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress
I'd be the one to caress you when you're lonely
Share stories of lovers we have known yeah
Take pleasure in your intellect
Every time our bodies connect
I'm in heaven when you're next to me
Gettin' crazy ecstasy baby


Yeah yeah faded pictures in my broken heart
Tryna put it back together but it's torn apart
I'm still finding pieces where you used to be
And I'm feelin' you staring from miles away

Memories of when we were lovers
How I missed the way you'd say you need me
But now you're gone I'm alone
Tryna be strong but the pain keeps holding on

See it's been a while and it still hurts
Everytime I think of you I feel cursed
I still hear your voice and you're sweet sweet melodies
But now my eyes are gettin' blurry and I can't see

I can't believe that life's so complex
When I just wanna sit here and watch you undress
I'd be the one to caress you when you're lonely
Share stories of lovers we have known yeah
Take pleasure in your intellect
Every time our bodies connect
I'm in heaven when you're next to me
Gettin' crazy ecstasy baby


Yeah yeah faded pictures in my broken heart
Tryna put it back together but it's torn apart
I'm still finding pieces where you used to be
And I'm feelin' you staring from miles away

Memories of when we were lovers
How I missed the way you'd say you need me
But now you're gone I'm alone
Tryna be strong but the pain keeps holding on

Faded pictures in my broken heart
Tryna put it back together but it's torn apart
I'm still finding pieces where you used to be
And I'm feelin' you staring from miles away oh

Memories of when we were lovers
How I missed the way you'd say you need me
But now you're gone I'm alone
Tryna be strong but the pain the pain keeps holding on holding on
Verse 1:
It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you that now I'm for real
If all things in time time will reveal

Chorus:
One you're like a dream come true
Two just want to be with you
Three girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four repeat steps one through three
Five make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one yeah

Verse 2:
It's so incredible the way things work themselves out
And all emotional once you know what it's all about hey
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would have made it very far
Cause you know you've got the keys to my heart

Chorus:
One you're like a dream come true
Two just want to be with you
Three girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four repeat steps one through three
Five make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one yeah

Bridge:
Say farewell to the dark of night
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time

Chorus:
One you're like a dream come true
Two just want to be with you
Three girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four repeat steps one through three

That you're the only one for me
And four repeat steps one through three
Five make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one yeah
Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you
Verse One:
Ayo you best to be strapped with your weapon
When walking through the back alleys of these slums world
Cause ain't no telling when the holts
Gonna ratta-tat-tat you betta ask somebody
Cause in the jungle only the strong survive
It's do or die and the food they eat
Is not enough to keep em'alive it's so hard
To keep my head up and not go crazy I'm so tired
But I gotta keep moving I got my family right beside me

Chorus:
Ghetto Cowboy tryin' to stay alive
Ghetto Cowboy tryin' to feed my child

Verse Two:
How many feel like die'n
And nobody cares the world is treatin ya bad and it feels like no one's there
I wanna talk to the mayor the governor the president
I wanna ask them can they answer some of these questions I askin'
Why am I here
Where am I goin' Where's my future
What am I doing And why I'm still poor Why am I ignored
Why do I feel this way Why won't it ever change
And why am I hated and why can't we make a change

Chorus:
Ghetto Cowboy tryin' to stay alive
Ghetto Cowboy tryin' to feed my child

Verse Three:
I see in the future we'll paint a better picture
Of how it is and how it use to be before this government
Take over here's a four leaf clover
I'll plant it for the future and let it get stronger
And if my words aren't clear then my actions is gon' speak
For me I'm tired of the vicious cycle- the gun fires and Police
And drug suppliers all the users and the liars
It's steadily tearing down our community and we all losers
But if we all come together and raise up against the devil's trick
We can put away the drugs and guns and make our families stick
Cause even when life seems hard man we've come too far
Still we got to maintain and stay on our job
And if you feeling how I'm feeling put your fists up in the air
And let's unite together show the Government we care

Chorus:
Ghetto Cowboy tryin' to stay alive
Ghetto Cowboy tryin' to feed my child

Outro:
Cause it's a constant struggle everyday gotta roll on 6x
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Out of My Head" by Fastball:

Spent all my time just thinking
Love was a game I could win
Left all my dreams in the hands of fate
Took all my chances with you and gambled away

Now the reels been spun
And the bets been laid
You turned up the last card
And took all my pain

Out of my head
Out of my head
I've been waiting for you
To come back again

And everybody's talking
'bout you and her in love
How could you leave me
When you knew you were the one

And now I'm standing on this street corner
Trying to find the strength to carry on
Looking for a way out of this madness
I'm lost and alone

Out of my head
Out of my head
I've been waiting for you
To come back again

Out of my head
Out of my head
I've been waiting for you
To come back again

Now the rain falls down
On this lonely town
And the wind cries out
A haunting sound

And I'm lost without you
And I'm lost without you

Out of my head
Out of my head
I've been waiting for you
To come back again

Out of my head
Out of my head
I've been waiting for you
To come back again
Verse 1:
Check the bassline out uh-huh
Jigga uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah
Let it bump though
It's the hard knock life uh-huh for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Steada treated we get tricked uh-huh
Steada kisses we get kicked
It's the hard knock life
From standing on the corners boppin'
To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For dropping some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot with the smoke Glock
Fleeing the murder scene you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail
Fuck naw where all my niggas with the rubber grips bust shots
And if you with me momma rub on your tits and what not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Sean Carter nigga Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready uh-huh
It's the hard knock life for us it's the hard knock life
It's the hard knock life for us
Steada treated we get tricked
Steada kisses we get kicked
It's the hard knock life uh-huh
For us it's the hard knock life for us
Steada treated we get tricked
Steada kisses we get kicked
It's the hard knock life uh-huh

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "A Lesson in Leavin'" by Jo Dee Messina:

Verse 1:
You say stayin's the right thing 
But I'm kinda used to leavin'
Lately I've been hearin'
Voices I ain't never heard before

Chorus:
Standin' in the doorway
Hopin' I can hear you say
I'll be all you need and more
So I'm standin' in the hallway
Singerin' to myself
A little whispered melody about you

Verse 2:
Everything changes 
Even the best-laid plans
Sometimes a truer love is waiting
In the wings of a night that understands

Chorus:
Standin' in the doorway
Hopin' I can hear you say
I'll be all you need and more
So I'm standin' in the hallway
Singerin' to myself
A little whispered melody about you

Bridge:
It hurts when love ain't right
So I've been takin' chances
And I just need to know that you're behind me

Chorus:
Standin' in the doorway
Hopin' I can hear you say
I'll be all you need and more
So I'm standin' in the hallway
Singerin' to myself

Verse 1:
So take the party lights and wrap them around
Take the baseline and pump it up a notch
Take the crowd and move 'em all downtown
Take the speakers and drop 'em on the floor
Let's take our problems and let them to the sky
Let the beat and the bass line get 'em high
We'll overwhelm 'em with the rhythm and rhyme
Better days better days are coming our way

Chorus:
And the bottom drops out
When the rhythm finally found me
The bottom drops out
When I start to feel alive

Verse 2:
Now get yourself together let the light pour in
Pour in like a waterfall let it wash wash
Lose yourself inside the crowd let the rhythm get down
Let yourself go wild wild
And let that feeling really take over
And let that heat and the beat take you over
Let the beat let the bass take you over
Better days better days are coming our way

Chorus:
And the bottom drops out
When the rhythm finally found me
The bottom drops out
When I start to feel alive

Bridge:
Yeah yeah find some better days
Better days find some better days
Better days find some better days
Better days find some better days

Chorus:
And the bottom drops out
When the rhythm finally found me
The bottom drops out
When I start to feel alive

Outro:
Better days better days better days
Coming our way
Better days better days better days
Coming our way

Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we knew we could oh yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe When you believe
Somehow you will Somehow you will
You will when you believe
Mm yeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now Im standing here
My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill Mmm
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve You can achieve
When you believe When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
Mmmmm
They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears Oh oh
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way to get through the rain
Aaah-aah-hoo
A small but still resilient voice
Says love is very near oh Oh
There can be miracles Miracles
When you believe Boy when you believe yeah
Though hope is frail Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill Hard to kill oh yeah
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve You can achieve oh

Somehow you will Somehow somehow somehow
Now you will Now you will
You will when you believe
Oh yeah
You will when you

When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine

I look at you
Looking at me
I'm gonna love you
Boy you are so fine
Angel of mine

How you changed my world
You'll never know
I'm different now
You helped me grow
You came into

When I lost all hope
you showed me love

I'm checkin' for ya
Boy you're right on time
Angel of mine

How you changed my world
You'll never know

You helped me grow

As if it were new
Every breath that I take
The love that we make
I only share it with you

When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine
Angel of mine

This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

You didn't think to call me boy

Chorus:
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face

Until you played with my emotions and made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me

She's into superstitions black cats and voodoo dolls  
I feel a premonition that girl's gonna make me fall  
She's into new sensations new kicks in the candlelight  
She's got a new addiction for every day and night  

She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain  
She'll make you live her crazy life but she'll take away your pain  
Like a bullet to your brain upside inside out  
She's living la vida loca  

Her lips are devil red and her skin's the color of mocha  
She will wear you out living la vida loca  
Come on  

Living la vida loca  
Come on  

She's living la vida loca  

Woke up in New York City in a funky cheap motel  
She took my heart and she took my money  
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill  

She never drinks the water makes you order French champagne  
Once you've had a taste of her you'll never be the same  
Yeah she'll make you go insane upside inside out  
She's living la vida loca  

Her lips are devil red and her skin's the color of mocha  
She will wear you out living la vida loca  
Living la vida loca  
She'll push and pull you down  
Living la vida loca  
Her lips are devil red and her skin's the color of mocha  
She will wear you out living la vida loca

Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Back 2 Good" by Matchbox Twenty:

It's nothing it's so normal you
Just stand there I could say so much
But I don't go there 'cause I don't want to
I was thinking if you're lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

Everywhere I go I see you
And it hurts me so
I don't know what we should do
I don't know what we should do
I don't know what we should do

I don't want to leave you stranded
But I am trying to think of what to say
To make you listen
To make you understand
What I'm trying to say

Everywhere I go I see you
And it hurts me so
I don't know what we should do
I don't know what we should do
I don't know what we should do

Oh I'm trying to get back to good
But I don't know if I'm standing in the place where you could
Oh love I wait
Oh love I wait

But I never know where you are
I never know where you are
Everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you
And everywhere I go you're there

'Cause I'm trying to get back to good
Oh oh oh
Trying to get back to good
Verse 1:
Baby I will love you more than that
I won't say that I'm the only one
Who loves you like crazy I'll never lie
You're the one who makes this hood to life

Chorus:
And every time I think of you
I get a shot right through
Into a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine
But it's a problem I find
Living the life that I can't leave behind
But there's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
While every day my confusion grows

Verse 2:
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

Chorus:
And every time I think of you
I get a shot right through
Into a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine
But it's a problem I find
Living the life that I can't leave behind
But there's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
While every day my confusion grows

Outro:
Don't you leave me baby
Don't you leave me baby
Cause I love you go

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Spend My Life with You" by Eric Benét featuring Tamia:

I never knew such a day could come
And I never knew such a love
Could be inside of one
And I never knew what my life was for
But now that you're here
I know for sure
I never knew till I looked in your eyes
I wasn't complete till the day you walked into my life
And I never knew that my heart could feel so precious
And pure
One love so real when I thought I knew
All along
I didn't know nothing 'til I met you

And I wanna spend my life with you
And I wanna spend my life with you

Wherever you go I will follow
Wherever you are that's where I want to be
With you oh

Looking back over my life
I see that I've made mistakes
But I know that I needed to go through that
To get me where I am today

And I never knew till I looked in your eyes
I wasn't complete till the day you walked into my life
And I never knew that my heart could feel so precious
And pure
One love so real when I thought I knew
All along
I didn't know nothing 'til I met you

And I wanna spend my life with you
And I wanna spend my life with you

Wherever you go I will follow
Wherever you are that's where I want to be
With you oh

With you oh

With you oh

And I never knew that my heart could feel so precious
And pure
One love so real when I thought I knew
All along
I didn't know nothing 'til I met you

And I wanna spend my life with you
And I wanna spend my life with you

Wherever you go I will follow
Wherever you are that's where I want to be
With you oh

And I never knew that my heart could feel so precious
And pure
One love so real when I thought I knew
All along
I didn't know nothing 'til I met you

And I wanna spend my life with you
And I wanna spend my life with you

Wherever you go I will follow
Wherever you are that's where I want to be
With you oh
All I am
All I'll be
Everything in this world
All that I'll ever need

Is in your eyes
Shining at me
When you smile I can feel
All my passion unfolding

Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations
Seduce me 'cause I
Chorus:
I do cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
From the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do

In my world
Before you
I lived outside my emotions
Didn't know where I was going
'Till that day I found you
How you opened my life
To a new paradise

In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart
'Till my dying day

Chorus

I see forever in your eyes
Repeat Chorus
If tomorrow is judgement day 
And I'm standing on the front line 
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life 
I will say I spent it with you 

If I wake up in World War III 
I see destruction and poverty 
And I feel like I want to go home 
It's okay if you're coming with me 

'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 

Your love is my love 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 

If I should die this very day 
Don't cry 'cause on Earth we wasn't meant to stay 
And no matter what the people say 
I'll be waiting for you after judgement day 

'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 

Your love is my love 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 

It's a long long journey 
Till I find my way home to you 
Many days I've spent 
Drifting on through 

Empty shores 
Wondering what's my purpose 
Wondering how to make it through 

The vision of you 
Sitting standing lying by my side 
The mission of you 
Making sure that I'm all right 

Your love is my love 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 

Your love is my love 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 

Your love is my love 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us 

Your love is my love 
And my love is your love 
It would take an eternity to break us 
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
Verse 1:
I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying "damn" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone
'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg no
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it

Chorus:
It's like running out of love
And oh it's like running out of love
When a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg no
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it

Verse 2:
I'm living in a hotel
Heart broke down can't take it no more
Tearing down these walls
Lil' by lil' brick by brick
Getting rid of everything
That reminds me of all of her oh
I'm gonna call up my old friends
And a couple of women I've been knowing for a while oh damn
I'm gonna have a good time good time
And for a little while I'm gonna smile

Chorus:
When a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg no
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love oh
And oh it's like running out of love out of love
When a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg no
It ain't nothing you can do about it nothing you can do
It's just like running out of love nothing you can do
And it's like running out of love

Outro:
It ain't nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love
It ain't nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love oh
When a woman's fed up oh
Big 35's whinin' on the asphalt
Grabbin' drinks at a bar called Flip-Flops
We were up to our necks in Corona and salt
The night was still young and so were we
Talked a lot about livin' life right
Bein' with a woman who could roll with the punches
Stay up and struggle through the long dark nights
We toasted to love but it wasn't enough

One shot two shot copper tone tan
Countin' bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the band
They're playin' "Chasing that neon rainbow"
Only lost one let's go get a taco
Who wants to work to work all week
Dance in the sand sleep in the sea
We don't have a lot but we got enough
Just try and keep the tan lines faded

How forever feels
That's the question to ask
Were you happy with a one-night stand
Or the girl that you're taking home
Are you happy with yourself
Or do you need someone to take your life off the shelf
We'll keep on livin' life like this
You and me hangin' on to one another
And turnin' this world around
We're solid bound and what's up ahead
Like two children bein' led
By the wishes in our hearts

One shot two shot three jobs
Atta boy nail that overtime
Boss man can sure try to get us down
But we'll just come back stronger
I've got some friends in this town
That you can't find in the phone book
They're good with a wrench or a hammer
And they don't mind gettin' dirt on their hands
But don't let those good looks fool you

How forever feels
That's the question to ask
Were you happy with a one-night stand
Or the girl that you're taking home
Are you happy with yourself
Or do you need someone to take your life off the shelf
We'll keep on livin' life like this
You and me hangin' on to one another
And turnin' this world around
We're solid bound and what's up ahead
Like two children bein' led
By the wishes in our hearts

Yeah we'll keep on livin' life like this
You and me hangin' on to one another
And turnin' this world around
We're solid bound and what's up ahead
Like two children bein' led
By the wishes in our hearts
Verse 1:
You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Chorus:
Sometimes I run sometimes
Sometimes I hide sometimes
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right be with you day and night
Baby all I need is time

Verse 2:
I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Chorus:
Sometimes I run sometimes
Sometimes I hide sometimes
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right be with you day and night
Baby all I need is time

Bridge:
Just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me trust in me
The way that I trust in you

Chorus:
Sometimes I run sometimes
Sometimes I hide sometimes
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right be with you day and night
Sometimes I run sometimes
Sometimes I hide sometimes
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right be with you day and night
Baby all I need is time
Can Do Here are the uncensored lyrics of "God Must Have Spent A Little More Time on You" by Alabama and NSYNC:

Can This Be True
Tell Me Can This Be Real
How Can I Put Into Words
What I Feel

My Life Was Complete
I Thought I Was Whole
Why Do I Feel Like I'm Losing Control
I Never Thought That Love Could Feel Like This
Then You Changed My World With Just One Kiss

How Can It Be That Right Here With Me
There's An Angel

It's A Miracle

Your Love Is Like a River
Peaceful and Deep
Your Soul Is Like a Secret
That I Never Could Keep
When I Look Into Your Eyes
I Know That It's True
God Must Have Spent
A Little More Time On You

A Little More Time Yes He Did Baby

In All Of Creation All Things Great and Small
You Are The One That Surpasses Them All
More precious than Any Diamond or Pearl
They Broke the Mold When You Came In This World

And I'm Trying Hard to Figure Out
Just How I Ever Did Without
The Warmth Of Your Smile
The Heart Of A Child

That's Deep Inside

Leaves Me Wondering
How God Thought of You

Your Love Is Like a River
Peaceful and Deep
Your Soul Is Like a Secret
That I Never Could Keep
When I Look Into Your Eyes
I Know That It's True
God Must Have Spent
A Little More Time On You

A Little More Time Yes He Did Baby

Never Thought That Love Could Feel Like This
And You Changed My World With Just One Kiss
How Can It Be That Right Here With Me
There's An Angel

Your Love Is Like a River
Peaceful and Deep
Your Soul Is Like a Secret
That I Never Could Keep
When I Look Into Your Eyes
I Know That It's True
God Must Have Spent
A Little More Time On You

Your Love Is Like a River
Peaceful and Deep
Your Soul Is Like a Secret
That I Never Could Keep
When I Look Into Your Eyes
I Know That It's True
God Must Have Spent
A Little More Time On You

On You On You
I'm sorry but "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" is actually a song by Aerosmith not Mark Chesnutt Nevertheless here are the uncensored lyrics:


I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure


Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing


Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever forever and ever


Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing


I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well I just wanna be with you
Right here with you just like this
I just wanna hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time


Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Verse One:
Everytime I see you I gotta skip a beat
What I feel inside is oh so deep
I'm not usually the kind to be swept off my feet
But you got me feeling like I'm in a dream

Pre-Chorus:
I don't know what it is that you do
But every time you come around I feel like a fool
Sometimes I don't know how to act
'Cause I never felt this way before no

Chorus:
Chanté's got a man at home
And he's sure 'nuff good to me
Gave him lovin' all through the night
But he's gotta be the one you see

Verse Two:
Every time I see you I try to hide
But when we're together it feels so right
I had a man but I didn't think twice
'Cause I never felt a feeling so right

Pre-Chorus:
I don't know what it is that you do
But every time you come around I feel like a fool
Sometimes I don't know how to act
'Cause I never felt this way before no

Chorus:
Chanté's got a man at home
And he's sure 'nuff good to me
Gave him lovin' all through the night
But he's gotta be the one you see

Bridge:
Oh I know it's wrong
But the feeling's so strong
I can't hold on
I can't let go

Chorus:
Chanté's got a man at home
And he's sure 'nuff good to me
Gave him lovin' all through the night
But he's gotta be the one you see

Outro:
Chanté's got a man Chanté's got a man
Chanté's got a man Chanté's got a man

Oh yeah
Yeah yeah


Loving you it seems like a lifetime
Making up ain't easy but it sure feels fine
When we lay down to sleep at night
It's understood yeah we gotta make it right


Love ain't fair so we gotta be stronger
Forgive and forget or our love won't go any longer
We gotta be right can't be wrong
Or our love won't last long


Trust me every single day
I'll be loving you in every single way
Let's not waste another minute
Time is precious and love is infinite


Love ain't fair so we gotta be stronger
Forgive and forget or our love won't go any longer
We gotta be right can't be wrong
Or our love won't last long


And when we're old and grey
Remember all the love that we've made
And in the end we'll live happily ever after
Oh happily ever after


Love ain't fair so we gotta be stronger
Forgive and forget or our love won't go any longer
We gotta be right can't be wrong
Or our love won't last long


And when we're old and grey
Remember all the love that we've made
And in the end we'll live happily ever after
Oh happily ever after
Verse 1:
Don't you ever wish you were someone else 
You were meant to be the way you are exactly 
Don't you ever say you don't like the way you are 
When you learn to love yourself you're better off by far 

And I hope you always stay the same 
'Cause there's nothing 'bout you I would change 

Chorus:
I think that you could be whatever you wanted to be 
If you could realize all the dreams you have inside 
Don't be afraid if you've got something to say 
Just open up your heart and let it show you the way

Verse 2:
Believe in yourself 
Reach down inside 
The love you find will set you free 
Believe in yourself you will come alive 
Have faith in what you do 
You'll make it through

Chorus

Bridge:
Oh don't you know that dreaming is a waste of time 
And dreaming's just a way to hide the hurt inside 
And oh don't you know that dreaming is a waste of time 
And dreaming's just a way to hide the hurt inside 

Chorus x2

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now


And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight


And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am


And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight


And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am


And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight


I just don't wanna miss you tonight
I just don't wanna miss you tonight
And I don't wanna miss a thing
I will provide the uncensored lyrics of "Unpretty" by TLC below:


Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast


Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is "Baby it's good to me"


One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place


Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast


I think you're moving too fast Moving too fast
Rap
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is "Baby it's good to me"
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Yeah pretty ain't everything this is for the ones
Who feel like they're no good for the ones who feel ugly


Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast


Richie Rich is what Richie says he is Yo
But a big bank account don't mean you're rich
What you want is what you can't have
And if you just abide you might just survive
But a word to the wise if you like to stay alive

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast don't go chasing waterfalls
Ooh yeah yeah yeah


Understand this is for the ones
Ooh yeah
Understand this is for the ones
Ooh yeah
For the ones who can relate to feelin' unpretty
Feelin' unpretty
We're treated unjustly talked about for nothin'
Treated like we're nothin' ooh
Verse 1:  
Never seen a sun shine like this  
Never seen the moon glow like this  
Never seen the waterfalls like this  
Never seen the lights off like this  

Hook:  
Never dug anyone like this  
Never had tasty lips to kiss  
Never had someone to miss  
Never heard a song quite like this  

Chorus:  
Fortunate to have you girl  
I'm so glad you're in my world  
Just as sure as the sky is blue  
I bless the day that I found you  

Verse 2:  
Never had room service all night  
Never took a first-class flight  
Never had a backseat lover  
Never had a damn thing under cover  

Repeat Hook & Chorus  

Bridge:  
You're the only girl who never made me wait  
And you're the only girl who rocks my body  
I'm so happy that you're mine  
So glad we've reached this moment in time  

Repeat Chorus until fade
Verse 1:
I never knew there was a love like this before
Never had someone to show me love love like this before
Now that we have come to be
A brand new life I can't see
Never thought you'd be a special part of me no baby
The reasons are because of you
I can go on and make it through
I can't even take my mind off loving you
And I wanna say

Chorus:
I thank God for you I thank God I thank him
From deep down inside from the bottom of my heart yeah
God all I wanna do is thank you baby
Thank you baby

Verse 2:
You were there through thick and thin you were there
My ups and downs my joy and tears hoo
God you're my everything you're my everything
I love you 'til the end of time I love you
Words can't express what you mean to me
You made my life worth living again
I pray to God that he'll keep you alive
Just to be with me that's why I wanna say

I thank God for you thank you Lord
From deep down inside from the bottom of my heart yeah
God all I wanna do is thank you baby

And for your love I'd give my last breath
