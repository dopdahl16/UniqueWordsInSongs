Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over


But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough


No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Somebody I used to know
Somebody now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody I used to know
Somebody now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know


But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough


No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Somebody I used to know
Somebody now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody I used to know
Somebody now you're just somebody that I used to know


I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know
Somebody


No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Somebody I used to know
Somebody Somebody now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody I used to know
Somebody Now you're just somebody that I used to know


I used to know
Somebody
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans skin was showing
Hot night wind was blowing
Where do you think you're going baby

Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me maybe

It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number so call me maybe

Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me maybe

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so so bad

It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number so call me maybe

Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me maybe

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me maybe

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad

The sun goes down the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came I'm glad you came
You cast a spell on me spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me fell on me
And I decided you look well on me well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see you and me
Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time
Time is slipping away
Away from us so stay
Stay with me I can make
Make you glad you came
The sun goes down the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
I'm glad you came oh
I'm glad you came ooh
I'm glad you came
So glad you came
Yellow diamonds in the light  
And we're standing side by side  
As your shadow crosses mine  
What it takes to come alive  

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny  
But I've gotta let it go  

We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  

Shine a light through an open door  
Love and life I will divide  
Turn away cause I need you more  
Feel the heartbeat in my mind  

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny  
But I've gotta let it go  

We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  

Yellow diamonds in the light  
And we're standing side by side  
As your shadow crosses mine  

We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place  
We found love in a hopeless place
Let's go to the beach each
Let's go get away
They say what they gonna say

Bad chicks like me is hard to come by
The Patrón own let's go get it on
The zone own yes I'm in the zone

Get on the floor floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Verse two:
I'm higher than a motherfucker
More fire than a son of a bitch
Satellites I'm a keep it coming
'Cause I'm heartless and I'm bad to the bone
You can say anything you like
But you can't touch my fuckin' flow
I'm fancy huh I'm fancy huh
I'm high and I'm just saying
Like oh you ain't got it
Got it You can't get it
'Cause I'm fly like a helicopter

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Verse three:
We're higher than a motherfucker
And we're hotter than some lava
And big bang clockin' all these dollars
Got me feelin' like money money
If you were getting high
Then just drop it low low
Or go like "Hell yeah yeah"
'Cause it's one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful


If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw


Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up I still see your ghost
Oh Lord I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for What do I stand for
Most nights I don't know anymore


This is it boys this is war - what are we waiting for
Why don't we break the rules already
I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked but here they come again to jack my style


And that's alright - I found a martyr in my bed tonight
Oh who am I Oh who am I - mmm mmm
Well some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights I always win I always win


But I still wake up I still see your ghost
Oh Lord I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for What do I stand for
Most nights I don't know oh come on


So this is it I sold my soul for this
Washed my hands of that for this
I miss my mom and dad for this
Sh*t Come on
No no no no no no no
One two three - hey
This is it boys this is war - what are we waiting for
Why don't we break the rules already

Can do Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Whistle" by Flo Rida:

Can you blow my whistle baby Whistle baby let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby Whistle baby here we go

I'm betting you like people
And I'm betting you love freak mode
And I'm betting you like girls that give love to girls
And stroke your little ego

I bet you I'm guilty your honor
That's just how we live in my genre
Who in the hell done paved the road wider
There's only one Flo and one Rida

I'm a damn shame
Order more champagne pull a damn hamstring
Tryna put it on ya let it flow like a trumpet
Call me the Grizelda Blanco of the trap bass
That's cool baby girl do it la liga
No te pongas triste there's no crying in baseball
Ride with me mamacita
Let me tell you something

You need a brilliant Miss Kathy
But I let her do the dishes
I'm a Miami El Berkowitz all ya'll want to is do it

Can you blow my whistle baby Whistle baby let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow Real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby Whistle baby here we go

Whistle baby whistle baby whistle baby

It's like everywhere I go
My whistle ready to blow
Shawty don't leave a note
She can get any by the low
Permission not approved
It's okay it's under control
Show me soprano cause girl you can handle
Baby we start snagging your pants you're slowly dragging
You really thinking you gon' get it bass bragging
Tattoos sweatpants and some chucks chucks
The game is on wanna play
Want to play I love the way you're playing
And if you're good I'll give you my last name

You should blow my whistle baby Whistle baby let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby Whistle baby here we go

Whistle baby whistle baby whistle baby

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Everybody Talks" by Neon Trees as follows:


Hey baby won't you look my way
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby what you gotta say
All you're giving me is fiction


I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
I found out that everybody talks everybody talks everybody talks


It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
And everybody talks everybody talks everybody talks too much


It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
And everybody talks everybody talks


Everybody talks everybody talks
Everybody talks too much


It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
And everybody talks everybody talks everybody talks too much


I'm going underground going underground
Well let the walls come down let the walls come down
Everybody talks everybody talks
Everybody talks too much


It started with a whisper everybody talks everybody talks
And that was when I kissed her everybody talks everybody talks
And then she made my lips hurt everybody talks everybody talks
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
And everybody talks everybody talks everybody talks too much


It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
You shout it out  
But I can't hear a word you say  
I'm talking loud not saying much  
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet  
You shoot me down but I get up  
  
I'm bulletproof nothing to lose  
Fire away fire away  
Ricochet you take your aim  
Fire away fire away  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
  
Cut me down  
But it's you who'll have further to fall  
Ghost town and haunted love  
Raise your voice sticks and stones may break my bones  
I'm talking loud not saying much  
  
I'm bulletproof nothing to lose  
Fire away fire away  
Ricochet you take your aim  
Fire away fire away  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
You shoot me down but I won't fall  
I am titanium  
  
I am titanium  
I am titanium
When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul

Well I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up still looking up

Well I won't give up on us no I'm not giving up
God knows I'm tough enough I am tough I am loved
We've got a lot to learn we're alive we are loved
God knows we're worth it and we're worth it

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it

No I won't give up

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up still looking up

Well I won't give up on us no I'm not giving up
God knows I'm tough enough I am tough I am loved
We've got a lot to learn we're alive we are loved
God knows we're worth it and we're worth it

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
If you ever leave me baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have we don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor Ooh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain rain rain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh if I was in their shoes I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' "There goes my little girl walkin' with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yeah for you I'll try I'll try I'll try I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain rain rain
Oh don't just say Don't just say goodbye Goodbye
Don't just say Don't just say goodbye Goodbye
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain rain rain

Yeah you the one yeah I'ma tell it like it is
No matter what you done yeah I'ma tell you like it is
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said "Baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin' hustlin' before you met your husband"
Then I said "What if Mary was in the club
Before she met Joseph around hella thugs"
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
What if Mary was Mary J Blige
What if Beyoncé was actually light
What if you ain't never had the power
To make a nigga feel power
White Ferrari in a showroom
Hopin' they don't catch me 'cause I'm DUI
One more "I love you" and I said "Why"

That I had it then you came to my senses

Hey walkin' through the door I know you're lookin' at me
But you ain't got nothin' on me well technically

With a dead stopwatch clockin' my style
They tryna copy my swagger I'm on that next shit now
I'm so three thousand and eight you so two thousand and late
I got that boom boom boom that future boom boom boom

Let's go
Verse 1:
You know I'm not one to break promises
I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe
At the end of it all you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release
Which way is right which way is wrong
How do I say that I need to move on
You know we're headed separate ways

Chorus:
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

Verse 2:
You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's oh so much that you deserve
Nothing to say nothing to do
I've nothing to give I must live without you
You know we're headed separate ways

Chorus:
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

Bridge:
So I'll be on my way
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself

Chorus:
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me


This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no


I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
'Cause you ripped me off your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep and you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me


This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no


Now look at me I'm sparkling
A firework a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowin' oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothin' anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah yeah except for me


This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no hey
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me no
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh Uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean don't it
Washed it the other day watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

Hey hey hey
Rollin' up a J of that Cheba
And we layin' back
In the cut like we don't give a fuck
We're just tryna catch a nut

Make you take a seat
Oh baby go and take a seat
And I'll come smoke one with you
You'll be blowin' O's impressin' me
Go and take a shot
Oh baby go and take a shot
And I'll be tipsey too
And I'll be messin' with you

We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh and I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac

Blowin' everywhere we goin'
And now you knowin'
When I step right up
Getting out of the car
Shit don't even gotta close my door
I'mma roll up toke up
And blow her mind

And now she's movin'
Slow motion
Feels like ocean
And I'm coastin'
Time slows down pupil's growin'
Strong as fuck but I'm flowing
Beginnin' to feel like I'm sinking
Floatin' body's feelin' warm and
I don't know where the hell I am at
Someplace between smoking and relaxin'
Ooh ooh

This is for the hoes
This is for the weed
This is for the ones who never
Switch up on me
This is for the ones
Who keep it player
Hopin' that the Lord take care
Of all of their fears
And they haters

So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying this is it I've had enough 'cause like
We haven't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space what
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
We called it off again last night
But ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
This time I'm telling you I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You called me up again tonight
But ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
This time I'm telling you I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never
Huh so he calls me up and he's like I still love you
And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting you know like
We are never getting back together like ever

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We are not getting back together
We are not getting back together
But we oh we oh we oh we oh we
We are not getting back together
But we oh we oh we oh we oh we
We are not getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

"Moves Like Jagger" by Maroon 5 featuring Christina Aguilera:


Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right then aim for my heart
If you feel like it take me away
And make it okay I swear I'll behave


You wanted control so we waited
I put on a show now we're naked
You say I'm a kid my ego is big
I don't give a shit and it goes like this


Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger


I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger


I got the moves like Jagger
I got the moves like Jagger
I got the moves like Jagger


Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you ooh oh
Kiss me 'til you're drunk
And I'll show you ooh oh
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger


You wanna know how to make me smile
Take control own me just for the night
But if I share my secret
You gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this


Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger"
All right Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Blow Me One Last Kiss" by Pink:


White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying I've been crying
I've been dying over you

Tie a knot in the rope
Trying to hold trying to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us

Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of s*** 
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse

I've had a s*** day you've had a s*** day
We've had a s*** day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this 

Blow me one last kiss 

I won't miss all of the fighting that we always did
Take it in I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick whiskey d***s no more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick 'cause you'll no longer sleep
I'll dress nice I'll look good I'll go dancing alone
I'll laugh I'll get drunk I'll take somebody home 

I think I've finally had enough 
I think I maybe think too much 
I think this might be it for us 

Blow me one last kiss 

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of s***
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss 

Just when it can't get worse 

I've had a s*** day you've had a s*** day
We've had a s*** day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss 
I think I've had enough of this 

Blow me one last kiss 

Blow me one last kiss 

I will do what I please anything that I want
I will breathe I will breathe I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins you'll be sorry my dear
All the lies all the why's will all be crystal clear 

Blow me one last kiss 

I think I've finally had enough 
I think I maybe think too much 
I think this might be it for us 

Blow me one last kiss 

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of s***
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss 

Just when it can't get worse 

I've had a s*** day you've had a s*** day
We've had a s*** day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss 
I think I've had enough of this 

Blow me 

One last kiss
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time

Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Stood there naked the sun's up I'm a mess
Gotta get out now gotta run from this
Here comes the shame here comes the shame

1 2 3 4
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time

Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time

At least we now know that we are not alone
There's a few of us making a stand
And holding back tears while we're holding our beers
I'll cheers to my brothers and sisters afar

Hold on tight it's a roller coaster ride we're on
As off the edge we peer
I'll scream my lungs out 'til there's no sound left
So here's to living in the moment

Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time

Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time

We don't even have to try it's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time

1 2 3 4
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time

Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
Now here we are
So close yet so far haven't I passed the test
When will you realize
Baby I'm not like the rest

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to waste to waste
So let me give your heart a break give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break your heart a break

Oh yeah yeah

On Sunday you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone my love
But you did not reply
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to waste to waste
So let me give your heart a break give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break your heart a break

There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break

Oh yeah yeah

When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run whoa
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake whoa
There's just one life to live one life to live
And there's no time to waste to waste
So let me give your heart a break give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break your heart a break

Oh yeah yeah

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong

Ball so hard this shit weird

Psycho I'm liable to be go Michael

Ball so hard got a broke clock Rollies that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard I'm shocked too I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped you'd be in Paris getting fucked up too

Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me

Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray that shit cray that shit cray

Come and meet me in the bathroom stall"
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard that shit cray ain't it Jay

Your whip so cold this old thing
Act like you'll ever be around mothafuckas like this again
Bougie girl grab her hand

Excuse my French but I'm in France I'm just sayin'
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
'Cause I was him I woulda married Kate & Ashley

Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me y'all know

Photo shoot fresh looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh live from the Mercer run up on Yeezy the wrong way I might murk ya
Flee in the G450 I might surface
Political refugee asylum can be purchased
Uh everything's for sale I got 5 passports I'm never going to jail
I made Jesus walks I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow it's never going on sale
Luxury rap the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance write my curses in cursive
I get it custom you a customer
You ain't customed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere huh
And all the ladies in the house got them showing off
I'm done I hit ya up manana I'm done

Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me y'all know
That shit cray that shit cray that shit cray
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me y'all know
That shit cray that shit cray that shit cray

Summer after high school when we first met
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th Birthday
We got matching tattoos


Used to steal your parents' liquor
And climb to the roof
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue


Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
The one that got away


I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on


Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse


Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
The one that got away


All this money can't buy me a time machine
No I can't replace you with a million rings
No I should've told you what you meant to me whoa
'Cause now I pay the price


In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
The one that got away
The one that got away
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

Nevermind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over

Nevermind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"

Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste

Nevermind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"

Nevermind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
Verse 1:
I see you over there so hypnotic
Thinkin' 'bout what I'd do to that body
I'll getchu like ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby

Got no drink in my hand but I'm wasted
Gettin' drunk off the thought of you naked
I'll getchu like ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby baby

Pre-Chorus:
And I've tried to fight it to fight it
But you're so magnetic magnetic
Got one life just live it just live it
Now relax and get on your back

Chorus:
If you wanna scream yeah let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ah-ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna scream yeah let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ah-ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby

Verse 2:
You don't have to say my name
Girl I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here now
You'll leave me broken
Shattered I lie
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you

Chorus:
If you wanna scream yeah let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ah-ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby
Ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna scream yeah let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ah-ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby

Bridge:
I'm what you want I'm what you need
He got you trapped I'll set you free
Sexually mentally physically emotionally
I'll be like your medicine you'll take every dose of me
It's going down on aisle three I'll bag you like some groceries
And every time you think of me I know you're gonna wanna go see me

Chorus:
If you wanna scream yeah let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ah-ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby
If you wanna scream yeah let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ah-ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby ah-ooh baby baby ooh baby

Outro:
I'll get you going oh baby I'll get you going
Oh baby baby baby ooh baby baby baby

Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
I know you gotta clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin' rock it up on the floor

If you're a criminal kill it on the floor
Mattress on fire we hit the floor
Don't stop keep it movin' put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor

Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running sh*t tonight on the floor
Brazil Morocco London to Ibiza
Straight to LA New York Vegas to Africa


Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody drink a little more

La la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor


I know you got it clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin' rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor on the floor

Don't stop keep it movin' put your drinks up
It's getting ill it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong we probably die on the floor

Brazil Morocco London to Ibiza
Straight to LA New York Vegas to Africa


Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody drink a little more

La la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Hold on to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave is stringing us along

Just know you're not alone
Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Settle down it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons that fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost you can always be found

Just know you're not alone
Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Ooo-oo-oo-oo-ooh    Ooo-oo-oo-oo-ooh

Settle down it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons that fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost you can always be found

Just know you're not alone
Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Ooo-oo-oo-oo-ooh    Ooo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
"Ass Back Home" by Gym Class Heroes featuring Neon Hitch:

Oh it’s so sexy yo
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something outta nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It’s like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long that was last November
Now December's almost gone and I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't sick of this but it’s the job of my dreams
So then what the hell is wrong
I’m just trying to be honest I’m not in denial
I know I’ve been distant I’ve been away for a while
But I miss you I miss you what more can I say
I'm dying to feel your touch to have your kiss
To have your way where are you now
I don’t know where you're going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know where you're going
Just get your ass back home
This is the same old song that I always sing
I know the way I know the game I know the industry
And I'm hoping that you'll listen when I speak
Honestly we'll be ok if you don't leave
Dude I forgot to tell you something important
To some of the people listening I think I might sound pompous
But to the ones who understand I’m trying to progress
Sincerely I'm a work in progress so many questions

I'm afraid of the outcome procrastination is an enemy to ambition
We all know that line “If you want to make God laugh tell him about your plans”
So now I’m on stage it's a sacrifice every night
My imagination's in a cage locked up without a light
But you can get it all if you give me one night
I’mma give it to you give it to you like I only know how
We been down this road now I'm back it’s on the right route
But the same old fears are still here if you're wondering I'm still here
I'm a work in progress pitiful isn't it
I know who I am but who are you
You're not looking for me I’m not looking for you
But if by chance we happened to cross paths
I wouldn't let you go I'd be like “Hold me back”
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going
Just get your ass back home
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Wanted" by Hunter Hayes:

You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted

Anyone can tell you you're pretty yeah
And you get that all the time I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the make-up
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need you're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah I wanna make you feel wanted

Baby I wanna make you feel wanted
You'll always be wanted
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Drunk on You" by Luke Bryan:

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset riverside four wheel drives
In a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party started

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make me just gotta get a taste
Lips like Jack and Diane hot as hell couldn't wanna raise ya
Been hooked on you since the day I met you
I'm so addicted to ya I'ma wanna do it again

Oh yeah ass up head down laying the bed
and even though we ain't got no money
I'm so in love with ya honey
Everything'll bring a chainsaw to the county line
Ain't nothing gonna knock this off this cloud I'm on
I'm drunk on you and high on summertime

I am smoking on that gas life should be on Cinemax
Movie bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he's not I I smoke strong that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives black diamonds apartheid
Bread up and my top down
On the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block out
Take ya ass on a vacay
Say she too young won't thirty her
I'm bleeping her and her sister
I don't know what's gotten into me
My hands is on fire I feel like Diddy


I'm on fire I'm on fire
I'm on fire I'm on fire
I'm on fire I'm on fire
If niggas won't beef we can turn it to a barbecue
Block parties in the projects I'm talking 'bout the ones I'm on top of V12 with the top off
I'm on that Reebok shit I may never take them off
I'm about to go off I'm on that fu*k sh*t
I'm with some hood sh*t I'm on that fu*k sh*t
My Rolex broke that don't mean I'm time-less
You don't know what we've been through and you can never feel my pain
Been living in the fast lane can't complain we're on the same yacht
Got two custom Glocks that bitch is ducking shots
Got a sign on my dick bad bitches only
Got my niggas with me and they came with all their homies
We walk in the building and they're spraying at the ceiling
I'm with Mr Sippin' Cognac and here's a message to you rappers
Niggas bragging about their bread nigga we gettin' too much
I'm on that good kush and alcohol I got some down bitches I can call


I am smoking on that gas life should be on Cinemax
Movie bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he's not I I smoke strong that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives black diamonds apartheid
Bread up and my top down
On the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block out
Take ya ass on a vacay
Say she too young won't thirty her
I'm bleeping her and her sister
I don't know what's gotten into me
My hands is on fire I feel like Diddy


Thrilling hurting feelings she was praying would soon stop
The point guards are sweating seems like we're in a hoop-op
I bought my life a mattress it's safe to say I'm on top
Life is just a race and I'm trying to keep pace but
I turned right when I should've turned left I should've known better
Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg
Started off as a "Dime" piece then upgrades to a "Twenty"
The **** we smoking on private location
I probably shouldn't be driving apparitions of the Devil
Tryna make an honest living should I take what I'm given
And you're giving too many stares Who's hot as me
Really looking like you're scared I ain't trying to give 'em nightmares
I'm stuck in the six I guess you moved to Atlanta
I'm never gon' stop show them your crib and drive 'em bananas
You're doing circus acts let's take them to the circus
Alright alright
I'm smoking louder and I'm laughing harder
The game's over you **** with the Waste Management
We rich already and my chick the baddest
I'm hitting bongs on the table like it's ping pong


I am smoking on that gas life should be on Cinemax
Movie bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he's not I I smoke strong that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives black diamonds apartheid
Bread up and my top down
On the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block out
Take ya ass on a vacay
Say she too young won't thirty her
I'm bleeping her and her sister
I don't know what's gotten into me
My hands is on fire I feel like Diddy
Ohhh
Uh

Hey boy you never had much game
So I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away-way-way

Now I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns clowns

Remember all the things that you and I did first
And now you're doing them with her
You got me got me like this

Uh And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went come on
She's getting the very best of you
Is there nothing that I can do
To make you want me love me and cherish me like you did before

I gave you all I had
But you gave me nothing oh
Now the tables have turned and I'll survive
I'm over the curve oh

The look's on your face when you see her around
My heart it sinks and hits the ground
Giving you tears honey that's rich
She's like a oh whatever
You can keep the bitch but if it were me
I'd rather be with nobody than somebody who loves me but hurts me constantly


Uh 'Cause I'm all alone ain't got nobody
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
And I steal some of his clothes
Let's be clear won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I wanna want you when you're gone

'Cause I got somebody else uh
You had your chance to find somebody better but you blew it
I'm sorry I'm the one that cheated but I was lonely
And he looked at me the way you should've
But she ain't him ain't got a ooh
How can I replace you boy eh
If I'm never gonna meet nobody like you
I'm never going to meet nobody like you-ouou uh

And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went come on boy
She's getting the very best of you
Is there nothing that I can do
To make you want me love me and cherish me like you did before

I gave you all I had
But you gave me nothing oh oh
Now the tables have turned and I'll survive
I'm over the curve oh

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo 
Wake me up up up up up up 


I don't wanna fall asleep
I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married start a family watch your husband with his son


I wish that I could wake up to the sound of the phone
Ringing kissing you instead of missing you
Yeah yeah yeah
What I wouldn't give to kiss you one last time yeah
I wish that I could look into your eyes
Saying goodbye you were the one that got away
Yeah yeah woah-oh-oh-oh-oh


I'll always love you from afar
'Cause I know you've gotta start your life and make a family
But I hope you think of me in times of tragedy
'Cause I believed in you you believed in me
But darling this is goodbye
Until the morning just sleep tight


I wish that I could wake up to the sound of the phone
Ringing kissing you instead of missing you
Yeah yeah yeah
What I wouldn't give to kiss you one last time yeah
I wish that I could look into your eyes
Saying goodbye you were the one that got away
Yeah yeah woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

With regret in my heart
And ice in my veins
I don't wanna let it die
But we can't go back in time


I wish that I could wake up to the sound of the phone
Ringing kissing you instead of missing you
Yeah yeah yeah

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades store-bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm On Fire and Born To Run
You looked at me and I was done
We were just getting started

I was singin' to you you were singin' to me
I was so alive never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oooh oooh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn’t care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
Baby is a selfless thing
Satin sheets  a preacher’s ring
Sky high in Colorado
Springsteen Springsteen

I opened up my wallet
And an old hotel key fell out
I don't wanna it but I keep
Just incase incase I might need it still
Holdin' onto the memory
Holdin' onto the memory of
When you were singin' to me
I was singin' to you
You were singin' to me
And I was singin' to you
I was singin' to you you were singin' to me
I was so alive never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oooh oooh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen Springsteen

Dreams that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio
Hope hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation
I know that much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm still in love with you
And I'm not over you

Damn damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent

I I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me

But I'm not even close without you
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm still in love with you
And I'm not over you

Not over you
Not over you
And I'm not over you
Not over you
And I'm still thinking 'bout you
I'm still thinking 'bout you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm still in love with you
And I'm not over you

Not over you
Not over you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I asked you to scratch my back could you manage that
Like yeahey dizzle it's me and my cap
And to the beat I'll whack your mattress
Quick then in slow more than you'll ever know
Ahh my songs know what you did in the dark
So light up my cigarettes and let me be your spark
The jocks buzzin' fresh it's so contag
Oh boy it's nasty big and hefty
And oh boy I'm lucky you with me
Oh I'm like a lollipop you can lick me twist me dip me I play the part

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo
Let's go

If I was an old-school fifty-pound boombox remember them
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase Mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it sing along and take me by the hand
Keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo
I put those headphones on
Cause songs like this
That's remind me of you now
Now I created a playlist
For us to grow old to
And girl if you're wondering
If I want you to
I want you to

So make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo
Let's go

¡Come on

I want to everybody out there

To know that we're coming back in time

¡Let's go

This for everybody going through a struggle

Believe me been there done that

But everyday above ground is a great day remember that

I'm out the door it's time to go

You'll be amazed at what you find

The more that you look the more that you know

Don't trip let it rip let's go

¡Oh oh wo oh oh

Back in time

¡Oh oh wo oh oh

Back in time

¡Oh oh wo oh oh

Back in time

¡Never look back

¡Oh oh wo oh oh

I'm Lyrically Blessed

When the light comes on my dreams catch fire

And I take this opportunity to fuel the fire

I'm riding in my Chevy it's sitting too high

But I'm feeling like I'm flying up above the sky

I'm getting attention but that's not what I crave

I'm feeling the heat and I'm feeling the rage

Everything I do I do it for the thrill

I'm chasing the night I'm living without fear

I'm out the door it's time to go

You'll be amazed at what you find

The more that you look the more that you know

Don't trip let it rip let's go

¡Oh oh wo oh oh

Back in time

¡Oh oh wo oh oh

Back in time

¡Oh oh wo oh oh

Back in time

¡Never look back

¡Oh oh wo oh oh

I'm Lyrically Blessed
She she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history or don't you remember
Sure she's got it all
But baby is that really what you want
Bless your soul you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And boy she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore
Rumour has it rumour repeatedly
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Good Girl" by Carrie Underwood:

Hey good girl hey good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you're thinkin' about
You'll see a good boy you'll see a good boy
Gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you cryin'
With your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey
But he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go
And throw away the key

Hey good girl hey good girl
Gettin' all dolled up
That dress ain't gonna get you
Into him or love
You're more than just a pretty face
Next time he tells you to change
Maybe you should tell him
To kiss off oh yeah
Pay attention to the warning signs
That's right
'Cause girl you deserve nothing but the best
You're beautiful the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing

Hey good girl hey good girl
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding
And a hand you can hold
Just like a should-be husband
Ain't that the reason you're at this club
You ain't gonna find Mr Right
Dancin' with ya
And the funny thing about it is
I could've told you
That he'd never buy
You that drink hmm

Pay attention to the warning signs
That's right
'Cause baby you deserve nothing but the best
You're beautiful the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
Yeah

You don't have to change
You don't have to change a thing
Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the AstroTurf
Get yourself a coozie let's go

Who said anything about skiing
Floating is all I want to do
You can climb the ladder just don't rock the boat
While I barbecue

On the pontoon makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion out here in the open
Mmm-mmm-mmm motorboatin'

Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black inner tube

On the pontoon makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion out here in the open
Mmm-mmm-mmm motorboatin'

On the pontoon
Mmm-mmm-mmm
On the pontoon

Back this hitch up into the water
Thirty feet or so take a few strokes
Slip on your sunscreen you've been havin' too much fun and
But don't you worry don't you worry don't you worry

On the pontoon makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' out the back don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion I'm out here in the open
Mmm-mmm-mmm motorboatin'

On the pontoon
Mmm-mmm-mmm
On the pontoon
Verse 1:
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Bridges she burned
Light nowhere to turn
But darkness still overtook her
She questioned her fate
Verse 2:
The islands said "Come to me
Love is all you need
Love is all you need"
The islands were wrong
To her love was just a song
A melody she thought
That she would never feel
So she turned off her mind
And disconnected her heart
Verse 3:
So we live in paradise
But we feel like prisoners
Yes we live in paradise
But we're dying inside
In times of trouble we'll be all right
In times of trouble we'll be all right
Chorus:
But this could be paradise
We're living in a hopeless world
And we're fighting for our lives
But nobody's perfect
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's not too late
It's not too late
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless I can't help feeling
We could have had it all

You're gonna wish you never had met me
We could have had it all
You're gonna wish you never had met me
It all it all it all

You're gonna wish you never had met me
We could have had it all
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Rolling in the deep

You're gonna wish you never had met me
We could have had it all
You're gonna wish you never had met me
You're gonna wish you never had met me
We could have had it all
You're gonna wish you never had met me

Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby oh

And maybe some time

'Cause the way you walked away

I Know you want it in the worst way
I Wanna hear you calling my name

"50 Ways to Say Goodbye" by Train:

Just some chords on an old guitar
A couple of verses from a couple of bars
Heres a little tune for you
To make you feel nice

When youre lonely and your heart is feeling cold
Just remember that one more time
You can go your own way

50 ways to say goodbye

She said "It's not you it's me"
I'm afraid it's plain to see
When it comes to love I'm no match for your imagery"

So I've found a place where we can settle down
And you can be the mayor I'll be the clown
We'll keep our love affair strictly underground

Well I tried to imagine a scenario
Where that was just a pack of lies
But my Imagination didn't have to grow
Cause I just heard you say goodbye

Whoa oh oh I'll never hear them the same way again
Whoa oh oh you and your heart shouldn't feel so bad
You and your heart shouldn't feel so bad

50 ways to say goodbye"
Now red solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues tailgates fairs and festivals
And you sir do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinkin' from glass
Hey red solo cup is cheap and disposable
In fourteen years they are decomposable
And unlike my home they are not foreclosable
Freddie Mac can kiss my ass woo
Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party
Now I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well that my friends is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them to help me get lucky
Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party
Now I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you red will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott into my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
Red solo cup you're more than just plastic
More than amazing you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say:
"Red solo cup you are not just a cup
No no no you're my friend yoo-hoo
Red solo cup you're more than just a cup
You're ahh ahh yeah yeah yeah
Red solo cup I fill you up
Let's have a party let's have a party
I love you red solo cup I lift you up
Proceed to party proceed to party"
Verse 1:
It's been said and done every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on with the best of 'em

A centerfold miracle lyrical
You saved my life again and I want you to know baby

Chorus:
I I love you like a love song baby

I I love you like a love song baby
And I keep hittin' re-pea-pea-pea-pea-pea-peat

It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you it just fits perfectly
Every second every thought I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face
But we know this we got a love that is homeless

Chorus:
I I love you like a love song baby
I I love you like a love song baby
I I love you like a love song baby
And I keep hittin' re-pea-pea-pea-pea-pea-peat

A song that goes on and on

Chorus:

And I keep hittin' re-pea-pea-pea-pea-pea-peat

Heartbeats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

One step closer
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Been goin' round and round all day
Bailin' some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to set
Roll into town shine the old truck up

Swing by the Quick Stop grab a little something to

Drink down a little cold one
Better get ready for the night


My kind of town the party don't stop
'Til the break of dawn let's take a little ride
Out where the corn rows grow close our eyes and let it go
Country down a little road let's see where it goes


We can dip on in to the river
Dip our toes in the water and we'll never
Know how long they've been sittin' there
Probably some 3-day old Corona

I'm cool with anything we can go as far as you wanna
'Cause every inch of your skin is a holy grail I wanna worship
Take it easy baby I'm an outlaw
Got my hand on my pistol I'm listenin' to the whistle


My kind of town the party don't stop
'Til the break of dawn let's take a little ride
Out where the corn rows grow close our eyes and let it go
Country down a little road let's see where it goes


Life's just a radio turn up the song
Come on baby sing along
We'll buy a some boat and float down in the holler
'Cause that's how we do it in the land of the water


My kind of town the party don't stop
'Til the break of dawn let's take a little ride
Out where the corn rows grow close our eyes and let it go
Country down a little road let's see where it goes

You-ou-ou-ou-ou

Don't wanna leave it; let's run away

Won't you come over baby we can align

Mr Worldwide let's ride

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check


I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night


It's time to begin isn't it
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am


So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check


I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night


It's time to begin isn't it
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin isn't it
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am


This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes to ashes


It's time to begin isn't it
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin isn't it
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright tonight
You and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Hard to Love" by Lee Brice:

I am insensitive I have a tendency
To pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink 'til it's down to the bottom
And wake up early to black coffee and green tea

"Hard to love
Hard to love
Oh I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love
And you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me"

I am a short fuse I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus
And I wish that I could be more like you

"Hard to love
Hard to love
Oh I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love
And you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me"

Love me love me girl
Oh you love me love me girl

"Hard to love
Hard to love
Oh I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love
And you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me"
Ain't nothing 'bout a track

Sitting in the bed of his Chevy

On a blanket looking up at the sky

That's a hundred thousand stars tonight

In a world of buzzing neon lights

It's funny how quiet the country sounds

When you're lying on your back

Looking up at the moon and the midnight clouds

Out in the country down the dirt road

That's where we found a place of our own

Yeah we own the night

Oh yeah feels so right

Got the radio up and the tailgate down

Just me and my boys hanging out

Six-pack of beer and a fifth of good Crown

Ain't no worries just hanging out

Down in the country

Yeah down in the country

Ride down here with the windows rolled down

Got enough beer and we don't need nothing else

Out in the country down the dirt road

That's where we found a place of our own

Yeah we own the night

Oh yeah feels so right

When the sun goes down stars come out

Ain't nothing 'bout a track

Sitting in the bed of his Chevy

On a blanket looking up at the sky

That's a hundred thousand stars tonight

These lips
Can't wait to taste your skin baby
No no


I'll make you beg for it
Until you feel like you breathe for it
I'll give you love if you you say that is right
If all that you do is give me life
Oh oh oh


Baby these fists will always protect ya lady
And this mind oh will never neglect you yeah baby
Oh baby  Let my love let my love adorn you
Ah le-le-le-let it just adorn you
You gotta know you gotta know
You know that I adore you
Yeah baby


Baby these eyes will watch you for eternity yeah baby
And these lips ah will kiss ya oh so tenderly yeah baby
Oh baby yeah Let my love let my love adorn you
Ah le-le-le-let it just adorn you
You gotta know you gotta know
Know that I adorn you


Just that baby
So now you kiddin' with the best
Lemme fly you out to Geneva
Shopping sprees in Italy I'll  one
Of your friends more than attention
Ain't gotta pay for it you my boo
Now that's the real definition of a boss
Nana ain't trippin' if you ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin' let you know boss
Lemme show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doing that thing over there
Shawty we gon' do it like this
In honor of the groove


Baby these fists will always protect ya lady
And this mind oh will never neglect you yeah baby
Oh baby let my love let my love let my love adorn you
Le-le-le-let it just adorn you
You gotta know you gotta know
Know that I adore you
Just that babe ooh
A couple guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killin' time
Flirting with the flight attendants

Thirty thousand feet above could be Oklahoma
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man it all looks the same miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd wanna live down there in the middle of nowhere

They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those fly over states

I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a three-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first-class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
Where the windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolor painted sky
You'd think heaven's doors have opened

You'll understand why God made
Those fly over states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
Meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
Those fly over states

Have you ever been to Indiana
Seen the fall at Gatlinburg
Met a girl from Auburn Alabama
You'll understand why God made
Those fly over states

I think that's pretty fly
The cycle repeated
as explosions broke in the sky
all that I needed
was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
waiting to let me know

We're building it up
to break it back down
we're building it up
to burn it down
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
as the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this/
but couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were caught at the turn
caught in the burning glow

And I was there at the turn
waiting to let you know

We're building it up
to break it back down
we're building it up
to burn it down
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground

You told me yes you held me high
and I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier you played king
and struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
so when you fall I'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn

We're building it up
to break it back down
we're building it up
to burn it down
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground

When you fall I'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground
oh whoa
we can't wait
to burn it to the ground
oh whoa
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me 'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger stronger
Just me myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking 'bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger stronger
Just me myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking 'bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end
I let it fall my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win


But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win


But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt somethin' die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for ya
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for ya

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt somethin' die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time oh oh

Let it burn oh
Let it burn
Let it burn
Yeah

When I walk on by girls be lookin' like "Damn he fly"
I pay to the beat walking on the street with in my new La Freak yeah
This is how I roll animal print pants outta control
It's Redfoo with the big afro
And like Bruce Leroy I got the glow
Glide through the crowd and I'm real low key
I'm like a new kid mixed with a-z-a-y
Sorry for party rocking step up to the scene 'cause my team's on the scene
Start off with a shot 'cause I'm grabbing my drink
I got a robbed-out VW I can sell you in sight
So when I'm warnin' baby you know what I mean
I'm sexy and I know it

I'm sexy and I know it x2

Yeah when I'm at the mall security just can't fight them off
When I'm at the beach I'm in a Speedo tryna tan my cheeks yeah
This is how I roll come on ladies it's time to go
We headed to the bar baby don't be nervous
No shoes no shirt and I still get service
Watchin' MTV cops is the thing the round cops complain I'm disturbin' their peace
This is how I roll animal print pants outta control
It's Redfoo with the big afro
And like Bruce Leroy I got the glow

Oh oh Girl look at that body
Oh oh Girl look at that body
Oh oh Girl look at that body
I-I-I work out

Oh oh Girl look at that body
Oh oh Girl look at that body
Oh oh Girl look at that body

When I walk in the spot this is what I see
Everybody stops and they starin' at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it show it show it

I'm sexy and I know it x4

Yeah yeah
You and I go hard at each other like we’re going to war  
You and I go rough we keep throwing things and slamming the doors  
You and I get so damn dysfunctional we stopped keeping score  
You and I get sick yeah I know that we can’t do this no more  

But baby there you go again there you go again making me love you  
Yeah I stopped using my head using my head let it all go  
Got you stuck on my body on my body like a tattoo  
And now I’m feeling stupid feeling stupid crawling back to you  

So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I’ll only stay with you one more night  
And I know I said it a million times  
But I’ll only stay with you one more night  

Try to tell you no but my body keeps on telling you yes  
Try to tell you stop but your lipstick got me so out of breath  
I’ll be waking up in the morning probably hating myself  
And I’ll be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell  

But baby there you go again there you go again making me love you  
And I stopped using my head using my head let it all go  
Got you stuck on my body on my body like a tattoo  
And now I’m feeling stupid feeling stupid crawling back to you  

So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I’ll only stay with you one more night  
And I know I said it a million times  
But I’ll only stay with you one more night  

Yeah baby give me one more night  
Oh baby give me one more night  
Yeah baby give me one more night  

But baby there you go again there you go again making me love you  
Yeah I stopped using my head using my head let it all go  
Got you stuck on my body on my body like a tattoo  
And now I’m feeling stupid feeling stupid crawling back to you  

So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I’ll only stay with you one more night  
And I know I said it a million times  
But I’ll only stay with you one more night  

Yeah baby give me one more night one more night  
Yeah baby give me one more night oh yeah yeah  
Yeah baby give me one more night  

So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I’ll only stay with you one more night  
So I cross my heart and I hope to die  
That I’ll only stay with you one more night
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to West LA or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me
Oh but that one night was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you
Oh I swear to you I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y
Oh oh oh
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me mm mm
Way you do me oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y
Oh oh oh
On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip to how you've been
And get down to the more than friends at last
Oh but that one night is still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you
Oh I swear to you I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y
Oh oh
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Way you do me oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y
Oh oh oh
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y

Roll down the window and they ask me “what's your name”
And my dick size can you predict mine
If I told you Cole a Gemini would you check for me
And if I told you I was duckin' down for protection would you respect it
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it


I'm just tryna' get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential

Tryna' keep it up don't seem so simple


I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo


Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all my idols got me signin' endorsements
And back home I'm known as a hero
And everyday I hear a new freakin' rumor
They be talkin' 'bout me like I'm new to the money
I guess I'm new to the money 'cause the offers keep on comin'


I'm just tryna' get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin' sent your friends home
Keep on tryna' hide it but your friends know

Tryna' keep it up don't seem so simple


I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo

I can provide the lyrics of "Climax" by Usher without any censorship labels additional commentary or information


Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back it's too late we've reached the climax climax


I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud that keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees but it seems we're

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back it's too late we've reached the climax climax


I've given everything but it's still not enough
Is it too late now to say sorry
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body oh
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now


Thoughts racing fast
I've reached the climax
We're together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back it's too late we've reached the climax climax


I gave my best it wasn't enough
You get upset we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care I care at all at all at all at all


Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back it's too late we've reached the climax climax


I've given everything but it's still not enough
Is it too late now to say sorry
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now


Thoughts racing fast
I've reached the climax
We're together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back it's too late we've reached the climax climax


We're together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back it's too late we've reached the climax climax
 
Work hard play hard 
 
Work hard play hard 
Work hard play hard 
We work hard play hard 
Keep partyin' like it's your job 
 
Somebody take me back to the days 
Before this was a job before I got paid 
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank 
Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at Subway 
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it 
But now a days we rappin' to stay relevant 
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes 
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days 
Before the politics that we call the rap game 
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape 
And back before I tried to cover up my slang 
But this is for Decatur what's up Bobby Ray 
 
So can I get a wish to end the politics 
And get back to the music that started this shtick 
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape 
And back before the accolades the ad campaigns 
In back before I tried to cover up my slang 
Just listen to my shtick oh before we run out of time 
 
Here's to Champagne wishes and caviar dreams 
You deserve everything everything 
And if they try to slow you down 
Tell 'em all to go to hell 
 
 
Keep livin' reckless reckless 

Oh I know you're gettin' ready
I know you've got that dress on
Yeah the one you got for your birthday
That you wore when we first met
You're coming over you're coming over
You're coming over tonight
You're coming over you're coming over
You're coming over tonight
Lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
There's no hurry don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer let's go over
What I had in mind
Baby you know that you're the only one
That I wanna touch
I never knew that it could mean so much
So baby come on and
Say you will say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do say you don't
Baby don't you want to be mine
I gotta know I gotta know
Do you feel the same
Do you want me calling you mine
So baby come on and
Come over come over come over come over
Come over come over come over come over tonight
Come over come over come over come over
Come over come over come over come over tonight

So I took a few online quizzes
And got all A's
Now I'm talking to this abroad
She's in Boston but she say
She wanna fly out this way
We'll see well okay
Then she pulled up say "Goddamn you look great"
But I ain't here to conversate
I got other plans
Look at my watch yeah it's time to switch it up
Oh shit look at that
I got a missed call from my ex
I told her "Turn that shit off
Don't call me back send me a text"
I'm in the middle of a moment
With my undivided attention
And I don't want none of the drama
I just want a real good pretension
I wanna talk about your dreams
And all the things that you aspire to
I don't wanna reconvene
For the standards of a plaintiff
So if you tryna roll with me
You should know how to take direction
Pay attention it's worth it
You'll be looking at a legend
So good so good damn I'm so good
Got a whole band on my hand bitch I'm Thanos

Got 50 racks in a rubber band bitch I'm banded
So good so good damn I'm so good
Got a whole band on my hand bitch I'm Thanos

Got 50 racks in a rubber band bitch I'm banded
Hit the scene kush god supreme
Got a whole team phone ringing like ring-ring
We don't tap dance but my diamonds flash
Told her give me six inches make it a ski mask
I go hard in the booth biggie vibes give me the loot
New crib fuck a view paraplegic took the roof
I'm a celebrity I get words to the wise
I'm the wizard of Oz got a ice cold smile
Diamonds wet like the pool watery ways
I'm a dog off the leash I might put a dent in your cage
I'm a slave to the cheese your honor
I'm a thief in the night when I creep on piranhas
So good so good damn I'm so good
Got a whole band on my hand bitch I'm Thanos
I'm so good so good damn I'm so good
Got 50 racks in a rubber band bitch I'm banded
So good so good damn I'm so good
Got a whole band on my hand bitch I'm Thanos
I'm so good so good damn I'm so good
Got 50 racks in a rubber band bitch I'm banded

Give me a second to retrieve the lyrics Here are the uncensored lyrics of "We Are Young" by Fun featuring Janelle Monáe:

Give me a second I
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me
Just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses
Asking 'bout a scar and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a glass
'Cause I found someone to carry me home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Carry me home tonight Nananana
Just carry me home tonight Nananana
Carry me home tonight Nananana
Just carry me home tonight Nananana
The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh

If I took you home it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones wild ones wild ones
Oooh

I like crazy foolish stupid
Party going wild fist pumping
Music I might lose it
Blast to the roof that's how we do'z it do'z it do'z it
I don't care the night she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live ain't no surprise
Take me so high jumping those dives
Surfin' the crowd

Oooh

Said I gotta be the man
When they headin' my van might check one too
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it and y'all get lose lose
After bottle we all get bit and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto

Club shuts down a hundred super models
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh

If I took you home it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones wild ones wild ones
Oooh

Party rocker foot show stopper
More shampoo
Number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool no doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off then I make that move
Somehow someway gotta raise the roof roof

All black shades when the sun come through
Oh it's on like everything goes
Round up baby til the freaky show
What happens to that body it's a private show
Stays right here private show

I like em' untamed don't tell me how pain
Tell them this bottoms up with the champagne
My life coming harder than we hit play
Do you busy with the bail were you insane

Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh

If I took you home it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones wild ones wild ones
Oooh
I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Feel So Close" by Calvin Harris:

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal

Your love pours down on me
Surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal

Your love pours down on me
Surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal

Your love pours down on me
Surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

I feel so close to you right now
I feel so close to you right now

'Cause I ain't tryna control her

And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the club I make the club

Plus a pocket full of green
Hand full of money club don't close 'til I wanna leave
Wrist stay rock hard like it's filled up with gasoline

And I'm leanin' I'm about to fall

Same hood same style same drink nigga no tay-cup
'Cept I'm tippin' four fours
Feelin' like a four-door Maybach

Stack bread tall sip I'ma crawl
Let her get high sip syrup bitch sit down
Pop a seal twist it round we gon' get high
Hit the club know I'm tippin' twenty-four's

And I'ma beat the pussy up so vicious
She wanna have a nigga babies

Girl I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
This light up on this dusty street
Baby steps up in your truck and your opals on the floorboard
Seats leaned back a jukebox humming
Don't let that buzz kill loosen up your buttons
I know you're scared but you don't have to hide
Let's just give it a little time
If you don't then girl you're gonna miss out
On the only chance you'll ever have to find out
What it feels like when the world is yours
And your heart is pumping out a new beat
The stars are lining up yeah we're lining up
Yeah we're sipping on the cup of life
And tonight and we ain't gonna come down
No we ain't gonna come down
It's like can we see each other one more time
And not just kiss each other goodbye
See you when I see you
I'll be there when it's time to come back home
I don't want this night to end
It's closing time so leave with me again yeah
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You feel lWhen you're dancing cheek to cheek
Ain't no way to explain it how bad it needs
Gonna be this moment you and me
Skin to skin dancing in the dark
Your body's telling me you got heart
Well I just can't tell you apart tonight yeah yeah
Excuse me ma'am but I saw you walking in
I turned around I'm not a stalker
Where you going Maybe I can help you
My tank is full and I'd be obliged to take you
I don't want this night to end
It's closing time so leave with me again yeah
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You feel lWhen you're dancing cheek to cheek
Ain't no way to explain it how bad it needs
Gonna be this moment you and me
Skin to skin dancing in the dark
Your body's telling me you got heart
Well I just can't tell you apart tonight yeah yeah
Verse 1:
Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis all the way to rock and roll

Chorus:
Oh I can hear him now singing "Like a kid at the top of his lungs
I'm gonna give it all my might he's got dreams as big as Texas
And all his exes live in Texas"

Verse 2:
He headed out to Hollywood
Got a tattoo on his arm that says "baby"
He's been a cowboy he's been a rockstar
Ain't never given up

Chorus:
Oh I can hear him now singing "Like a kid at the top of his lungs
I'm gonna give it all my might he's got dreams as big as Texas
And all his exes live in Texas"

Bridge:
So keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
Keep on dreaming don't let it tear you apart
Even if it breaks your heart

Chorus:
Oh I can hear him now singing "Like a kid at the top of his lungs
I'm gonna give it all my might he's got dreams as big as Texas
And all his exes live in Texas"

Outro:
Keep on dreaming
Keep on dreaming

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two


Yeah I I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down


I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise


Uh uh yeah
She was standing there
Yellow in her hair
I couldn't help but stare
She'd beaming in the glare
Lips like a ribbon
Skin was soft as cotton
When I'm gone I hope she'll miss me
But for now I'm here for this money


Yeah I I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down


I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise


If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick


Yeah I I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down


I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise


I'm at a payphone

I'm wide awake x3
Yeah I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart I'm wide awake
How did I read the stars so wrong
I'm wide awake
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems


I'm wide awake
Yeah I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts you made it so sweet
Till I woke up on on the concrete
Chorus
Fallin' from cloud 9
crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah I'm falling from cloud 9 
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
Pick up every piece 
And land on my feet
I'm wide awake
Chorus
Verse 1: Drake

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine you've had yours we both know
We know they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still tears all in a pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that say you're done with that
On your face girl it just don't show
When you're ready just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow

Chorus: Rihanna & Drake

You won't ever have to worry you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
Cause if you let me here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

Verse 2: Drake

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine you've had yours we both know
We know you hate being alone
You ain't the only one you hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody should've told you somethin' to save you
Instead they say

Don't tell me I don't care
If you hurt I don't tell you
You don't care if you're true
Don't tell me I don't care
If you hurt I don't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Chorus: Rihanna & Drake

You won't ever have to worry you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
Cause if you let me here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

Outro: Rihanna

It's my birthday I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do you do

One time been in love one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though don't be so ashamed
I've had mine you've had yours we both know
We know you hate being alone
You ain't the only one you hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody should've told you somethin' to save you
Instead they say

Don't tell me I don't care
If you hurt I don't tell you
You don't care if you're true
Don't tell me I don't care
If you hurt I don't tell you
You don't care if you're true
Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick every board every slamming door flown away
'Til there's nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday

Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick every board every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday

Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick every board every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday

Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away

Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
All right here are the uncensored lyrics for "Domino" by Jessie J:

I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm about to explode

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Lights" by Ellie Goulding:

I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling calling calling me home
Calling calling calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Back to my corner coming my way to top me
Lightheadedness spinning my head is weak
Uh I'm not as lonely the screams all sound the same
And though the truth may vary this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey hey-ey-ey-ey

And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling calling calling me home
Calling calling calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

'Cause they're calling calling calling me home
Calling calling calling home
You show the lights
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
You shine it when I'm alone

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young


We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young


Youth is a state of mind it's not about a matter of time
It's okay to not be fine it's okay to not be alright
Don't give up it's your life love until you're alive
Don't lose your hope don't lose your drive
We're supposed to be free we're supposed to be wild


Let's forget about the sunrise
And leave the world behind until the daylight



We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young


I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young


Let's forget about the sunrise
And leave the world behind until the daylight



We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young


We were born to run born to run
Born to run through the night
We were born to run born to run



We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
