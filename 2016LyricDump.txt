For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own Well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on
But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on
But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love Now I fear nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time could someone call a referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness


I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me oh let me redeem oh redeem oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances


Yeah is it too late now to say sorry
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down is it too late to say I'm sorry now


I'm sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down is it too late to say I'm sorry now


I'm sorry yeah
Sorry oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down is it too late to say I'm sorry now


I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me oh let me redeem oh redeem oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot a second chances


Is it too late now to say sorry
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know oh I know
That I let you down oh
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

Baby I like your style


Grips on your waist
Front way back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
OT OT is never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray I pray


And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me


Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time


And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words

I wish I found some chords in an order that is new

I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink

But now I'm insecure and I care what people think

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young

How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from

I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it

Try to sell it never sell out of it I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother cause we have the same nose

Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam

But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered

Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend give each other different names

We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away

Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing in our face

Saying "Wake up you need to make money"

Yeah

We used to play pretend give each other different names

We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away

Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing in our face

Saying "Wake up you need to make money"

Yeah

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Hello it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing


Hello can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


There's such a difference between us
And a million miles


Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Once I was seven years old my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"
Once I was seven years old


It was a big big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure oh


Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely"
Once I was eleven years old


I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me


Once I was twenty years old my story got told
Before the morning sun when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old


I only see my goals I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later


Once I was twenty years old my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old


Soon we'll be thirty years old our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old


I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry


Soon I'll be sixty years old my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Mustard on the beat ho


I was good on my own that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit what the fuck you complaining for
Feeling jaded huh
Used to trip off that shit I was kicking to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you


But baby don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Trying to fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it


You needed me
Ooh you needed me
Feelin' like Rihanna bitch I need that distance
Ooh I know you see me I know you see me
I'm back did you miss me Miss me
I thought that we'd be better off alone
It ain't the first time believe me
And your bitch will never feel this feel this


Your bitch will never feel me huh
My pussy game just caught another body
Feelin' like I'm Illuminati I'm Illuminati
Got that satin 'round my waist I'm feelin' fly
Your man's been calling me "Mississippi" Mississippi
'Cause I ride that dick like a BMX
No nigga ever rode this huh
Ain't ever been afraid to let it show
You ain't ever been afraid to let it show


But baby don't get it twisted get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list hit list
Trying to fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine

I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober felt 10 years older
But fuck it it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs sad songs
Darling all I know are sad songs sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs sad songs
Darling all I know are sad songs sad songs

I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs sad songs
Darling all I know are sad songs sad songs

And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you oh oh
You oh oh you oh oh

Who knows why it's gotta be this way
We say nothing more than we need
I say "your place" when we leave

Baby this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you oh oh
You oh oh you oh oh

Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her

All my friends are heathens take it slow Wait for them
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think how'd I get here sitting next to you
But after all I've said please don't forget

All my friends are heathens take it slow Wait for them
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

You're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think "how did I get here sitting next to you"
But after all I've said please don't forget

Watch it watch it

All my friends are heathens take it slow Wait for them
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Wait for them to ask you who you know Watch it
All my friends are heathens take it slow Watch it
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Why'd you come you knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us
Climb on board
We'll go slow and high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

I'm seeing the pain seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you 'body but me 'body but us
Bodies together
I'd love to hold you close tonight and always
I'd love to wake up next to you

So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah reckless behaviour
A place that is so pure so dirty and raw
Be in the bed all day bed all day bed all day

Fucking you and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

It's our paradise and it's our war zone
Pillow talk
My enemy my ally
Prisoners
Then we're free it's a thriller
I'm seeing the pain seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you 'body but me 'body but us
Bodies together

I'd love to hold you close tonight and always
I'd love to wake up next to you
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah reckless behaviour
A place that is so pure so dirty and raw
Be in the bed all day bed all day bed all day

Fucking you and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
Pillow talk
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread gotta get you out of my head yeah
Needle and the thread gonna wind up dead yeah
Needle and the thread gotta get you out of my head get you out of my head
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees falling on my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches and I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches and I'll be needing stitches

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing


Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before


You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing


Ever since I left the city you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it you're so cold to me
I'd be lyin' if I said it wasn't gettin' to me
Yeah I know you say you're doin' you
But I heard from your friend that you've been foolin' 'round
I didn't know that your girl got a thing for me
So I'm just tryna do the right thing baby

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Used to always stay at home be a good girl
You was in a zone yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now you're someone else
Everybody gets high sometimes you know  
What else can we do when we're feeling low  
So take a deep breath and let it go  
You shouldn't be drowning on your own  

And if you feel you're sinking I will jump right over  
Into cold cold water for you  
And although time may take us into different places  
I will still be patient with you  

And I hope you know  
I won't let go  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
I won't let go  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  

Cause we all get lost sometimes you know  
It's how we learn and how we grow  
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old  
You shouldn't be fighting on your own  

And if you feel you're sinking I will jump right over  
Into cold cold water for you  
And although time may take us into different places  
I will still be patient with you  

And I hope you know  
I won't let go I won't let go no no no no no no  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
I won't let go  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  

Come on come on  
Save me from my rocking boat  
I just wanna stay afloat  
I'm all alone  
And I hope I hope  
Someone's gonna take me home  
Somewhere I can rest my soul  
I need to know  
You won't let go  

And if you feel you're sinking I will jump right over  
Into cold cold water for you  
And although time may take us into different places  
I will still be patient with you  
And I hope you know  
I won't let go I won't let go no no no no no no  
I'll be your lifeline tonight  
I won't let go  
I'll be your lifeline tonight
This is the uncensored lyrics of "Send My Love To Your New Lover" by Adele:


Just the guitar okay cool
This was all you none of it me
You put your hands on on my body and told me
Mmm told me you were ready
For the big one for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
Mmm that was what you told me


I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free-ee-e
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more


I was too strong you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising rising
Mmm baby I'm still rising
I was running you were walking
You couldn't keep up you were falling down down
Mmm there's only one way down


I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free-ee-e
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more


If you're ready if you're ready
If you're ready I am ready
If you're ready if you're ready send my love to your new lover
If you're ready are you ready
We both know we ain't kids no more


I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free-ee-e
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Taking it slow but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and it took him higher
Oh I'll be your daydream I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go
Deep in my bones I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on the couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop


I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can


I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do


I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can


Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down


I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can


Better than he can

Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you anymore

Completely focused my mind is open

Feeling used but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you ever see
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Competing with your charm
And the best parts of Mark
Got me twisted
Don't know what to do
I'm honestly too young to be this
Scared of losing you
I know that I've been foolish but
Lookin' through my window yeah
You know I'm big enough to admit that
I'm just a kid and I don't want no drama

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her you need her
And I'll never be her
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Here" by Alessia Cara:

I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance don't ask I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back please enjoy your party
I'll be here somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollerin' I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself what am I doin' here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossipin' 'bout her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up 'cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself what am I doin' here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout her haters she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin' awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself what am I doin' here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ooh
Oh oh oh oh ooh

Right my yiy just changed
You just buzzed the front gate
I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait
I made plans with you
And I won't let go
I'm a lover not a fighter
I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save save
All my love for you

I need to know where do I go
Cause I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

She said me I never seen you here before
You must've just moved to Palm Springs
kissin' out in public couldn't be ignored
Made me forget that we just met this week
Well I'm not complaining I'm just being honest
Take it how you want it
I'm just saying it's the shit
You whispered in my ear "Drake don't stop"
I love the way your breath feels on me it feels like

I need to know where do I go
Cause I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

People like to party
Not everyone oh Lord
Can you keep it up
I like your approach know that I'm feeling you
Know you respect me since you met me I thought that you were straight up
You look good and you're feeling yourself
Don't let that shit go to waste waste waste
I love the way you wine for me
Oh you look good and you're feeling yourself
Don't let that shit go to waste no no no

I need to know where do I go
Cause I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Gone been gone
I need to know where do I go
Cause I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

I found myself dreaming
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows we were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
I woke up in tears
With you by my side

A breath of relief
And I realized
No we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time so I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regrets

Let's take our time
To say what we want
Use what we got
Before it's all gone

'Cause no we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted

When we'll run out of time so I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

Superman got nothing on me

When you're feeling tired feeling low
When you're lost in the world been down the road
Don't know why but you're alone no more
Looking for a light in the dark you see
Can't do it on your own just let it be
Take a breath let it go
All of the hate that we hold inside
It's time to set it free
Take a breath let it go
All of the hurt that plays inside
It's time to set it free
When you're feeling tired feeling low
When you're lost in the world been down the road
Don't know why but you're alone no more
Looking for a light in the dark you see
Can't do it on your own just let it be
Take a breath let it go
All of the hate that we hold inside
It's time to set it free
Take a breath let it go
All of the hurt that plays inside
It's time to set it free
Take a breath let it go
All of the hate that we hold inside
It's time to set it free
Take a breath let it go
All of the hurt that plays inside
It's time to set it free

I used to be so happy
But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing


It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know
I'll never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die


Feeling it loving it
Everything that we do
And all along I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you


It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know
I'll never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die


I will keep you close forever
I'll be here remember
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you


It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know
I'll never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die
I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go never let me down
Don't you give up nah-nah-nah
I won't give up nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up nah-nah-nah
I won't give up nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby baby
Don't fall asleep
At the wheel we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go never let me down
Don't you give up nah-nah-nah
I won't give up nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up nah-nah-nah
I won't give up nah-nah-nah

We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do


I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on just the way you did so easily


Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh it's such a shame


We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do


I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason
That you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door


But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh it's such a shame


Ooh he's on your mind
I know we tried to forget
But between the wine and roses
And every note you wrote me
Ooh I I just can't let you go


Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh it's such a shame
Verse 1:
I'm so into you I can barely breathe

I'm still into you

Verse 2:
Recongnize la la la la
La la la la la
So come light me up so come light me up my baby
A little dangerous a little dangerous my baby mmm
A little less conversation and a little more "touch my body"
'Cause I'm so into you into you into you

Pre-chorus:
Hey baby this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you oh oh

Chorus:

Chorus:

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Gold" by Kiiara:


Gold up in my gold up in my teeth Gold up gold up in my teeth
Don't care what you say to me I'ma bite your feelings out Gold up in my teeth
I missed you in the basement Gold up in my teeth
But your brother was a good substitute for you


And if you love me love me but you never let me go
When the roof was on fire you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know


You're so gold golden
You're so golden


I'm out my head and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be


And if you love me love me but you never let me go
When the roof was on fire you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know


Golden golden golden golden
Golden golden golden golden


You're so golden
I'm out my head and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken


And if you love me love me but you never let me go
When the roof was on fire you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know


Golden golden golden golden You're so golden
Golden golden golden


You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
I'm happy that you're back and I'm happy that you're back I'm happy

This what happen when I think 'bout you
I get in my feelings yeah
I start reminiscin' yeah
Next time around fuck I want it to be different yeah
Waitin' on a sign guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord please save her for me do this one favor for me
I had to change my playin' way got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me everywhere I go I'mma have my own
She said "You're the one that I want" yeah


Yeah
And if you gotta leave for work I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love hard when ain't no need to
I go hard on a bitch like I need to
She said "Boy you want your cake and eat it too"
I said "It's cake that's what you're supposed to do"
She said "What if I hurt you"
I said "What if I hurt you first"
Only way to trust you is to flush you and that's crazy huh
We need to take it back to '06 when Dwayne was the president
And shorty owe me for that time I let her borrow my Lexus
Promised to pay me back I'm just waitin' on that blessing
Lord please let her pass my test without no complications


I hope the timing's right I know you see me see me
I wouldn't want to be me be me
And if I wasn't me I wouldn't even wanna be me ooh yeah
But you know the real me oh yeah
Said "You know the real me" yeah


What's up with all these questions What you want from me
It's like you got some shit you want to get off your chest with me
I mean damn why the hell you got to press the issue
I'm a walk away yeah go 'head and wish you
You know I'm too forgiving plus I got expensive vision
I got this shit together you just paying all attention huh
You know you can't keep a player down let another player in
So I'ma skate off with hot shit cold vixen
The every now and then text message "I miss it"
Uh oh I hope she hit the gym I hope she doin' squats
That ass gettin' fatter and I ain't mad I'm just being honest


I hope the timing's right I know you see me see me
I wouldn't want to be me be me
And if I wasn't me I wouldn't even wanna be me ooh yeah
But you know the real me oh yeah
Said "You know the real me" yeah


Oh oh oh
Oh yeah oh oh
Oh oh oh yeah
See the real me yeah

Verse 1: Kai
What I would do to take away this fear of being loved
Allegiance to the pain
Now I'm f****d up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you

Chorus: Kai
I'm only human can't you see
I made I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it ooh
Never be like you
I would give anything to change this fickle-minded heart
That loves fake shiny things
Now I'm f****d up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you
Never be like you

Verse 2: Kai
I'm breathing in the smoke a night owl tangled in the cords
This isn't happiness
And I'm so happy that it's over

Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay

I made I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it ooh
Never be like you
I would give anything to change this fickle-minded heart
That loves fake shiny things
Now I'm f****d up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you
Never be like you
Alright here are the uncensored lyrics of "In the Night" by The Weeknd:

All alone she was living
In a world without an end or beginning
Babygirl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind I don't mind oh

And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind I don't mind

And I know that she's capable of anything
It's riveting but you and I know what it means
And we're gonna let it burn burn burn burn

 We're gonna let it burn burn burn burn
Gonna let it burn burn burn burn

She was dancing yeah she's dancing
And I don't know what it means but it's
A little bit dangerous oh
All alone we're all alone
In her mind she's all alone
All alone we're all alone

And you know we're gonna let it burn burn burn burn
We're gonna let it burn burn burn burn
Gonna let it burn burn burn burn

She's got me hypnotized mesmerized
With the way she moves
Ooh how I love the way she moves
I don't know why I don't know why
But I love it yeah I love it
Uh oh oh

She's got me hypnotized mesmerized
Ooh how I love the way she moves
I don't know why I don't know why
But I love it yeah I love it

All alone she was living
In a world without an end or beginning
Babygirl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind I don't mind

And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind I don't mind

And I know that she's capable of anything
It's riveting but you and I know what it means
And we're gonna let it burn burn burn burn
We're gonna let it burn burn burn burn
Who's that sexy thang I see over there
That's me standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thang hangin' 'round my neck
That's gold show me some respect

I thank God every day uh huh
That I woke up feelin' this way uh huh
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else nuh uh

If I was you I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to VIP
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie Tom Cruise
So bless me baby achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do

I thank God every day uh huh
That I woke up feelin' this way uh huh
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else nuh uh

If I was you I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

I'm sorry I'm not sorry
Feelin' bad for myself
Can't stop myself
I'm crazy and I don't need nobody else or you uh huh
If I was you I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
Well I'll try to fulfill your request Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Ex's & Oh's" by Elle King:

Well I had me a boy turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa and then I let him go
Now there's one in California who's been cursin' my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK hey hey
Until I made my getaway

One two three they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One two three they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh oh oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter left him frozen in the spring
My my how the seasons go by
I get high and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking and the heads just roll
You know that's how the story goes

One two three they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One two three they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh oh oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

One two three they gonna run back to me
Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas
One two three they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come but they never wanna leave

My ex's and the oh oh oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and the oh oh oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go 
Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars
In the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough

That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
A happy man baby hmm

Baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint you're a goddess the cutest the hottest
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man yeah

I don't need no vacation no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Well if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh oh hmm yeah

Cause I I wanna see you
Dance slow move fast

Oops I done fell for your way baby

And I know from the first time the first time

Back at me and I knew that




You had a once in a lifetime

And baby I'll be steering it

And we could get high fall apart
Get lost then start again
I know that you're feeling it
Finally baby there's no pretending

Is it because of our love truth or truth of the matter is
We're not good together but damn good at being bad

There's no need to promise me

In our own way we'll both get by oh

There's no need to promise me

And she'll always get the best of me the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know yeah this I know

She told me "Don't worry about it"
She told me "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love oh oh woo

But I love it but I love it oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it but I love it oh

All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know yes I know

Oh angels sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down when I was hurt
You came to lift me up

Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

And said drink from me drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough

Put your wings on me wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm lower lower lower low

I'm a woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She said "I ain't f***in' you to the mornin'"

Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know it
Stayin' over late I'ma 'f*** you in the mornin'
She know a real one when she see a real one
All these other n***as tryna be a feel one
All these goofy tings that you deal with
Tell 'em to make a move and stop stallin' and stalling
She know the game inside out
Told me "You put me on planes I get saucy when I arrive now"
Bad ting from Brampton I swear she's Riri-side now
Everything explicit 'til we decide out



So say it say it
Just say you love me need me want me
You need to save it save it
All the talkin' baby save that for me
So say it say it
Just say you love me need me want me
You need to save it save it

Woke up with your girlfriend in my bed today
I just made a couple racks and blew every single stack today
I just spent a hunnid racks and got it right back today
Yeah I'm on now it's hard to break me
Been down for a minute but I always bounce back bounce back
Got a lot of tings in the stash stash
Only bring 'em out when it's time to showcase showcase



So say it say it
Just say you love me need me want me
You need to save it save it
All the talkin' baby save that for me
So say it say it
Just say you love me need me want me
You need to save it save it
All the talkin' baby save that for me

There was a time when I was alone  
Nowhere to go and no place to call home  
My only friend was the man in the moon  
And even sometimes he would go away too  

Then one night as I closed my eyes  
I saw a shadow flying high  
He came to me with the sweetest smile  
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile  
He said "Peter Pan that's what they call me  
I promise that you'll never be lonely " and ever since that day  

I am a lost boy from Neverland  
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan  
And when we're bored we play in the woods  
Always on the run from Captain Hook  
"Run run lost boy " they say to me  
Away from all of reality  
Neverland is home to lost boys like me  
And lost boys like me are free  

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe  
Believe in him and believe in me  
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green  
To your beautiful destiny  
As we soared above the town that never loved me  
I realized I finally had a family  
Soon enough we reached Neverland  
Peacefully my feet hit the sand  

And ever since that day  

I am a lost boy from Neverland  
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan  
And when we're bored we play in the woods  
Always on the run from Captain Hook  
"Run run lost boy " they say to me  
Away from all of reality  
Neverland is home to lost boys like me  
And lost boys like me are free  

Peter Pan Tinker Bell Wendy Darling  
Even Captain Hook you are my perfect storybook  
Neverland I love you so  
You are now my home sweet home  
Forever a lost boy at last  

And for always I will say  

I am a lost boy from Neverland  
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan  
And when we're bored we play in the woods  
Always on the run from Captain Hook  
"Run run lost boy " they say to me  
Away from all of reality  
Neverland is home to lost boys like me  
And lost boys like me are free

Could've easily been revised
Living inside a bustling cage
A life is perfect so why did I feel quite inadequate
You know it's just me myself and I
Solo right up until I die
'Cause I got me for life

I'm young and I'm foolish I've made bad decisions
I block out the news turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree I'm somewhat naive
I've made it this far on my own

But lately that shit ain't been getting me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

Maybe I'll pray pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you no but
I'm gonna pray

You won't find me in church no no no
Reading the Bible no no no
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees I'm beggin' you please
I'm broken alone and afraid
He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams

Wildest dreams
Ah-aah-aah

I said no one has to know what we do
And his voice is a familiar sound nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams

Ah-aah-aaah-eah-aah-aaah
Wildest dreams
Ah-aah-aaah-eah-aah-aaah
Wildest dreams

I can see you again
Even if it's just in my

Wildest dreams
Ah-aah-aaah-eah-aah-aaah
Wildest dreams
Ah-aah-aaah-eah-aah-aaah

Say you'll remember me
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend
Staring at two different views on your window ledge  
Coffee has gone cold it's like time froze  
There you go wishing floating down our wishing well  
It's like I'm always causing problems causing hell  
I didn't mean to put you through this I can tell  
We're gonna sweep this under the carpet  
I hope that I can turn back the time  
To make it all alright all alright for us  
I'll promise to build a new world for us two  
With you in the middle  
With you in the middle  
With you in the middle
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "On My Mind" by Ellie Goulding:

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home you're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Hide Away" by Daya:

Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away

Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate all the money
And the time that it takes to be fly as a mother

Got my both eyes out for Mr Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find him
But I hope he reads this then he'll know
I'm the type that girl you'd be down to grow old

Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away

He got that heart of gold and that fame
Tryna keep bright light in a shaded place
I'm ready for him oh baby why can't he see
Got me feelin' like I'm stranded and I'm lost at sea

Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away

Take me to another place where I'll be entertained
He just want my waist want my waist without a brain
Every single night he's off with a different name
If I'ma be a choice they ain't gonna do me this way

Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away

Oh gotta hide away away away

Do you recall not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent remember
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old
Will we walk down the same road
Will you be there by my side
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on
We need someone to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on lean on lean on lean on

What will we do when we get old
Will we walk down the same road
Will you be there by my side
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on
We need someone to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on lean on lean on lean on
Hey hey

Nothing that we don't wanna tell you about no


Cause it's too cold whoa

So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater


And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say

To move to a place so far away

The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste yeah


These hearts adore

For you here and now

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater


And if I may just take your breath away

To move to a place so far away

The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist

Put my finger on your tongue

You know just what to say
Things that scare me
I should just walk away
But I can't move my feet

The more that I know you the more I want to
Something inside meâ€™s changed
I was so much younger yesterday


I am not a stranger to the dark
"Hideaway" they say
'Cause we donâ€™t want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
"Runaway" they say
No one'll love you as you are


But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious


When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood gonna drown them out
I am brave I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be this is me


Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies this is me


Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh oh


Another round of bullets hits my skin
We'll fire away 'cause today I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades and
Reaching for the sun we are warriors
Yeah that's what we've become yeah that's what we've become


I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious


When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood gonna drown them out
I am brave I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be this is me


Look out 'cause here I come look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum marching on marching marching on
I'm not scared to be seen I make no apologies oh this is me


Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh oh


And I know that I deserve your love oh-oh-oh-oh
There's nothing I'm not worthy of oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh oh oh oh
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood gonna drown them out
This is brave this is proof
This is who I'm meant to be this is me

Turn your magic on Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
We are legends every day
That's what she told me


Turn your magic on to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds


I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
Oh you make me feel
Like I'm alive again


Turn your magic on to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape


We are diamonds taking shape
If we've only got this life
This adventure oh then I
Wanna share it with you


With you with you
I said oh say oh
With you with you
I said oh say oh


'Cause you make me feel alive
I've been locked up inside Diaspora without you
Oh oh
I feel my heart beating
Yeah you make me feel
Like I'm alive again


Turn your magic on Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape


Oh the adventure will begin
Oh the adventure will begin
You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the key's under the mat
Childhood stars shine always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Don't steal don't cheat and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind

Know the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pick-up line so
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Don't steal don't cheat and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

When it's hot eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind

And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again


Damn who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things weâ€™ve been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldnâ€™t last
Had to switch up
Look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place uh


How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride


First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong and whatâ€™s
Small turn to a friendship a friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what we reach
So remember me when Iâ€™m gone
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride


How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride


So let the light guide your way yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home home

Put in them hours I'mma make it hotter

Seems like they're just happier than us these days yeah

These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently


Yeah and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as the expectations
Last night I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

Ain't no need to complicate it it's too simple yeah
But I know you're not a liar I know you're not a liar nah

Last night I got high as the expectations
Last night I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

Ain't no need to complicate it it's too simple yeah
But I know you're not a liar I know you're not a liar nah

Steady in my soul oh no

And all that we know

So if you want to live life on your own terms
You gotta be willing to crash and burn
At least you know you're alive

But when I put my buzz on baby there's no way

Wicked or weakness you gotta see this

D'USSÃ‰ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good won't you sit it on my taste bloods

Pull up on your block then break it down: we playin' Tetris

Piss out your per diem You just gotta hate 'em funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it you and I know bitch be humble

Hittin' off licks in the bando
Black X6 Phantom

Goin' out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers hundred hammers
Black X6 Phantom

Pockets swole Danny

The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one be the one tonight


When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious oh yeah
Girl I hope you're sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises


But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby I'm perfect
Baby I'm perfect for you


And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby you're perfect
Baby you're perfect
So let's start right now


And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out
Oh yeah
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Baby I'm perfect
Baby we're perfect


If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby I'm perfect
Baby I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby you're perfect
Baby you're perfect
So let's start right now

Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said I know
I've heard it all before at least a million times
I'm not one to forget you know


I don't believe I don't believe it
You left in peace left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe I'm on my knees
Right now 'ow


I'm so sick of that same old love that shit it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love my body's had enough
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Of that same old love oh oh oh oh oh oh


I'm so sick of that same old love feels like I've blown apart
I'm so sick of that same old love the kind that breaks your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
That same old love


I don't believe I don't believe it
You left in peace left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe I'm on my knees
Right now 'ow


I'm so sick of that same old love that shit it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love my body's had enough
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Of that same old love oh oh oh oh oh oh


Am I making myself clear
My love my love my love
'Cause if you're trying to break me down
You know that it won't work
Don't don't try to tell me what to do
Don't don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way


I'm so sick of that same old love that shit it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love my body's had enough
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Of that same old love

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you

I'm just a sucker for pain

I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

I'm a sucker for pain

I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war yeah without failure
Do it for the fam dog ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society all this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like who gon' try us
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain

More pain
Got me beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin'
For more pain

For more pain
Got me beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin'

I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now gettin' it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it
No pain no gain never stand down made our own way
Never going slow we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain

More pain
Got me beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin'

I'm a sucker for pain
I'm a sucker for pain
It ain't nothing but pain
You just fuckin' complain
You ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane
Just don't fuck up a good thing
You wanna walk in my shoes
You wanna wear my crown
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain

More pain
Got me beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin' beggin'
For more pain

Verse 1:
Hey I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

Chorus:
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No I can't stop

Verse 2:
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

Chorus:
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No I can't stop

Bridge:
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson okay

Chorus:
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No I can't stop

Chorus:
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find 
I know it's hard sometimes 
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind 
I know it's hard sometimes 
Yeah I think about the end just way too much 
But it's fun to fantasize 
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was 
But it's fun to fantasize 


Oh oh I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride 
Oh oh I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride 


"I'd die for you" that's easy to say 
We have a list of people that we would take 
A bullet for them a bullet for you 
A bullet for everybody in this room 
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through 
See many bullets coming through 
Metaphorically I'm the man 
But literally I don't know what I'd do 


"I'd live for you" and that's hard to do 
Even harder to say when you know it's not true 
Even harder to write when you know that tonight 
There were people back home who try talking to you 
But then you ignore them still 
All these questions they're for real like 
Who would you live for 
Who would you die for 
And would you ever kill 


I've been thinking too much 
Help me 
I've been thinking too much 
Help me 


I've been thinking too much 
I've been thinking too much 


I've been thinking too much 
Help me 
I've been thinking too much 
Help me
