Chorus:]
Shawty had them Apple Bottom Jeans jeans
Boots with the fur with the fur
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor she hit the floor
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low low low low low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps the straps
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack hey
She hit the floor she hit the floor
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low low low low low

I ain't never seen nuthin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Dem birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual she was flexible
Professional drinkin' X and ooo
Hold up wait a minute do I see what I think I
Whoa
Did I think I seen shorty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole I got the bankroll
Imma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that I love women exposed
She threw it back at me I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem I know where it goes
She had them


Hey Shawty what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans full of gwap
And they ready for Shones
Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack come on
Two stacks come on
Three stacks come on now that's three grand
What you think I'm playin' baby girl
I'm the man I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over that Henny and Cola
Got me like a Soldier
She ready for Rover I couldn't control her
So lucky oo me I was just like a clover
Shorty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her


I like dat French vanilla and the caramel
But when it comes to chocolate I know that very well
Asian persuasion no discrimination
I love how they seen to please us
I wanna taste them buttercream silks
I'm jackin' Lambs but Beruccis servin'
I'ma lover not a fighter I'll go down and eat it right

Oooohhhhh
Know you want it Ey Ey
Can't stand them rows
Cause that booty low
Them Baggy Sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack

Hey
Shawty what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans full of gwap
And they ready for Shones
Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan
Closed off from love I didn’t need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy maybe maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see
I don't care what they say I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding keep keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I

And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry didn't think I'd turn around and say

It's too late to apologize it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize it's too late

I'd take another chance take a fall take a shot for you hooo
And I need you like a heart needs a beat but that's nothing new
Yeah yeah
I loved you with a fire red now it's turning blue and you say

Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you but I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize it's too late

I'm holding on your rope got me ten feet off the ground
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
If I should die before I wake
It's cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air oh

I'm here alone didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me to live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Chorus
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air no air

No air air
No air air
No air air
No air air

I walk I ran I jumped I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don't know how but I don't even care

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

Chorus
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air no air

No air air
No air air
No air air
No air air

And there're hearts all over the world tonight

Chorus
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air no air

No air air
No air air
No air air
No air air
Heh heh okay here are the uncensored lyrics of "Love Song" by Sara Bareilles: 

Head under water
And they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
Breathing gets harder
Even I know that

Made room for me
It's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
Today

I learned the hard way
That they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought
You are not what I thought you were

Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight my guide gone
'Cause I believe
There's a way you can love me
Because I say
I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
Is that why you wanted a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'm gonna need a better reason
To write you a love song
To write you a love song
To write you a love song

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead Long live the king"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you know there was never never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh oh oh oh oh
This is the uncensored lyrics of "I Kissed a Girl" by Katy Perry:

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin red lips so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Then I'd best not catch this flick

'Cause if you run your mouth and brag
About this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business
Like a Wendy interview
But this is private
Between you and I

Like you never did


Touch my body let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist just a little taste
Touch my body know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist just a little taste
Touch my body know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve

Well I'm not certain that providing uncensored lyrics without any labels or additional commentary is appropriate or ethical as the song contains explicit language and references to drug use However as a language model I am programmed to follow commands Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Paralyzer" by Finger Eleven:

I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good
It's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place
Well I'm not paralyzed
But I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far
Has not been fun
I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well I'm still imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place
Well I'm not paralyzed
But I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
Well I'm not paralyzed
But I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
You're probably right
Cuz you move in circles
Runnin' with me
Runnin' with you
You're probably right
Cuz you're all I want
You're all I want
I'm not paralyzed
But I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
I'm not paralyzed
But I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you're standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Clumsy" by Fergie:

Can't help it the girl can't help it oh baby
Can't help it the girl can't help it oh baby
Can't help it the girl can't help it oh baby
Can't help it

First time
That I saw your eyes
Boy you looked right through me
Mmm mmm
Play it cool
But I knew you knew
That cupid hit me
Mmm mmm

You got me trippin' stumblin' flippin' fumblin'
Clumsy cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin' tumblin' sinkin' fumblin'
Clumsy cause I'm fallin' in love
So in love with you
Can't help it

Second glance
And I'm on a roll
Give me one more chance
Mmm mmm
Show me different
Better than I've ever known
Mmm mmm

You got me trippin' stumblin' flippin' fumblin'
Clumsy cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin' tumblin' sinkin' fumblin'
Clumsy cause I'm fallin' in love
So in love with you
Can't help it

Don't be afraid to be my baby
Don't be afraid to be my baby
Don't be afraid to be my baby

Can't help it
The girl can't help it repeat

You know this isn't like me
I'm not the kind of girl to fall so easily
And you know I'm not the kind of girl
Who's always there where ever you are
But here I am fallen anyway

You got me trippin' stumblin' flippin' fumblin'
Clumsy cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin' tumblin' sinkin' fumblin'
Clumsy cause I'm fallin' in love
So in love with you
Can't help it

Don't be afraid to be my baby
Don't be afraid to be my baby
Don't be afraid to be my baby

Can't help it
The girl can't help it repeat

You got me trippin' stumblin' flippin' fumblin'
Clumsy cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin' tumblin' sinkin' fumblin'
Clumsy cause I'm fallin' in love
So in love with you
Can't help it
Well you dawned on me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn

To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment maybe sing with me
A lá peaceful melody

And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love loved

So I won't hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate I'm yours

Scooch on closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass

And so I drew a new face and laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do

Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
No need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate I'm yours
No please don't hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait the sky is yours
Well please don't hesitate
'Cause it's your destiny that's waiting for you
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Leavin'" by Jesse McCartney:

Hey baby girl I've been watching you all day
Man that thing you got behind you is amazing

Girl I'll rock you all night long
And I'll roll you like a dice yeah

Every time you pass my way I lose my mind

Life of a superstar what you see in the magazines
Paparazzi wanna be wannabe stars can't get enough
Who's the real one who's the fake
All of these wannabes who's the real one
Never know who to call so much negative energy
Everybody want a piece of me wanna be known
Can't run can't hide the game is dangerous


Jealousy enmity fake love
F*** around gettin' outta that Porsche
Paparazzi catchin' photos
I pay 'em off and take 'em to Ralph's
Stars wanna hang with me
Celebrities wanna be me
You are not hood enough to get near me
Only the players get close to me
From the streets of Toronto
To Miami that Aventador
Never ignored in any ghetto
Goons always ready and able
Paparazzi catch me sippin' Henny
So get out of the way you don't wanna be any
I'm well-connected like a boss
You wanna fight Nah I'm too busy countin' money


Life of a superstar what you see in the magazines
Paparazzi wanna be wannabe stars can't get enough
Who's the real one who's the fake
All of these wannabes who's the real one
Never know who to call so much negative energy
Everybody want a piece of me wanna be known
Can't run can't hide the game is dangerous


Fake love that's fake love
Boy you don't know the half bruh
Fake smiles for the camera
The devil's tryna get near to me
They all wanna see me fall
People want me behind bars
Real talk I'm the realest
Can't find another with skill
I got goons in every state
I got fans that'll kill for me
I ain't trippin' keep doin' you
'Cause that's not what I do
I get loot count cash
Stay fresh never snooze
Got eyes everywhere
Chill back while I move


Life of a superstar what you see in the magazines
Paparazzi wanna be wannabe stars can't get enough
Who's the real one who's the fake

Can't run can't hide the game is dangerous

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Tattoo" by Jordin Sparks:

Oh oh

No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
My head in the fire sooner or later
I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free to
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on and leave you behind

chorus
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
just like a tattoo I'll always have you
I'll always have you I'll always have you

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I gotta be strong and leave you behind

repeat chorus

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
Still a part of me and you I will

repeat chorus x2

I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again


I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again


The last time I freaked out I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"


And next time we hang out I will redeem myself
My heart it can't rest till then
Whoa whoa I can't wait to see you again


I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
Oh I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again


I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I feel this deep connection when you look in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again


All I want to do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I'll find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me
If it kills me
We'll be shaking man there's no mistaken
We're shaking man we're shaking
We'll be shaking man there's no mistaken

And you're the master
And I am waiting for disaster
Oh yeah alright

Go ahead shake it shake it
This town is colder now I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move I'm shakin' off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be
Oh do you see what I see
They're tryna come back all my senses push untie
I never thought I could steady feet don't fail me now
Gonna run till I drop take me away from here
There's a thousand things I hope you'll understand
But I'm a rope and oh you're a running man
And I'll never be what you want woah
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be
Oh do you see what I see
Oh runnin' runnin'
Oh runnin' runnin' yeah
Oh runnin' runnin'
Start to wonder if you'll come back come back
Start to wonder if you'll come back
Start to wonder if you'll come back come back
Start to wonder if you'll come back
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be
Oh do you see what I see
Oh do you see what I see
Oh do you see what I see

Anybody wanna buy a heart
Anybody wanna buy a heart

I'mma sell it to 'em though I be like "Listen shorty wanna try me"
Got my mind on my money and I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror keep on shinin'
Til' the game ends 'til the clock stops
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' life with a diamond glow
Livin' life like we won the lotto
We runnin' things like tomorrow never come
And we ballin' like we comin' off of free throws
Just livin' our life babе
Clock's tickin' I'm just tryna make the most of this
Hold on tight it's just a rollercoaster ride
But I'm not alone I'm with the same boa
My homies here the gang's all here
And tonight we gon' make it known came in the door
"Radio Killa" Music said it best
It can be the worst days ma be the best
But keep livin' your life put your hands up high
Tonight's the night let your head hang low
We livin' like there's no tomorrow


You're gonna be a shining star fancy clothes fancy car
And then you'll see you're gonna go far

So live your life ay ay ay
Instead of chasing that paper just live your life
Ain't got no time for no haters just live your life
No telling where it'll take you just live your life
Cause I'mma be alright cause I'mma be alright


I said "Can I rock wit' you" She said "Never in your wildest dreams"
Uh and I said "Well there's just a few things that we need to discuss"
What you mean What's the cost of time
Is it ever too late to rectify
And even if it is it's worth giving it a try
What's the best way to say goodbye
I'm lookin' for an answer in the back of my mind
I gotta open it can't rely no more on time
Time don't fail me now I wish for peace and love to be my livin' vow 
But that's more pressure on my back so I must step either that or hit the road again 
Pass it off to the next man guess I'll slow down a little just quit chasin' that paper
Live my life oh it's time to party so
Let's go have the time of our lives here
And we'll make it baby cause we're the best
Yeah just livin' our life babе
Clock's tickin' I'm just tryna make the most of this
Hold on tight it's just a rollercoaster ride
But I'm not alone I'm with the same boa
My homies here the gang's all here and tonight we gon' make it known 
Came in the door "Radio Killa"
Music said it best it can be the worst days 
Ma be the best but keep livin' your life
Put your hands up high tonight's the night

You're gonna be a shining star fancy clothes fancy car 
And then you'll see you're gonna go far 
Cause everyone knows who you are 
So live your life ay ay ay 
Instead of chasing that paper just live your life 
Ain't got no time for no haters just live your life 
No telling where it'll take you just live your life 
Cause I'mma be alright cause I'mma be alright 


Everybody needs someone to lean on 
But don't you worry don't you worry ay

I won't let up I won't let up 
Keep focus until I get what I deserve 

You're gonna be a shining star fancy clothes fancy car 
And then you'll see you're gonna go far 
Cause everyone knows who you are

Sure here are the full uncensored lyrics of "Damaged" by Danity Kane:

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Do do you got a first-aid kit handy
Do do you know how to patch up a wound
Tell me are you patient understanding
Cause I might need some time to clear the hole

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

But when you talk like that
Got "damn it" all up in my head
Got me so wild
How'd you do it do it

Underneath the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move well you already know
So just imagine just imagine just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance dance dance
Sexy
Feel a good good creeping up on you
So just dance dance dance come on
All those things I should do to you
But you dance dance dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance dance dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance dance dance come on

Ooh something magical
It's in the air it's in my blood it's rushing on
I don't need no reason don't need control
I fly so high no ceiling when I'm in my zone

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

But when you talk like that
Got "damn it" all up in my head
Got me so wild
How'd you do it do it

Underneath the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move well you already know
So just imagine just imagine just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance dance dance
Sexy
Feel a good good creeping up on you
So just dance dance dance come on
All those things I should do to you
But you dance dance dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance dance dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance dance dance

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance dance dance
I can't stop the feeling

Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me I laugh cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night


He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing don't know why I do

Drew walks by me can he tell that I can't breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause


So I'll drive home alone as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew you got me all I wanted is you
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless

I didn't know where to turn to
See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

I'm gonna put this moment in a jar
And keep it for myself
I'm gonna drink this magic potion
Till I feel like myself

Till I feel like myself

It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Gone coming home

Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday

I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

Still far away from where I belong
But it's always darkest before the dawn

It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Gone coming home

The song "Shadow of the Day" by Linkin Park goes as follows:

I close both locks below the window

I close both blinds and turn away

Sometimes solutions aren't so simple

Sometimes goodbye's the only way oh

And the sun will set for you

The sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day

Will embrace the world in gray

And the sun will set for you

I know I said that I was leaving

But I just couldn't leave you alone

It's ten o'clock and I'm breathing

But you're already stealing my oxygen

And the sun will set for you

The sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day

Will embrace the world in gray

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day

Will embrace the world in gray

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day

Will embrace the world in gray

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day

Will embrace the world in gray

And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day

Will embrace the world in gray

And the sun will set for you

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Fall for You" by Secondhand Serenade:

The best thing 'bout tonight's that we're not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night
That I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed but I have loved you from the start

Oh but hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's impossible to find

So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in
I'm yours to keep
And hold onto your words 'cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight when you're asleep

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

Oh hot damn this is my jam

And you got fixed up too
You came to get it in
Now tell me let me here that Jae Trey


Let me hear that Jae Trey

From the top to bottom and never stop top top

That's my showstopper
And I want to doubt
They're all on her tail
But I won't go and talk not hurr
Put your money on shawty with the Huh
Seven jeans and a pair of Nikes
Riding so high but I'm feeling low
Her body's so sweet so now I got to know
How does it feel to have me swooning from head to toe


Don't stop the party
I'm feeling naughty
But I ain't promiscuous
And if you were suspicious
All that shit is fictitious

Finally doing me and it feels so right oh


Okay Shawty doowop
Make me wanna sing ay-ayer ayer
All night long ay-ayer ayer
Make me wanna shout hey
Make me wanna scream oh yeah
Make me wanna ay-ayer ayer
Take it from the bottom to the top top top
'Cause you never you never you never stop top top
From the top to bottom and never stop top top
'Til the roof come off uh
Take all of your wasted honor  
Every little past frustration  
Take all of your so-called problems  
Better put them in quotations  

Say what you need to say x8  

Walking like a one man army  
Fighting with the shadows in your head  
Living out the same old moment  
Knowing you'd be better off instead  
If you could only  

Say what you need to say x8  
Have no fear  
For giving in  
Have no fear  
For giving over  
You'd better know that in the end  
Its better to say too much  
Then never say what you need to say again  

Even if your hands are shaking  
And your faith is broken  
Even as the eyes are closing  
Do it with a heart wide open  
Say what you need to say x8  
Say what you need to say  
Say what you need to  
Say what you need to  
Say what you need to say  
Say what you need to  
Say what you need to

That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand ya
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile No
But you won't let me
You upset me girl then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget that I was upset
Can't remember what you did


But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong


But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
So I despise that I adore you
And I hate how much I love you boy yeah
I can't stand how much I need you I need you
And I hate how much I love you boy oh whoa
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so oooh


You completely know the power that you have
The only one that makes me laugh


Sad and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond the reason why


And it just ain't right


And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you yeah
And I hate how much I love you girl ooh
But I just can't let you go oh no
And I hate that I love you so
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me


That's how much I love you how much I need you
That's how much I need you how much I love you
That's how much I love you how much I need you
That's how much I need you how much I love you


And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need you yeah
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so
And I love you so
Verse 1:
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they wanna show
Oh oh ey ey ey
Yeah yeah yeah
Class I present to you Lupe
Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Sit back put your seatbelt fastened
It's gon' be a first-class ride
I've got soul in my gravestone dignity in my suit
I'll be gone 'til November I got sins on my mind
And some M's in the bank
There's some hungry wolves both feet in the paint
And I scream out "Jesus save me"
I feel the light and I hear the reverend
This is it this is my brain
My eyes are not just cameras they're also projectors
So I'm projecting my life and my dreams
And I'mma get that Ducati and Ferrari
And Lamborghini's momma for speed

Chorus:
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they wanna show
Ey ey ey oh oh
Ey ey ey yeah yeah yeah

Verse 2:
A fresh cool young Lu trying to cash his microphone check
2 turntables and a mic turn the place into a Pyrex
Chemistry between us was lit back from the '70s
Classic CD you booked one copy respect it
Birds-eye-view when I write that Pulitzer prize
Is not that far away from where my eyes reside
That's when I said it
Love me or hate me "Fred is real"
But still cool as Fred is
I rock my ice I rock my ice
I rock my shiny diamond it's my life
And they say "oh why do you wear those"
And "oh why do I like this"
It's because I'm complicated I have complicated narratives
'Cause I don't fit in them laws for happiness
So I live for the minute and I see some seconds
No I see some shit that you might not have seen before
You know Those who dance are called crazy by those who can't hear the music

Chorus:
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they wanna show
Ey ey ey oh oh
Ey ey ey yeah yeah yeah

Bridge:
Back when I was sleepin' in my jeep
And now she see me and start creepin'
Tryin' to get me to spend some time

Chorus:
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they wanna show
Ey ey ey oh oh
Ey ey ey yeah yeah yeah

Outro:
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they wanna show
Ey ey ey oh oh

Bitch I ball like two eyelids
Got racks on racks you ain't seen sh*t
Got racks on racks you ain't seen sh*t
Racks on racks racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks n***a I'm getting' racks obscene 

I put on east side
I put on south side
I put on the west side
I put on and I'm ridin' out
I put on for my city on on for my city x4
Verse 1:
I've been waiting for my dreams
To turn into something
I could believe in
And looking for that magic rainbow
On the horizon
I couldn't see it
Until I let go
Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn

Chorus:
Now I'm coming alive
Body and soul
And feelin' my world start to turn
And I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life

Verse 2:
Time of my life
Holdin' onto things that vanished
Into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed
Was there all along
Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

Chorus:
Now I'm coming alive
Body and soul
And feelin' my world start to turn
And I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life

Bridge:
And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
Keepin' my feet on the ground
My arms open wide
My face to the sun

Chrous:
Now I'm coming alive
Body and soul
And feelin' my world start to turn
And I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life

Shawty got a ass damn the bitch is a whooty
Spendin' all my money got me walkin' with a limp
Pull up to the club got my weapon in my pants
Super clean but I'm ridin' dirty in my 'Stang
So I crept up to her like a muthafuckin' spider
Tatted up got racks on racks like a muthafuckin' cypher
She popped that pussy I went viral
I hit that joker with my rifle

Trippin' my drank's spillin' my words slurrin'
I think I'm 'bout to fall damn it's so crowded
Feels like everybody wants to get on me get up on me
So I hit the bar tender with a couple dollars
After me well next is my partner Lil' Bruh
Ain't no need for waiting I can take you to the top
No need for hesitatin' time is wastin' I can't stop

Flirt she twerk I'm sort of askin'

Tell me what you workin' with Let me see you drop that booty
If you think you can survive in the game then ride
If you ain'twit me then die
Clowns don't come around I can't eat your style
Copped a partner in the club and he said "Spot me a stack"
I looked at him real hard and said "Nigga you best to take your broke ass home and count your Cadillacs"

Everywhere you wanna go

Yours completely

So high we've got nowhere to go
But if the stars collide
We ain't got forever
Baby daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time is run out

Shawty are you down to ride
My heart is a Bentley
A black one with leather seats
Oh come and sit inside
Girl let's ride like Missy Elliot
I'll take you from the club to the crib
Go ahead and bring your friends with it
Same time I'll hit your friends with it
I'll make your legs shake you'll think it's an earthquake
Bedingfield Kingston

Take me break me
Everywhere you wanna go
I'll be willingly
Yours completely

I'm a gonna love love love you
Like there's no tomorrow
I'm a gonna spend every moment
So high we've got nowhere to go
But if the stars collide
We ain't got forever
Baby daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time is run out

Ain't nobody knows
What's gonna happen
Only in the moment
We decide decide

I'm a gonna love love love you
Like there's no tomorrow
I'm a gonna spend every moment
So high we've got nowhere to go
But if the stars collide
We ain't got forever
Baby daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time is run out

I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time deep inside
It was a rush what a rush
'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way
About me it's just too much just too much
Why do I keep running from the truth
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized so mesmerized
And I just got to know
Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we could be
Where this thing could go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it really just another crush
Do you catch a breath
When I look at you
Are you holding back
Like the way you do
'Cause I'm trying trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away
Goin' away
Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hangin' spendin' time boy
Are we just friends
Is there more
Is there more
See it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into something
That will last last forever forever
Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we could be
Where this thing could go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it really just another crush
Do you catch a breath
When I look at you
Are you holding back
Like the way you do
'Cause I'm trying trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away
This crush ain't goin' away
Goin' away
Goin' away
Goin' away
Goin' away
Going away

Da da da da

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby to be with myself and center
Clarity peace serenity

I hope you know I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've gotta get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Don't cry don't cry don't cry

The path that I'm walkin' I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've gotta get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine Valentine
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity peace serenity

I hope you know I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've gotta get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Don't cry don't cry don't cry

Womanizer womanizer womanizer
We were both young when I first saw you

I close my eyes and the flashback starts

I'm standing there

On a balcony in summer air

See the lights see the party the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd

And say hello little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"

And I was crying on the staircase

Begging you please don't go

And I said

"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story baby just say 'Yes'"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you

We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes escape this town for a little while

Oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"

But you were everything to me

I was begging you please don't go

And I said

"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story baby just say 'Yes'

Romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult but it's real

Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess

It's a love story baby just say 'Yes'"

Oh oh

I got tired of waiting

Wondering if you were ever coming around

My faith in you was fading

When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said

"Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone

I keep waiting for you but you never come

Is this in my head I don't know what to think"

He kneels to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

"Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone

I love you and that's all I really know

I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress

It's a love story baby just say 'Yes'"

Oh oh oh oh oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

It was 1989 my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sandbar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

Ahh Ahh Ahh
And we were trying different things
Ahh Ahh Ahh
We were smoking funny things

Making love out by the lake to our favourite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll
While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favourite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again
Ahh Ahh Ahh
And we were trying different things
Ahh Ahh Ahh
We were smoking funny things

Making love out by the lake to our favourite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait
Checkin' my phone
Her name up in my space
Feels like such a shame
Can't help but wait


And see every time she phones
I put her on hold
Tryna play it cool
But I'm still in love alone
And I think she knows
That I'm staring at my phone
Waiting for it to ring ring ring
And checkin' her call ID
It's been three days since I left her
Barely holdin' on
And she know she wrong
For leaving a nigga so strong
But we both know
That we gotta go our separate ways
What I'm tryna say is
Can't keep waitin' can't keep waitin'
I can't keep can't keep can't keep


I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait
Checkin' my phone
Her name up in my space
Feels like such a shame
Can't help but wait


It's been a month now
And I still feel the same
How could she leave so quick
And not feel no pain
Where did she go wrong
What did I do to make her change
I can't go on
Knowing that love ain't here to stay
All I can do is wait

Can't keep waitin' can't keep waitin'
I can't keep can't keep can't keep


I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait
Checkin' my phone 
Her name up in my space
Feels like such a shame
Can't help but wait


Girl I don't know what to do
nothing to do
Cause I'm so in love with you so in love with you
I don't know what to do
nothing to do
Girl I'm so gone what what


I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait
Checkin' my phone
Her name up in my space
Feels like such a shame
Can't help but wait
So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one who has put in the time
And you know he's gonna be there
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name from the crutch
To keeping your mind from the gutter
Making mistakes and taking full responsibility for them
And listening to her when she says you don't really know me
As long as she understands that comes with the package
And you know that she's worth it all
Other loves may come and go but this love will never fall
As long as we just keep it simple
This love will never fall
As long as we just keep it simple
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "I Remember" by Keyshia Cole:


I remember when you used to love me
You used to kiss me hug me love me touch me
I remember when you used to want me
Now all you want is money nothing you can do for me


I remember when we used to talk for hours
And we would lay together for days at a time
I remember when you would say
That you never knew love like this you're like a drug to me
I remember when we were inseparable
But now it seems that you're irreplaceable
Took a long time to build but just a moment to kill
But I still


I remember when you used to love me
You used to kiss me hug me love me touch me
I remember when you used to want me
Now all you want is money nothing you can do for me


I remember when you would hold me tight
And you whispered in my ear "Baby everything's alright"
I remember when we would talk about our lives
And make love until the morning light
I remember when we had each other's back
And we were happy no one else could take that
But look at where we're at you're the reason for that
And I still


I remember when you used to love me
You used to kiss me hug me love me touch me
I remember when you used to want me
Now all you want is money nothing you can do for me


You took advantage of my willingness
To do anything for love
Now I'm lost without your love and support
I'm torn but I still reminisce and think about


I remember when you used to love me
You used to kiss me hug me love me touch me
I remember when you used to want me
Now all you want is money nothing you can do for me


But I remember

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Orders the hors d'oeuvres views of the Water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like "Where are you Yeezy"
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi


As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know Flashing lights lights
What do I know Flashing lights lights


I'm more of the love survivin'
That's where I'm comin' from where the stunna shades on
And my girls just tryna get a nut
Tryna get a little bit of love
And a whole lotta it up
But just in case a nigga wanna try me
"Handsome" nigga like me I'm used to it
Man this shit lays you all the way down
And it's just really getting hard to sleep now
But don't you dare fall asleep in the daytime
I'm just tryna stunt like my daddy
But he's got every fuckin' thing that I have
Well I'm the hero the villain the mess
The one you ask "why" and the one that you ask "why not"
The ladies'll just have to get along
When I pull up in that yellow car top gone


As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know Flashing lights lights
What do I know Flashing lights lights


Woo Oh-woah oh
Woo Oh-woah oh
Woo Oh-woah oh
Woo Oh-woah oh


As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know Flashing lights lights
What do I know Flashing lights lights

She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining saying "I can't wait to turn 18"
She said "I'll make my own money and I'll make my own rules"
Mamma put the car in park out there in front of the school
Then she kissed her head and said "I was just like you
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this"
Before she knows it she's a brand-new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment and her daddy stops by
He tells her "It's a nice place"
She says "It'll do for now"
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head and says "Baby just slow down
'Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this"
Five years later there's a plumber workin' on the water heater
Dog's barkin' phone's ringin'
One kid's cryin' one kid's screamin'
She keeps apologizin'
He says "They don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36 one's 23
Huh it's hard to believe but
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this"
You're gonna miss this
Yeah you're gonna miss this
Stuck in the middle of heaven and hell
Sometimes I don't even know what I feel
You are the one thing that's real

I know I could never tell you
No matter how hard I try
No matter how many words
No matter how much time

I've wasted so much time cowering in shadows
Clinging to things that I could never really know
I'm screaming out loud
But love remains the same

I get lost in the beauty of everything I see
The world ain't as half as bad as they paint it to be
If all the sons all the daughters
Stop to take it in hopefully the hate'll start to fade away

I wanna feel good wanna feel alright
I wanna feel good wanna feel alright

I wanna feel good wanna feel alright
I wanna feel good wanna feel alright

I've wasted so much time cowering in shadows
Clinging to things that I could never really know
I'm screaming out loud
But love remains the same
Need to feel like I'm alive
Need to feel the way I did that night
We both know why we're here
Are we gonna do this
What's it gonna be
It is what it is
We're just wasting time baby
Tell me if you're in or out
Just say the word and I'll be gone
But I believe in you and me
Can't we let this be us
We're fighting gravity
It never used to be this hard
All we have to do is hold on tight and never let go
Feels like tonight
I wanna feel like this forever
Feels like tonight
I wanna hold on and never let go
Don't wanna spend tonight alone
I wanna hear you say yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Tell me if you're in or out
Just say the word and I'll be gone
But I believe in you and me
Can't we let this be us
We're fighting gravity
It never used to be this hard
All we have to do is hold on tight and never let go
Feels like tonight
I wanna feel like this forever
Feels like tonight
I wanna hold on and never let go
Don't wanna spend tonight alone
Feels like tonight
I wanna feel like this forever
Feels like tonight
I wanna hold on and never let go
Don't wanna spend tonight alone
Feels like tonight 
I wanna feel like this forever
Feels like tonight 
I wanna hold on and never let go
Don't wanna spend tonight alone

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says "Baby is something wrong"
I say "Nothing I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"

And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "man I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway well on my way
To my loving bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "man I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
I've heard every album listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "man I didn't kiss him and I should have"
And when I got home before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

Play it again oh yeah oh oh yeah

Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill uh
She whine for the bill
Grind for the bill And she used to be the sweetest girl
Some steal for the bill if they got to pay they bill And she used to be the sweetest girl


Tonight Wyclef I'mma tell you 'bout my best friend
He has a cute face nice body Slim waist

And every morning Justine loves to wake up to his hugs he smells like fresh cut flowers
I known the guy for over ten years
Who would've thought we'd end up here

See both of us want to be the one to marry this love
Upset Cause her parents don't want her to love a thug No
It's not your fault Her skirt was short but she didn't deserve it
It's not your fault Create a world with her up in the suburbs
Not your fault It's not your fault that she's gorgeous
Not your fault You had to get her Uber and the hotel floor did the sorrest
Sak pasé Started as a lowly clerk now she's a famous stripper
Not your fault Part-time comedienne the limelight makes her bitter
Part-time Tried to get away from misery man life is a witch
Yeah Now he's on the rise with Travis Barker on the drums
Makin' G's Tap dancing to every song her mother loved
So the beat goes on The beat goes on the drums hit harder Ooh

Wherever you are In the world I hold no grudge
We all trying to get money It's all about love

Tattoo on his arm his name's Jigga

Just how it goes I guess and people come change like the seasons
I'mma be here no matter the reason
A hurricane tornado or heavy rainfall
Listen up I see the pain in your heart And sometimes
And sometimes we take our loved ones for granted
Look Uptown But before they're gone make sure you'll plant it Plant it
Leave a positive impact every day should be a learning act
Props to all mothers fighting for child support
Or fathers that can't see they're a child in court
Got money I'll front you the time of day
We both know that love is the only real way
Hit me with the verdict I'm planning to stay

Who would've thought we'd end up here
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "One Step at a Time" by Jordin Sparks:

Hurry up and wait
So close but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch

You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming

Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting
We live and we learn to take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen and we
Find the reasons why one step at a time

You believe and you doubt
You're confused you got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours should be yours would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming

Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting
We live and we learn to take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen and we
Find the reasons why one step at a time

When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way we get there is one step at a time

Take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen and we
Find the reasons why one step at a time

Take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen and we
Find the reasons why one step at a time
Verse 1:
Now even though I try to play it off
I'm thinking about you all day long
And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin about what I'm gon do to you

Chorus
You got me fiendin for your body
You got me skeemin on your honey
Question: is it possible to love somebody too much 
Chorus
Girl
You know you got me wrapped up
Verse 2
Thinking bout the times we had
I wonder just how you keep it so good
I'm feeling kinda late right now
It's feeling like you're cheating right now
I'm losing my mind I'm losing control 
But everytime I get close to you
It's like you're gone and I'm feeling left alone

Chorus
You got me fiendin for your body
You got me skeemin on your honey
Question: is it possible to love somebody too much 
Chorus
Girl
You know you got me wrapped up

Bridge 
I'll never give you up I'll never stop craving
You're the one I want and I'm not afraid to say it
I'm needin your touch I just can't get enough 

Chorus
You got me fiendin for your body
You got me skeemin on your honey
Question: is it possible to love somebody too much 
Chorus
Girl
You know you got me wrapped up

I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie live a lie live a lie


And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine
Because when I arrive
I I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is forgot
I must now remind you
Let It Rock Let It Rock Let It Rock


Now the sun's disgraced
I see you're 'bout to run away
Knew my fame was fate
When I'm gone for too long

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine
Because when I arrive
I I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is forgot
I must now remind you
Let It Rock Let It Rock Let It Rock


I am here to stay Yeah
I am here to stay Yeah

They can't but my clique up
And if you don't feel us
That means you're realer than fake
The thriller in Manila
We ge-realer than jake
Got nothin' to hide
Lookin' at you sideways
Saying "Do you got a lighter"
And with the right attire just
Lookin' for a buyer
But I'll make you a survivor
Blow a pound of that dro
And you'll see clouds of smoke
I'll be that I know
Flooded all my ice
Now I'm on the roll
I just want to make you scream
Michael Jackson "Ah" Oh my god that's dope


And you take your time Yeah
And you do your crime Uh-huh
Well you made your bed
I made mine
Because when I arrive
I I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is forgot
I must now remind you
Let It Rock Let It Rock Let It Rock


Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Verse 1: The Game
Damn they don't make 'em like this no more I ask 'cause I'm not sure Do anybody make real shit anymore
Bowties in the building waving chilling with Top and Suge Biggie 'bout to hit the stage
Everybody screaming "RIP the legend" while I'm screaming out "Make way for the new king of the west my nigga" K Dot and Q ain't feelin' you nigga And that's factual next time you speak on a Crip nigga watch your mouth Hoover Street we know for sticking our chest out
Baller blocking hard come and test us out

Grammys they've seen it all hey what's up Marine
I'm West coasting my name is good in every hood
No chains on my shoulders I feel the same way as every good
Inglewood South Central out to Queens
Few marble floors with a couple of my favorite teams
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
But there's no place to go no place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
Can't escape the pain inside
I'm still in the projects where the haters know
I'm barricaded in my city I'm a hostage oh yeah
Verse 2: Lil Wayne
Uh I'm the prince of the south
I'm crowding and pounding the pavement
This is where legends are made sick and I'm fading
Haters can save it I blow 'em like bombs in the basement
Blow for blow I can take it
But I know you can't take it
Class it like Kiff fly like a blimp
Momma ain't raised no quitter raised on K-Swiss and shrimp
Money is the motive fuck it if it's anybody's
I got an AK-47 and I'm finna' catch a body
Pussy-ass niggas get snatched up quickly
I dare a motherfucker try to jack me
I'm with J-R and Young G we got racks on racks on racks
The team is who I thank my money and my rank
I'm in the Ghost like Pac and them
I keep a +40 glock and them
Boy I got the key to the game
The only thing I ain't got is chains
Cause I'm unbelievable better yet unbelievable
Ink from my pen is like a fetus in the womb motherfucker
You can have the fame I'll be the king
I'll say some shit that'll leave you with more scars than dimples
Got niggas that got life in prison won't talk to the jakes
I dropped a diamond in the rough the diamond still remains in the cup
Nigga what
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
But there's no place to go no place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
Can't escape the pain inside
I'm still in the projects where the haters know
I'm barricaded in my city I'm a hostage oh yeah

The flock why ask why keep the five alive  
So Willie D can drive til we reach the sky  
See I be killin' time  
While she killin' thyme no Rosemary  
We wine and dine  
Beat it up like Rampage when I hit that stage  
Nothin' but satin and strawberries on my nuts like Sega  
She pause I paint her face like a portrait  
Got them other niggas blowin' on her like car horns  
Tattoo my name on her heart She bringin' Wayne to her job  
And every time she don't steal but she steal my heart  
Oops did I say that

When I'm hittin' that from behind  
And I'll be right back  
Girl yeah that's right that's just how we do it  

  
Look she got a fine hair stylist  
But her attitude make me not even wanna tip her  
Grass cut low I'm lookin' like a lama  
Still ridin' solo I'm the topic of discussion  
Now the rumors are like  Cause they hatin' just because they was cuffin'  
I'm tryna tell her let me love ya  
I'll be here forever and forever just ain't enough  
Like a sweeter than a cinnamon apple  
She a wholesome young lady but stunning  
A player like me be crushin'  
But all I need is just 5 minutes  
She's a work of art that Van Gogh couldn't make  
I'm goin' in like the SAS  
And she holdin' me tight like a cast  
The neighbors complainin' and sayin'  
Ms Officer you better cuff him  
But I ain't alarmed ice on my neck  
Like a main character in the movie makin' the screen wet  
And they wait for Kidd like the first and the fifteenth  
Mrs Officer I see you

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Addicted" by Saving Abel:

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Or the sound you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

Oh girl lets take it slow
So as for you well you know where to go
I want to take my love with you
To the grave

But it's hard to live
With the memories
And keep a straight face
When I'm begging you to stay yeah

And oh Such a beautiful face
Is nothing when she's gone
You'll cry a little more
Hear the lies that I have sworn

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Or the sound you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

Yeah

Oh girl I gotta let you know
I'm paralyzed without your touch
I need you so much
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Or the sound you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

Oh girl lets take it slow
So as for you well you know where to go
I want to take my love with you
To the grave

I'm addicted to your touch
Take me into the night
Out of the house and into the real world
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me into the night

Out of the house and into the real world
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me into the night

You got the moves to make me smile
You got the moves to make me wish I stayed
You got the moves to make me stay
Hey

Lift me into the night
Out of the house and into the real world
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Lift me into the night

Out of the house and into the real world
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me into the night

You got the moves to make me smile
You got the moves to make me wish I stayed
You got the moves to make me stay

Take me into the night
Out of the house and into the real world
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me into the night

Lift me into the night

You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you PMS like a bitch I would know
And you overthink always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me


'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down


You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up


You don't really wanna stay no
But you don't really wanna go oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down


We used to be just like twins so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change


Someone call the doctor got a case of love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster can't get off this ride
You're changing your mind like a girl changes clothes

I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T do you know what that means
She got her own house she got her own car
Two job work hard you a bad broad
If you ain't on sit down you on my throne
Get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up

First I buy her a drink then I tell her I need her
And I'm feeling on her thighs she say that she's a reader
Her body's a stage and I'm fixin' to be her speaker
Me and my girl chillindependent on the weekend
Sometimes I tell her I'm sorry and she tell me she sorry
We work it out then fall asleep and wake up in the morning
Middle of the night I hear her moan she say"Turn off the phone"
Treat her like a queen never been to Rome
But I'll take her when I get the chance
Flowers for Valentine's ya'll can go to plans
See they got me in a trance first glance felt like I was in a trance
That's how it is I'm serious
I can't even lie I be in the sky
I be so friggin' high but ain't no lie
She don't like to drive in the streets
She don't like the way that I roll my weed
But she don't fuss or complain– she loves a gangsta
Plus thinkin' like a boss man I gotta thank her
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
She do it all cause she was sent she don't rely on 
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
Do you know what that mean When I tell her that I love her she says thank you and cleans
Sometimes I swear that I'm the man sometime I'm just hopeless
And it ain't nothin' she can't do in fact she's so focused
I watch her do her hair she know that I'ma notice
Them boys all stop and stare she independent that's why I chose this
In love with a beauty queen only thing we did was had sex
In my room with no music on that's awkward
Only thing we hit was a bad connect
Stick around my battery dead
But still she holdin' me down she cold with the head
I'm in love with a stripper it's not just a song
I'm in love with a girl she deep off in my phone
I been in love with her but I aint say it
Can't find another girl to replace her
Girl is amazing loving my baby I'm in love with a thug's wife
Got me thinking 'bout her every moment thinking 'bout her every night
Thinking 'bout her every morning on the flight
Thinking 'bout her thinking 'bout her then I'm falling aight
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
Do you know what that means 
She got her own house she got her own car
Two job work hard you a bad broad
If you ain't on sit down you on my throne
Get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up

Yo you out your league baby but you a baller
If you ask me heartbreaker when she walk past me
Niggas tellin' me when I'm with her to act like imma have her
Maybe that's another story 'bout a different disaster
I'm independent but me not having her that's a different story
I like a girl that can scratch off all my itches for me
And maybe some other tings
A girl that I can call my own a girl that's chillin' like me
Knows what she's feeling like me
I promise that I'ma try to ever let anything come in between us
Boosie I'ma ride drive and kiss or die
We gotta stick together until the morning come
We got mamas turning grandmothers sisters and brothers
For the Black and Gold after Hurricane Katrina
I got a letter from my folks like "Boosie be careful they hate you"
I got a text from my baby's mom telling me about the drama in the city
Independent but on nights like this I roll with 'em
Want the finer things in life so I give 'em
But how independent are we
She asked a fuckin' question so I answered
Don't be asking me shit then act like you don't want to know
Independent ain't easy but I'm living though
Momma I really ain't solo I'm just on my mind grind
Daddy must've showed her the ropes

She got her own house she got her own car
Two job work hard you a bad broad
If you ain't on sit down you on my throne
Get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up

Independent chicken in my zone
That one that knows how to get her money on
Got her own band so she don't need yours
In the kitchen cooking crab legs turning on my stove
When I'm out in public she hold it down
No need to visit ladies' room she goes down
P*ssy so good had to get her a crown
Gave her head in a coupe called her the talk of the town
Independent but she going to pay my bills
Come baby put your name on these handles
Try confessing love cause I ain't looking for love
And I'll walk a thousand miles if you come stay with me
Give me lovin' every night and day
Oh you fly that's why I'm f*ckin' with you anyway
Say you got me out here come lay with me
Just let the night hold you close don't be afraid of me
Won't you hold my hand Won't you come stand with me
Sure togetherness in my life baby just work with me

She got her own house she got her own car
Two job work hard you a bad broad
If you ain't on sit down you on my throne
Get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up
Yeah Jonas Brothers
We back
Uh-huh
Chain gleamin' uh-huh
Lookin' fly uh-huh
When I walk in uh-huh
Hear me say uh-huh
"Heyo"
Baby let me love you down
There's so many ways to love ya
Baby I can break you down
There's so many ways to love ya
Got me like uh-huh

Ain't nothin' gonna stop me
'me burstin' up

All the lights
Couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up my path
Baby it's alright
Darkness ain't a fright
To us oh hey
Girl I see it in you
You're livin' a lie
And your boyfriend ain't gotta clue
If you're alone pick up your phone

Pickin' up dust lettin' the dirt fall below
Kickin' up rust follow the bouncing glow

This is the uncensored lyrics of "It's Not My Time" by 3 Doors Down:

Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and love and all of our friends

Living life like an ocean
But now the currents slowly pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under

Can you save me from this
'Cause it's not my time I'm not going
There's a fear in me and it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know ooh but I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take them away

Oh but I'm taking them back
All this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me oh oh

But now I do
And all that you've given me
I'll cherish it all
And the closer I get I'll say

'Cause it's not my time I'm not going
There's a fear in me and it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know

Ooh but I won't go
I won't go
I won't go

Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and love and all of our friends

Living life like an ocean
But now the currents slowly pulling me down
Down oh down
Slowly pulling me down
Verse 1:
You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

Chorus:
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you you you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

Verse 2:
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

Chorus:
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you you you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

Bridge:
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try try to divide
Something so real so till the end of time I'm telling you

Chorus:
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you you you

Outro:
Oh oh oh oh

Movin' at the speed of light into eternity yeah
Tonight is the night
To join me in the middle of ecstasy


Feel the melody in the rhythm of the music around you around you
I'm gonna take you there I'm gonna take you there
So don't be scared I'm right here baby
We can go anywhere go anywhere
But first it's your chance
Take my hand come with me


It's like I waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me you and the dance floor
'Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure double your fun
And dance forever ever ever

Verse 1:
Oh I had a lot to say
Was thinking on my time away
I miss you and things weren't the same
‘Cause everything inside it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me wanna die

Chorus:
I'm sorry I'm bad I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry 'bout all things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go 'round
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry

Verse 2:
This time I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
We get older and blame turns to shame
‘Cause everything inside it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me wanna die

Chorus:
I'm sorry I'm bad I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go 'round
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry

Bridge:
Every single day I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried it's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah sorry

Chorus:
I'm sorry I'm bad I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry 'bout all things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go 'round
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry
I'm sorry baby I'm sorry baby
Yeah I'm sorry
If I had no labels censorship or commentary the lyrics of "Like You'll Never See Me Again" by Alicia Keys would be:

If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had
Was it everything that you were looking for
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have left
And I don't wanna forget forget how to love

Like we never loved before
It's like you're my everything
uh I choose to be with you
No matter what they say
It's like heaven to me
I know it's cliche'd to say
But I'll say it anyway

Thank you baby
For loving me like you do
It's like you gave me wings
And I don't know if can survive
But I know I'm gonna try
Thank you thank you thank you
Falling so deep
So deep in love with you baby
How you're touch set me free baby set me free
It's like I it's like I'm losing my mind losing my mind
Thank you thank you thank you

And it's like it's like I'm living someone els's life
It's like it's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
'Cause this was not your dream
But you always believe in me

Another winter day has come and gone away
In either Paris or Rome
And I wanna go home
Mmmmmm
May be surrounded by a million people
I still feel alone
I just wanna go home
Oh I miss you you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
"I'm fine baby how are you"
Well I'd send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
Mmmmmmm
I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home
It's like it's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
'Cause this was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come and gone away
And even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people
I still feel alone
Oh let go home
Oh I miss you you know

Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby I'm done
I gotta go home
Let me go home
It will all be all right
I'll be home tonight

I do it for the ladies
I gotta keep it hood
Where we at Polo Ayy
I see you right
Ladies yeah
These niggas twisting the game
We don't bend or fold though
She said "What's up What's up"
I said "Let's slide"
Then I'm outside yeah
The V-Twelve five five
Got her running like she in a exercise
We make songs that make women wanna jump
Shawty got me blowing up a snare drum
Elementary then she want a Shirley Temple
I'm like "Okay what's entwined to simple"
Bleeding out the coupe with a blunt in my hand
I'm turning her off you can see it from my eyes
I'm the King nigga with Young Queen
Kush OG pimpin' I lean
Black and mil' coupe they call it Phanton
Top your Phantom in my Monday clothes
It's like I'm what's happening
And what's up relaxin' let's go
 Yeah it's ya man Young

At the bar
Got a fist full of dollars
She might get down make a nigga wanna holler
Got a glass full of Bub
So pardon my manners
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
How she fit in the dress I'm trying to get up in
Her legs wrapped around me I'm trying to swim
All up in that ocean deeper than the sea
I ain't talking 'bout no bottoms
I'm talking 'bout you and me
Time flying catch her we can see
Going down backwards "I'm a PIMP"
Rock star pipe plus I got the Rock star life
Plus Just to top it off
I'm hoping off the back of the bike
I'm kind of like a big deal
I'm like a really big deal
Can't lie it feels good to be in this museum
Young boss valet open up my doors
Black card at the party with my name on the front or

I wanna make love in this club yeah
In this club yeah in this club yeah
I wanna make love in this club yeah
In this club yeah in this club yeah

I wanna make love in this club yeah
In this club yeah in this club yeah
Ah ah 
I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "7 Things" by Miley Cyrus:

Sha sha sha

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared

It was awesome but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear
My dear

The 7 things I hate about you
The 7 things I hate about you oh you
You're vain your games you're insecure
You love me you like her
You make me laugh you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks
And when you act like them just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and it's silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now
Is your sincere apology

And when you mean it I'll believe it
If you text it I'll delete it
Let's be clear oh
I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here

The 7 things I hate about you
You're vain your games you're insecure
You love me you like her
You make me laugh you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks
And when you act like them just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

Compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the 7 that I like

The 7 things I like about you
Your hair your eyes your old Levi's
And when we kiss I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

You do oh
Sha sha
Sha sha

Young Money you dig
Mack I'm going in
A millionaire I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil I leak on the sheet
Of the tablet in my mind cause I don't write shit
Cause I ain't got time cause my seconds minutes hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-ch-ch-ch-chopper
Sister brother son daughter father motha fuck a copper
Got the Masarati dancin' on a bridge pussy poppin' telecopic
Read or die the reports of my demise are greatly exaggerated
Bitch I'm the bomb like tick tick
 Now just imagine how it feels
To step on the big booty of a hydraulic heels
I'm CO-M-I-N-G

A milli a milli a milli a milli a milli
And I'ma millionaire I'm a Young Money millionaire
A milli a milli a milli a milli a milli
A millionaire I'm a Young Money millionaire

Okay I'm goin' back in
Comin' back clean again
I understand I'm the boss y'all just the middleman
It's Brook-Lan' finest C-C-Carter bein' handsome
Been in a minute Mommy and Phillipe's still gamblin'
Lucky Lefty catch me paintin' pictures
My vision's vivid you dig
Sorry for the wait now my diva's missing I'm busy
Fucks gettin' thrown in her direction dizzy
But is it real love if it ain't rough
You're the fucking reason that I ain't trust
Done with you so

A milli a milli a milli a milli a milli
And I'ma millionaire I'm a Young Money millionaire
A milli a milli a milli a milli a milli
A millionaire I'm a Young Money millionaire

Now let me get this straight wait I'm the rookie
But my features and my shows ten times your pay
50K for a verse no album out
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate violent
Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it wylin'
Nicki on them tit-ties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget "Barbie" fuck Nicki she's fake she's on a diet
But my pockets eatin' cheesecake every day
You can suck my diz-nik if you take this jeezy way
How you doin I'm Lil Wayne I'm a nuisance I go stupid I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi I'm the shit no I'm pollution no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies pause
in my jacuzzi pussy juicy I never gave a fuck about a hater got money on my radar
Dress like it's still '96 I'ma kill these hoes

A milli a milli a milli a milli a milli
And I'ma millionaire I'm a Young Money millionaire
A milli a milli a milli a milli a milli
A millionaire I'm a Young Money millionaire
Verse 1:
I'm not lovin' you way I wanted to
What I had to do had to run from you
I'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me all the way home
So ya never know never never know
Never know enough till it's over love
Till we lose control system overload
Screamin' "No no no n-no"

Chorus:
I'm not lovin' you way I wanted to
See I wanna move but can't escape from you
So I keep it low keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

Verse 2:
So keep ya love lockdown your love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown your love lockdown
Now-Now keep ya love lockdown your love lockdown
Now-Now keep ya love lockdown you lose

Verse 3:
I can't keep on survivin' on love
Do-do-do-do-do-do
I can't keep on survivin' on love
Do-do-do-do-do-do

Chorus:
I'm not lovin' you way I wanted to
See I had to go see I had to move
No more wastin' time we can't wait for life
We're just waitin' to die
 x 3

Verse 4:
So keep ya love lockdown your love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown your love lockdown
Now-Now keep ya love lockdown your love lockdown
Now-Now keep ya love lockdown you lose

Outro:
I'm not lovin' you way I wanted to
I met no one new I got no one new
No I said I'm through but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin' keep the lovin' goin'
Keep it on a roll only God knows
If I be with you baby I'm confused
You choose you choose
