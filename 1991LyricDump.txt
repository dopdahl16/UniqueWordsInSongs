Look into my eyes – you will see  
What you mean to me  
Search your heart search your soul  
And when you find me there you'll search no more  

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for  
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for  
You know it's true  
Everything I do – I do it for you  

Look into your heart – you will find  
There's nothin' there to hide  
Take me as I am – take my life  
I would give it all – I would sacrifice  

Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for  
I can't help it – there's nothin' I want more  
Ya know it's true  
Everything I do – I do it for you  

There's no love – like your love  
And no other – could give more love  
There's nowhere – unless you're there  
All the time – all the way  

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for  
I can't help it – there's nothin' I want more  
I would fight for you – I'd lie for you  
Walk the wire for you – ya I'd die for you  

Ya know it's true  
Everything I do – I do it for you

The jam is live in effect and I don’t waste time
Off the mic with a dope rhyme jump
Rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords strings we brings
Melody G-Funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

If you're not swift you'll slip
And if you slip you'll be caught by the hip
So slip up your lip just like I’m doing
Sing song ping pong rhythm is the thing
Big bands small bands back up vocals horns
I got all y’all just sit back and watch

I’m gonna make you sweat till you bleed
Is that dope enough Indeed
I paid the price I control the dice
I’m more precise to the point I’m nice
Let me suffice to say that I am the boss
And this be my day so let the funk roll
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon

Verse 1:
He's whispered in my ear
Things that I shouldn't hear
He tells me that he loves me
And that I'm going to be his
Tonight

Chorus:
Rush rush
Hurry hurry lover come to me
Rush rush
I wanna see I wanna see ya get free with me

Verse 2:
He whispers softly to me
And all the way he moans
Words of pure extasy
Bring me bring me home
Tonight

Chorus

Bridge:
I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face
I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm going to get away
I hear those words that make me stay

Verse 3:
He says that he needs me
And he wants to make me his
He promises he'll treat me right
And that he'll never miss
Tonight

Chorus x2
What the f*** is happening to me
I'm dying from the inside
Body hurts too much to feel
Pressure adds to insult
Speaking in a foreign tongue
Help me help me what's the matter
Nothing nothing you're all insane
Chorus:
Everything is Unbelievable
Nothing seems to be the way that it should
Everything is Unbelievable
Incredulity tenacity atrocities
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something new
Am I wasting all my time
In my search for truth
Going round in circles
While I search for myself
I don't know what's going on
Does anybody else know anything 
Chorus 
Chorus 2:
Everything is Unbelievable
When we do believe we suffer
Everything is Unbelievable
Incredulity tenacity atrocities
Everything is Unbelievable
When we do believe we suffer
Everything is Unbelievable
Incredulity tenacity atrocities

Verse 1:
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Chorus:
Someday ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Verse 2:
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying you should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Chorus:
Someday ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You're only longing for the love you've known

From a distance
The world looks blue and green
And the snow-capped mountains white
From a distance
The ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance
There is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance
We all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns
No bombs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance
We are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance
You look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance
I cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for

From a distance
There is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

It's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
This is the song of every man
And God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "All the Man That I Need" by Whitney Houston: 

I used to cry myself to sleep at night  
But that was all before he came  
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right  
But now he's here  
It's not the same it's not the same  

He fills me up  
He gives me love  
More love than I've ever seen  
He's all I've got  
He's all I've got in this world  
But he's all the man that I need  

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes  
He takes me down and rocks me slow  
And in the evening when the moon is high  
He holds me close and won't let go  
He won't let go  

He fills me up  
He gives me love  
More love than I've ever seen  
He's all I've got  
He's all I've got in this world  
But he's all the man that I need  

Oh and in the winter when the snow  
Comes down in flakes  
And the wind can make a grown man shake  
He wraps me up in his arms  
And sees me through  
Anything that life may bring  
He'll see me through  

He fills me up  
He gives me love  
More love than I've ever seen  
He's all I've got  
He's all I've got in this world  
But he's all the man that I need  

He fills me up  
He gives me love  
More love than I've ever seen  
He's all I've got  
He's all I've got in this world  
But he's all the man that I need
Baby you should know by now
That I'm by your side every night and every day
I adore I adore I adore
Yeah

Baby can I touch you there
In the morning light
Or let me kiss you yeah
Just wanna hold you babe ayy

Cuz girl to me you're like a dream come true
A dream to me you're all I need
Baby you're everything I've ever wanted in a woman
I could never see baby with anyone else but you

Cuz you're the reason why I sing this song
And you're the reason why my heart beats all night long
And we've got something that's real special girl
This love that we share is ours alone

I'll be standing here waitin' for you
Until the end of time girl
I'll be waiting I adore you waiting I adore you
Waiting I adore you waiting I adore you

Yeah yeah
I adore I adore I adore
Baby I adore you yeah
I adore I adore I adore
Every little thing about you baby
Verse 1:
Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow

Work it out

Chorus:
They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I'm alive and well
And still going strong

Verse 2:
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
'Cause it's all about the dog in me
I wanna love you the best that the best that I can

Love is a game of give and take
I'm tired of all this to and fro
To and fro expanse
They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow

Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me and baby I got you
Babe

Chorus:
Babe I'm alive and I'm a woman
I'm a livin' lovin' woman
And you're the only man who really knows me

Verse 3:
They say that love is a circle
But that ain't the way that we found it no no
'Cause love can get you so high so high
And love can drag you down so low

They say love is a stairway
And baby you're my steppin' stone
So lead me baby lead me by the hand

And we'll take a step or two take a step or two
And we'll keep on lovin' keep on lovin'
We'll keep on lovin' keep on lovin'
We'll keep on lovin'

Chorus:
Love will never do never do
Without you you you without you
Oh love will never do never do
Without you you you without you

Outro:
Love will never do
Never do never do
Without you
No no no no never do never do
Love will never do
Never do never do
Without you
No no no no never do never do
Love will never do
Never do never do
Without you
No no no no never do never do
Love will never do
Never do never do
Without you
No no no no never do never do
I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what so now what
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping praying
For you to justify my love
I want to know you
Not like that
I don't want to be your mother
I don't want to be your sister either
I just want to be your lover
I want to be your baby
Kiss me that's right kiss me
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
Yearning burning
For you to justify my love
What are you going to do
What are you going to do
Talk to me — tell me your dreams
Am I in them
Tell me your fears
Are you scared
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me that's right love me
I want to be your baby
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love
To justify my love
Wanting to justify
Waiting to justify my love
Praying to justify
To justify my love
I'm open to justify my love
To justify my love
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Emotions" by Mariah Carey:

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love

Intoxicated
Flying high

It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so high
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of

Higher than the heavens above

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I'm so glad you're my friend
I know our friendship will never end
I see you in my dreams every night
You're in my thoughts I hold you tight

So you wanna stay with me in the morning
You wanna hold me when I sleep

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Every Heartbeat" by Amy Grant:

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

Monday hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup I'm out the door
Yeah the freeway's standing still today
It's gonna make me late and that's for sure

I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it too much to do
I'm rushing 'round and stressing out
And it's got me thinking why don't I
Do the things I know I should do

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps calling and I keep on falling
Over and over again

This beat is inside it's so loud that I just can't hide
Every time it starts I get this feeling
Every time every time

Saturday I'm running wild
Gonna hit the club gonna have some fun
Maybe hook up with some friends I know
And rock the night away until the sun

I'm running out of time; I'm out of control
Weekends just come and go they slip away
I'm chasing down the avenue
And it's got me thinking why don't I
Do the things that I know I should do

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps calling and I keep on falling
Over and over again

This beat is inside it's so loud that I just can't hide
Every time it starts I get this feeling
Every time every time

Every time every time
Every time every time
Every time every time

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it too much to do
I'm rushing 'round and stressing out
And it's got me thinking why don't I
Do the things I know I should do

Every time I turn around
I think I've got it all figured out
My heart keeps calling and I keep on falling
Over and over again

This beat is inside it's so loud that I just can't hide
Every time it starts I get this feeling
Every time every time

Oh life is bigger it's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much I set it up


That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight I'm
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much I haven't said enough


I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream


That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight I'm
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much I haven't said enough


But that was just a dream
That was just a dream


But that was just a dream
Try cry why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream just a dream
Dream
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "It Ain't Over 'til It's Over" by Lenny Kravitz:


Here we are still together
We are one so much time wasted
Playing games with love
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over


So many storms we've been through
So many tears we've cried
Yet here we stand still together
With a love that's meant to be
Baby it ain't over 'til it's over


How many times did we give up
But we always worked things out
And all my doubts and fears
They all just fade away
When I'm with you oh baby
So don't give up on us baby no no no


So many storms we've been through
So many tears we've cried
Yet here we stand still together
With a love that's meant to be
Baby it ain't over 'til it's over


So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over


So many storms we've been through
So many tears we've cried
Yet here we stand still together
With a love that's meant to be
Baby it ain't over 'til it's over


Keep the faith
Love is all around you
Stay alive
And love will find a way
So I'm asking you now
Where do I go from here
When all I can seem to do
Is shed another tear

I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fading
If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two

I would be strong enough to hold you in my arms
I would be strong enough to let go

Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside

Where do all the lonely hearts go
Where do all the lonely hearts go

Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give up their fight

I see it in your eyes
That no matter what happens
I'll stand by you
If ever you should call

And if I lose your love
I know I would break down and cry
Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside

Where do all the lonely hearts go
Where do all the lonely hearts go

Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside

Where do all the lonely hearts go
Where do all the lonely hearts go
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Summertime" by DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince:


Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Verse 1:
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony of all that hardcore dance
That has gotten to be a little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime


Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Verse 2:
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
A back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressing less
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan stting on Lorenzo's
Back in Philly we be ou in the park
A place called the plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out hunting and girls doing likewise
Honking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beeping at
It's like the summer's a natural afrodesiac 


Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Verse 3:
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old time sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a bbq that's starting at 4
Sitting with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growing up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill can spark up nostalgia
All the kids playing out front little boys messing round
With the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion


Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer summer summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
There's a thing that I carry in my heart
And it's never far from thought
I feel it every time we touch
Every time it starts

It's what I do I believe love will see me through
I'm yours for life this love I feel inside
Is something special that I just can't hide
There's a promise of a new day

I can feel it can you feel it oh
There's a promise of a new day

I can see it can you see it oh
Coming our way yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Can't you see that I want you
Stay with me through the night
Passions ignite

There's a place where we can go
Where love's more than you'll ever know
Cast away your fears and doubts

Love will find a way

There's a promise of a new day

I can feel it can you feel it oh
There's a promise of a new day

I can see it can you see it oh
Coming our way yeah

Oh yeah yeah yeah Can you feel it can you feel it
There's a promise of a new day I can see I can see I can see it
Coming our way yeah I can see it coming our way
In a time where the sun descends alone
I ran a long long way from home
To find a heart that's made of stone
I will try I just need a little time
To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes
Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower
Tell me why
Every time you walk away
You take a piece of me with you
If you don't see me anymore
It's not your fault
I'm fading
The day and night I follow no one
I march to the beat of my own drum
I'm a butterfly ain't got no gun
I will try I just need a little time
To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes
Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower
Every time you walk away
You take a piece of me with you
If you don't see me anymore
It's not your fault
I'm fading
You say I'm miles and miles from where you are
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower
Every time you walk away
You take a piece of me with you
If you don't see me anymore
It's not your fault
I'm fading
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Hole Hearted" by Extreme:

There's a hole in my heart that I'm hiding
And I can't let you know
It's a hole in my heart and I'm crying
And I can't let it show

I'm a puppet then please tell me
Why do I feel so alive
If they're playing then please tell me
Why do I feel like I'm dying

If I'm in love with you
Then why can't I come
And say it to your face
If I'm a man in love
Then why do I feel so weak

If I stand up to you
Then why am I on my knees
If I'm a man in love
Then why do I feel like I'm losing

There's a hole in my heart and it's growing
And I'm trying to fill it up
But it's far beyond repair
And there's nothing left to tear

If I'm in love with you
Then why can't I come
And say it to your face
If I'm a man in love
Then why do I feel so weak

If I stand up to you
Then why am I on my knees
If I'm a man in love
Then why do I feel like I'm losing

If I'm in love with you
Then why can't I come
And say it to your face
If I'm a man in love
Then why do I feel like I'm losing
Why do I feel like I'm losing
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Power of Love/Love Power" by Luther Vandross:

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It'll be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Love me tender love me true
And never let me go
Hoo never let me go

When i'm by myself
I can think of all the love that we share
And always be myself

'Cause I know that when I need you
I can simply call you up
And you will always be there

Because of love love
I know better things are coming our way
Because of our love love

No matter what may come our way
I'm gonna find love every day
And we'll rise above love

We'll rise above the clouds
Our hearts will be singing
I know love gonna take us
And lead the way

Can't nobody stop us
Nobody can stop us
Our love will show us the way

I feel the power
I feel the power
I feel the power
The power of love

I feel the power
I feel the power
I feel the power
The power of love
Verse 1:
Birds fly they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means

The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture

Chorus:
Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love love is a wonderful thing

Verse 2:
Walls seem to fall all around
When you're feeling strong
But when your heart is weak
You're just hanging on

Don't let the world outside outside
Get the best of you
When you need someone
Special there to help you through

Chorus:
Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love love is a wonderful thing

Bridge:
So hold on never let go
Love will show us everything
So hold on never let go
Love will show us everything

Chorus:
Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love love is a wonderful thing
Things That Make You Go Hmmm by C+C Music Factory:

"Yo let me ask you a question
What do you think of this
What do you think of that

Well I'm not into opium
Got a different way of kickin' it
But you just might be surprised
By what you find in this bag

Because the things that make you go hmmm
Is not a mystery
All we're doin' is checkin' the MCs
Off the list that we've made
Rock shock and party never dropping
We're the MCs that are simply amazing

While you're listenin' to the unclear
Now steer your self clear
Of the fear that's been put into your heart
By the media and those who play a part
In trying to keep us all down
And trying to keep on trying
To keep us underground

But they can't deny us
And they can't dictate to us
We are a part of the rhythm nation
Our strength is in our unity
So come on brothers and sisters
Let's try to make it right

The things that make you go hmmm
Is not a mystery
All we're doin' is checkin' the MCs
Off the list that we've made
Rock shock and party never dropping
We're the MCs that are simply amazing

So let's grab a piece of parchment
Put it under lock and key
We'll write down on that paper
What we want the world to see

Because the things that make you go hmmm
Is not a mystery
All we're doin' is checkin' the MCs
Off the list that we've made
Rock shock and party never dropping
We're the MCs that are simply amazing"

A fool could see just how much I adore thee
I get down on my knees I'd do anything for you

When I think about you I touch myself
Ooh I don't want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Ooh I don't want anybody else
Oh no oh no oh no

Repeat until fade
People are talking talking 'bout people  
I hear them whisper you won't believe it  
They think we're lovers kept undercover  
I just ignore it but they keep saying  
We laugh just a little too loud  
We stand just a little too close  
We stare just a little too long  
Maybe they're seeing something we don't darling

Let's give them something to talk about  
Let's give them something to talk about  
Let's give them something to talk about  
How about love love love love  

I feel so foolish I never noticed  
You act so nervous could you be falling for me  
It took a rumor to make me wonder  
Now I'm convinced I'm going under  
Thinking 'bout you every day  
Dreaming 'bout you every night  
Hoping that you feel the same way  
Now that we know it let's really show it darling  

Let's give them something to talk about  
A little mystery to figure out  
Let's give them something to talk about  
How about love love love love  

Listen to the radio talkin' 'bout the last show  
Someone got excited had to call the state militia  
Wanna do a little sidestep now or the later  
Gonna take a little tumble ain't no harm in it  
Let's give them something to talk about  
A little mystery to figure out  
Let's give them something to talk about  
How about love love love love  

Let's give them something to talk about baby  
A little mystery won't hurt 'em  
Let's give them something to talk about  
How about our love love love love

I said play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right

Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die oh yeah

But my pen was jammed and stuck
And I'm missing every minute of the day
And suzy baby you gotta move

And do the Cat Daddy to the big payback
Said play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right yeah

Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die

Changing Rock and Roll and minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now it's so much better
It's so much better you know
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' no
Of how I learned my lesson that day
When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy

When the world is so unfair

Every night I say a prayer in the hopes that there's a Heaven

And every day I'm more confused as the saints turn into sinners

All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay

And I feel this empty place inside so afraid that I've lost my faith

Show me the way show me the way

Take me tonight to the river and wash my illusions away

Show me the way show me the way

Give me the strength and the courage to believe that I'll get there someday

And please show me the way

Every night I say a prayer in the hopes that there's a Heaven

And every day I'm more confused as the saints turn into sinners

All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay

And I feel this empty place inside so afraid that I've lost my faith

Show me the way show me the way

Take me tonight to the mountain and tell me what there is to see

Show me the way show me the way

And heal me from all the things that I've done to make me who I am today

And please show me the way

Show me the way show me the way

Take me tonight to the river and wash my illusions away

Show me the way show me the way

Give me the strength and the courage to believe that I'll get there someday

And please show me the way

Every night I say a prayer in the hopes that there's a Heaven
Fumbling for words while trying to find
A way to tell you how I feel
I've got this longing in my heart
But I'm afraid the words aren't clear
An empty silence fills my head
As I wonder what to say
But I'll find the words to talk to you
And lead you to a better day

Love takes time to heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time

I don't wanna be here all alone
Struggling to find my way
My heart is empty and confused
And I don't know how to make it through
So it's time for me to move along
And try to find somebody new
But I'll never forget the love we shared
And the memories we've been through

Love takes time to heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time

No matter how hard I try
I can't escape the memories
And they still hold me captive girl
Even though you're not here with me
I don't know if I'm gonna make it
'Cause the pain inside is all I see
But I'll find the strength to let you go
And learn to live again baby

Love takes time to heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time

Love takes time to heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could have been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could have been some perfume

Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell
The way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could have been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a cool crook
And baby you're so smart
You know you could have been a schoolbook

Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell
The way you do the things you do

You've made my life so rich
You know you could have been some money
And baby you're so sweet

You know I could have been a cowboy
And if you were beside me yeah
You know I could have been a joy

Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell
The way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do

The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

Here I am baby come and take me
Take me by the hand oh show me
Here I am baby it feels like the sun
Wants you have begun

I can't believe that it's real
A love that we can feel
I just wanna hold you baby
Love come home to me

Here I am baby come and take me
Take me by the hand oh show me
Here I am baby it feels like the sun
Wants you have begun

Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby oh show me
Here I am baby it feels like the sun
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby oh show me
Here I am baby it feels like the sun

These four walls they whisper to me
They know a secret I knew they would not keep
Didn't take long for the room to fill with dust
And these four walls came down around us


Must have been something sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence
'Cause it's all that you left
Just photographs and memories of what we've had
And that's all that you left for me


And these four walls darken swallow me
And then I'm falling down again
And then I'm crawling again
These four walls close me within
And I'm trying to breathe but I can't get air
Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
And now I'm praying for the strength to leave


Must have been something sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence
'Cause it's all that you left
Just photographs and memories of what we've had
And that's all that you left for me


But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Must have been something sent me out of my head
With the words so radical and not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence
'Cause it's all that you left
Just photographs and memories of what we've had
And that's all that you left for me
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Crazy" by Seal:

In a church by the face
He talks about the people going under
Only child know
A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for
Is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fracture on that breaking wall
I see you my friend and touch your face again

Miracles will happen as we trip
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

Crazy are the people walking through my head
One of them got a gun to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Ohh get it get it get it yeah
If all were there when they're turning out the light
Then we'd all get just a little crazy
But we never had because we're too busy being sane
Yeah we're always waiting for the thrill

Cause I'm about to break out from "rationality"
Don't you know it is coming for "reality"
It's like I'm staring at those that who are doing it
Ah why can't we be like them

Miracles will happen as we trip
But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little crazy

No no never survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No no never survive
Unless we are a little crazy

Ohh a chance operation
A chance operation yeah

Crazy
But that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

Crazy
But that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train…

Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promise land
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hand

Some say he's a good man
But Lord I think he's lyin'
Scandalizin' victimizin'
Without your knowledge Robin Hood

We need someone to believe in
We need someone to trust
We need someone to believe in
We need we need we need
Someone to trust

I'm a speakin' from experience
And I'm here to testify
I was taken for everything
And all I left was my pride

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Ahh something to believe in

The nurse will tell you lies of a kingdom beyond the skies
But I am lost within this half world
It hardly seems to matter now

Yes I'm lost within this half world
It hardly seems to matter now

We need someone to believe in
We need someone to trust
We need someone to believe in
We need we need we need
Someone to trust

I'm a speakin' from experience
And I'm here to testify
I was taken for everything
And all I got was a bleeding hand

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Ahh something to believe in
The world was on fire
And no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No I don't want to fall in love This world is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love This world is only gonna break your heart

With you
With you

What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you

And I don't wanna fall in love This world is only gonna break your heart
No I don't wanna fall in love This world is only gonna break your heart
With you

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
No I don't wanna fall in love This world is only gonna break your heart
No I don't wanna fall in love This world is only gonna break your heart
No I nobody nobody This world is only gonna break your heart
No I nobody nobody This world is only gonna break your heart

Hush now don’t you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You’re lying safe in bed

Spinning in your head

Of someone close to you leaving the game
Of life so here it is another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over or has it just begun


There’s a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run to in the night
Relax child you were there
But only didn’t realize
And you were scared it’s a place where
You will learn to face your fears
Recover
Recover

Of someone close to you leaving the game

To me and Duke it's just a noun like horse or bat or chicken 

The first time I met this particular girl 
I'd never seen her before but she said "Hi my name is" 
I heard that so we got together 
A few days later I'm writin' her a letter

I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got

I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me

To win the race A prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV

But today the way I play the game is not the same
No way
Think I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be

Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true
Somehow

All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me

Yeah yeah freedom
I think you're gonna like it
I think you're gonna feel it
You won't believe it
I thought you'd seen it
We will never be wrong
Again
We can leave the old world behind
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
Again
Freedom
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Ooh it's hot so hot outside
And I don't know if it's me or just the light
But I'm all worked up and I toss and turn
And I just can't sleep at night


I'm feeling like a fool yeah
But I keep on dancing with the devil
I saw red I saw red I saw red
One more secret lover that I shot dead


Oh who's to blame who's to care
Well you know I never really wanted to go there
But you kept begging you just wouldn't leave
And I just wouldn't let you leave


I'm feeling like a fool yeah
But I keep on dancing with the devil
I saw red I saw red I saw red
One more secret lover that I shot dead


Ooh yeah
I saw red I saw red I saw red
One more little problem in my life




I'm feeling like a fool yeah
But I keep on dancing with the devil
I saw red I saw red I saw red
One more secret lover that I shot dead
I saw red I saw red I saw red
One more little problem in my life


Whose to blame who's to care
Well you know I never wanted to go there
Verse 1:
Well I'm staring into space to find
Someone who would treat me right
But all I find are lies and cheats
And players wrapped up tight

Chorus:
'Cause I'm miles away miles away
And I'm feeling so betrayed
I can't get through a single day
Without someone's heart being played

Verse 2:
Why does love have to be so hard
Why can't it be simple and pure
But it's always a game of chance
And I'm tired of being unsure

Chorus:
'Cause I'm miles away miles away
And I'm feeling so betrayed
I can't get through a single day
Without someone's heart being played

Bridge:
I thought I found the one a time or two
But they were all just passing through
Now I'm left with this shattered heart
Wondering where to even start

I can't get through a single day
Without someone's heart being played

Outro:
Well I'm staring into space to find

But all I find are lies and cheats
And players wrapped up tight

Gold and silver shine

Shiny happy people laughing

Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Motownphilly" by Boyz II Men:

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard not too soft

It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin' and boys are II Men

ABC BBD the East Coast Family
Never skipped a beat na-na-na-na-na-na

We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Them they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us flow a rush when the DJ's boomin' classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip hop records
He touched the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fatter joints called undergrounds
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change

Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede bombers

We party in cities towns villages and countries
I be reading Mikki D and I be listening to funk that's old school
We can cuss and fuss until the break of dawn
Cause we be getting streaking like the early morn

Strictly hip hop boy I ain't trying to sing
But I live giving props to those that paved the way for me
A tree recently found roots in hip hop
So when I rap my rhyme I'm glad it's all in the family

We're flowin' smooth enough like this and like that
We'll funk it up until we hear I'll House You scream
Boyz II Men break it down you know
We're doin' it like that and we're  

Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard not too soft
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard not too soft

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard not too soft
Verse 1:
I don't wanna hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart a pounding in my brain
It's driving me crazy we don't need to talk about it anymore

Chorus:
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby

Verse 2:
Don't say goodnight say you're gonna stay forever
All I want is you I'm never gonna let you go
Gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times I hurt you so

Chorus:
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby

Bridge:
Don't say goodbye say you're gonna stay forever
All I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through

Verse 3:
As the feeling inside keeps building
I'll find a way to you if it kills me if it kills me
If it kills me if it kills me

Chorus:
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby

Outro:
Don't say goodbye say you're gonna stay forever
Forever oh oh
All I wanna do is love you
I just wanna love you baby
Can't you see I'm in love with you baby
Verse 1:
Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby look what we've become

Chorus:
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

Verse 2:
I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby I don't wanna cry

Chorus:
Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone

Bridge:
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

Chorus:
All the memories and feelings still remain
I don't wanna feel this pain
I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be

Tryin' to walk away
But I stumble
Though I try to hide it
It's clear
My world crumbles
When you are not near


Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near


I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem all right and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front
Just a front hey


Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near


Here's my confession
May I be your possession
Boy I need your touch
Your love kisses and such
With all my might I try
But this I can't deny deny


Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near


Goodbye and I choke I don't wanna go
I try to walk away and I stumble I don't wanna go
Though I try to hide it it's clear clear
My world crumbles when you are not near I don't wanna go
Goodbye and I choke I don't wanna go
I try to walk away and I stumble I don't wanna go
Though I try to hide it it's clear clear
My world crumbles when you are not near I don't wanna go

I wanna make you feel just how I feel

Why be afraid if I'm not alone
Though life is never easy the rest is unknown
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone
Spent each and every moment
Searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark I finally see the light now
It's shining on me
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

Starting again is part of the plan
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step I'll make it through I know I can
It may not make it easier but I have felt you near all the way

Forever and ever I stand on the rock
Love is all it takes no matter what we face

Coming out of the dark I finally see the light now
It's shining on me
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

Looking back I see a part of me
That was always there but hard to see
Going on even when I doubted
Following you through the darkness

Coming out of the dark I finally see the light now
It's shining on me
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

But you got a magic boy that I just can't explain
Well you got a you got a way that you make me feel

Verse 1:
I'm tired of you telling me what to do
I'm tired of you telling me what to wear
I'm tired of you telling me what to say
I'm tired of you telling me every little thing

Chorus:
This house is not a home to me
This house is not the place I wanna be
This house is not a home to me
I'm better off living on the street

I'm tired of you treating me like a child
I'm tired of you acting like everything's fine
I'm tired of you lying to yourself
I'm tired of you treating me like nothing else

This house is not a home to me
This house is not the place I wanna be
This house is not a home to me
I'm better off living on the street

When I know that you're just not there
I'm tired of living in this fear

This house is not a home to me
I'm better off living on the street

Verse 1:
That's just the way it goes      
We live and learn and crash and burn      
And finding out was worth it      
Every moment spent on you   

I don't know where to draw the line        
I only know I'm here tonight oh oh         
And the best thing is to surrender     
To the rush that feels so right        

Chorus:        
Impulsive compulsive     
Without a reason what we are        
Impulsive compulsive         
We could do anything we want to do        

Verse 2:      
I'm feeling kind of lonely      
Can't understand the words you say         
Oh I wish that I could read you     
And maybe I'd find a way          

We're getting closer and closer      
When I close my eyes I feel the heart you hide         
You build a world around you      
It's not hard to see that you're safe inside      

Chorus        

Bridge:        
Surrender surrender to the fantasy 
Oh this moment moment in ecstasy        
Take me take me with you to the edge of ecstasy           
Take it in take it in          

Chorus          

Outro:            
Impulsive compulsive        
We could do anything     
oh we could go anywhere        
We could do anything we want to do
There's only one thing you need to know
I can't sleep at night I toss and turn
Listenin' for the telephone
But when I get your call I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
As a matter of fact it blows my mind
You would even talk to me because
A girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy
No matter what your friends try to tell ya
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together any kind of weather
It's like that it's like that
Every little step we take we'll be together
Every little step we make we'll be together
Can't stop this thing we started
You gotta know it's right
We got something that they can't take away
We'll never let 'em say
Hey you know it's true
Everything I do I do it for you

Ay yo but you need to come back to the essence of it all
So I can get that old thing back L


I need an around the way girl
That's the one for me
I need an around the way girl
To be my sunshine on a cloudy day
Where my girls at



Some of them try to act fly then justify
The reason why they're chosen to switch
Or I'm a bastard and I'm living too fast
And maybe slow down just a little bit
You're losin' it and everybody knows
Including your main squeeze but you're jealous of her success so
You guess that unless you become a doormat
You best be stepin' else you'll be lonely
There you stand with a frown
And your heart breakin' down
It's like that y'all
Dedicated to the one I love



I need an around the way girl
That's the one for me
I need an around the way girl
To be my sunshine on a cloudy day
Where my girls at



I wake up put a dip in my mouth
And put on my Adidas and step out
And kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through
Two in the morning and the party's still jumpin'
Cause my momma ain't home
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But but what we don't love them ho's
So we gonna smoke an ounce to this
G's up hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Rolled down my window grabbed my 9
Rated R this is a warning yo
Shook my head and said "Mmm 'cause they don't know thee"
And said "Yeah" throughout the ghetto


I need an around the way girl
That's the one for me
I need an around the way girl
To be my sunshine on a cloudy day
Where my girls at



LL Aman
Ay yo man let's get outta here
Word to mother what you say
Ay man let's go get something to eat man
I'm starving man what you wanna get

That show how much you really care
Like when I'm all alone with you
You know exactly what to do
You put that fire inside of me
And make it more than just a dream

Hook: Heavy D
One two tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot
To hit the jackpot rev me up rev me up
My little buttercup

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "I'm Not in Love" by Will to Power:

I'm not in love so don't forget it  
It's just a silly phase I'm going through  
And just because I call you up  
Don't get me wrong don't think you've got it made

Verse 1:
I guess it was real in my mind
Now you're here and you're alive
And you're in love with everything
I've always wanted to believe

Chorus:
But I can't believe it's true
When everything that I do
Doesn't seem to matter much to you
I saw the real I really did
I don't believe in you no more
I don't believe in you

Verse 2:
I guess it was real on TV
Now we're here and we're so happy
And I don't mind if I'm unfair
'Cause I know that you don't care

Chorus:
But I can't believe it's true
When everything that I do
Doesn't seem to matter much to you
I saw the real I really did
I don't believe in you no more
I don't believe in you

Bridge:
Nothing is real nothing is pure
Love cannot cure the things love has made
Nothing is clear nothing is bright
Love cannot always make things right

Chorus:
But I can't believe it's true
When everything that I do
Doesn't seem to matter much to you
I saw the real I really did
I don't believe in you no more
I don't believe in you

Additional lines in bridge:
La da da dee
La da da da
These lines are also repeated throughout the song
All This Time by Sting:

The polished town gives up its coattails  
The bourgeois revel in their retirement  
Gilded in gold these righteous folk  
Pay a pound of flesh to buy their way into heaven

All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea
If I had my way take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed with vision cursed with sight  
To see the works of men and to know what's right  
A beach of bones on a shoreline picked clean  
A man of straw with a heart that's seen  

All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea
If I had my way take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Forty years forsaken shell  
Scarred by the years no tale to tell  
Sold my soul for the second time  
'Cause the man don't pay me  
But the cheque still lies in the mail

All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea
If I had my way take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

All this time the river flowed incessantly  
It's hard to say it's hard to say  
It's hard to say just what I mean  
All this time the river flowed  
Father if you see me  
Pray for us at the end of time
Sure as an AI language model I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "More Than Words" by Extreme:

Saying "I love you"
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you not to say
But if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words is all you have to do
To make it real then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me 'cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real

What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying "I love you"

More than words
Hmm

Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do What would you do
If my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real

What would you say What would you say
If I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying "I love you"

More than words Oohh
More than wordsYes you do

More than words Oohh
Right here right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here right now
Watching the world wake up from history
I saw the decade in when it seemed
The world could change at the blink of an eye
And if anything then there's your sign
Of the times
I was alive and I waited waited
I was alive and I waited for this
Right here right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here right now
Watching the world wake up from history
I saw the decade in when it seemed
We'd take the world on at the blink of an eye
And if anything then there's your sign
Of the times
I was alive and I waited waited
I was alive and I waited for this
Right here right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here right now
Watching the world wake up from history


I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all
She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
Oh she's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling her private tune

And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine my magic friend

She says: hello you fool I love you
C'mon join the joyride join the joyride
She says: hello you fool I love you
C'mon join the joyride be a joyrider

I take you on a skyride
A feeling like you're spellbound
The sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby
She says: hello you fool I love you
C'mon join the joyride join the joyride
She says: hello you fool I love you
C'mon join the joyride be a joyrider

Aboard the spaceship two by two
Meet the others at the zigzag-zig
Jump on the tigers back
And feel the power oh yeah
I'm speeding on the freeways
Skyscraper's looking back at me
Hey hey hey you're feeling like a number
On a Jeopardy street hot fever

For sure it's like a French kiss
But you're tasting like a vanilla dream
You're saying: "go go go go"
I'm gonna take you to the top
Never stop

She says: hello you fool I love you
C'mon join the joyride join the joyride
She says: hello you fool I love you
C'mon join the joyride be a joyrider

Join the joyride
Follow the Moskva  
Down to Gorky Park  
Listening to the wind of change  
An August summer night  
Soldiers passing by  
Listening to the wind of change  
The world is closing in  
Did you ever think  
That we could be so close like brothers  
The future's in the air  
I can feel it everywhere  
Blowing with the wind of change  

Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow dream away  
In the wind of change  

Walking down the street  
Distant memories  
Are buried in the past forever  
I follow the Moskva  
Down to Gorky Park  
Listening to the wind of change  

The world is closing in  
Did you ever think  
That we could be so close like brothers  
The future's in the air  
I can feel it everywhere  
Blowing with the wind of change  

Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams  
With you and me  

Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow dream away  
In the wind of change  

The wind of change  
Blows straight into the face of time  
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell  
For peace of mind  
Let your balalaika sing  
What my guitar wants to say  

Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams  
With you and me  

Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow dream away  
In the wind of change  

The wind of change  
Blows straight into the face of time  
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell  
For peace of mind  
Let your balalaika sing  
What my guitar wants to say  

Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams  
With you and me  

Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow dream away  
In the wind of change

For peace of mind  
Let your balalaika sing  
What my guitar wants to say  

Let your balalaika sing  
What my guitar wants to say
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "After the Rain" by Nelson:

Lookin' out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say why why Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why why does he do me that way
I like livin' this way I like lovin' this way
That's why I'm happy happy most of the time

Lookin' out across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say why why Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why why does he do me that way
I like lovin' this way I like lovin' this way
That's why I'm happy happy most of the time

This world is forcing me to hold your hand
'Cause I'm just a slave to the rhythm
The beat and the way that you move me
You know I'm crazy but it feels alright
Anything for you anything for you
If they say why why Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why why does he do me that way
I like livin' this way I like lovin' this way
That's why I'm happy happy most of the time

Why why That's why I'm happy happy most of the time
I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Cry for Help" by Rick Astley as per your request:

She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves I'm not so sure
It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes I feel to blame

Why won't she say she needs me
I know she's not as strong as she seems

Why don't I feel her sigh
And why don't I hear her cry for help
Why don't I feel her sigh
And why don't I hear her cry for help

I wandered around the streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all
The rain on my face it covers the trace
Of all the tears I had to waste

Why must we hide emotions
Why must we never break down and cry

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help
No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help

Cry for help
No need to be afraid cry
Cry for help
It's not a sign of weakness
It's a sign of strength to come undone
So don't be ashamed to cry for help
Cry for help
Cry for help
Cry for help
Cry for help
Sometimes I think of Abraham
How one star he saw had been lit for me
He was a stranger in this land
And I am that no less than he
And on this road to righteousness
Sometimes the climb can be so steep
I may falter in my steps
But never beyond Your reach

Oh God You are my God
And I will ever praise You
Oh God You are my God
And I will ever praise You

I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step You lead me
And I will follow You all of my days

Sometimes I think of Abraham
How one star he saw had been lit for me
He was a stranger in this land
And I am that no less than he

And on this road to righteousness
Sometimes the climb can be so steep
I may falter in my steps
But never beyond Your reach

Oh God You are my God
And I will ever praise You
Oh God You are my God
And I will ever praise You

I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step You lead me
And I will follow You all of my days

And I will follow You all of my days
You can reach me by railway  
You can reach me by trailway  
You can reach me on an airplane  
You can reach me with your mind  
You can reach me by caravan  
Cross the desert like an Arab man  
I don't care how you get here  
Just get here if you can  

You can reach me by sailboat  
Climb a tree and swing rope-to-rope  
Take a sled and slide down the slope  
Into these arms of mine  
You can jump on a speedy colt  
Cross the border in a blaze of hope  
I don't care how you get here  
Just get here if you can  

There are hills and mountains between us  
Always something to get over  
If I had my way surely you would be closer  
I need you closer  

You can windsurf into my life  
Take me up on a carpet ride  
You can make it in a big balloon  
But you better make it soon  
You can reach me by caravan  
Cross the desert like an Arab man  
I don't care how you get here  
Just get here if you can  
I don't care how you get here  
Just get here if you  
Can

Chorus:
Here we go here we go here we go

Let your body groove
Just keep on dancin' dancin' dancin' dancin'
Just keep on dancin' dancin' dancin' dancin'
From the rockin' of the cradle
To the rollin' of the hearse
The goin' up was worth the comin' down
And all the good times were the worst

We danced beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Verse 1:
So you say that you can't go on
Love's run out of time
It's not that I don't understand
But I don't believe you're mine

Chorus:
Let me love you when your heart is tired
We can find love when we're blind
No one knows when their time is up
But time love and tenderless will keep us alive

Verse 2:
Girl we can't survive on memories
And wishes left behind
I'm no Superman I'm no hero
There's no reason to hide

Chorus

Bridge:
Sometimes I just don't know
How to handle what I feel
I'm caught between what you want
And knowing what is real

And we came here just to let you see
All we wanna do baby is real
Gotta keep this party going all night
So we came here to do it right
We'll make you move until you're bright
And the rhythm's caught up in your soul

Call me call me by my name or call me by number

And yet you try to make me forget
Who I really am don't tell me I'm not the one
'Cause oh I am the one the one and only

Chorus:
Nobody I'd rather be

Nobody I'd rather be

Verse 1:
Late night finds me in my bed
Cool sheets pulled over my head
Thinking 'bout the things you said
How you spun my heart around
Then you left me on the ground

Chorus:
PASSION
Burning deep down in my soul
PASSION
Can't seem to let you go
PASSION
Got me where you want me baby
PASSION
Driving me crazy

Verse 2:
Woke up to a cold grey dawn
Empty space where you belonged
Tried to tell myself it's wrong
I don't need you in my life
But I'm a fool to even try

Chorus:
PASSION
Burning deep down in my soul
PASSION
Can't seem to let you go
PASSION
Got me where you want me baby

Can't keep playing this game of condition
I need you like a flower needs rain
You got me caught up in the flame

And the signs said "Long-haired freaky people need not apply"
So I tucked my hair up under my hat and I went in to ask him why
He said "You look like a fine upstanding young man I think you'll do"
So I took off my hat I said "Imagine that Huh me workin' for you"
Whoa-oh-oh

Signs signs everywhere there's signs
Blockin' up the scenery breakin' my mind
Do this don't do that can't you read the sign

And the sign said anybody caught trespassin' would be shot on sight
So I jumped on the fence and-a yelled at the house "Hey What gives you the right"
"To put up a fence to keep me out or to keep mother nature in"
"If God was here he'd tell you to your face man you're some kinda sinner"

Signs signs everywhere there's signs
Blockin' up the scenery breakin' my mind
Do this don't do that can't you read the sign

Now hey you mister can't you read
You've got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat
You can't even watch no you can't eat you ain't supposed to be here
The sign said you got to have a membership card to get inside uh

And the sign said "Everybody welcome Come in kneel down and pray"
But when they're movin' brother they'll take you where you can't feel
Signs signs everywhere there's signs
Blockin' up the scenery breakin' my mind
Do this don't do that can't you read the sign

Signs signs everywhere there's signs
Signs signs everywhere there's signs
Signs signs everywhere there's signs
Signs signs everywhere there's signs
Do this don't do that can't you read the sign
I'll do my best to provide the lyrics without any censorship or commentary:

It's been a long time since you left me
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to disappoint you no
I didn't mean to tell you lies

And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why
One more try I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

I remember all the good times
Someone said that love was blind
But sometimes I just don't understand
Why you left this heart of mine

And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why
One more try I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

One more try I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

Give it one more try baby one more time
Baby let me show you that I'm the one
I can make it right I can love you more
Than any other guy

One more try I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

One more try I need you by my side
One more try let me be the one you guide
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

Yo it's about that time
To break forth the rhythm and the rhyme
I'm a get mine so get yours
I wanna see sweat comin' out your pores
On the house tip of the sound
Swinging this strictly hip hop well round
I'm a trip to the tip top what a bop
I'm a giveaway a bit a rock I'm a drip drop
Rockin' rhythms speaking powerful
Music's for us to power at the hour

I'll do my best to provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Love of a Lifetime" by FireHouse:

I guess the time was right for us to say
We'd take our time and live our lives together yeah
We knew it all along and without a doubt
We were all in so we both said

We would never ever change our minds
About the love that we have found

And oh yeah love was here and now
And here we are with the love of a lifetime

You know that we'll never ever change our minds
About the love that we have found

And oh yeah love was here and now
And here we are with the love of a lifetime

Oh oh

All those times I've been alone
And didn't know what to do yeah yeah
I always found myself dreaming
Of a girl like you who's always

Thinking of me and we both know that we're in love
And here we are with the love of a lifetime

You know that we'll never ever change our minds
About the love that we have found

And oh yeah love was here and now
And here we are with the love of a lifetime

Yeah yeah

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh how quickly life can turn around in an instant
It feels so good to know where we're standin'
I'll never let you go 'cause I really know

You're the one for me oh yes you are
And you'll always be the love of my life

Yeah yeah

We'll never ever change our minds
About the love

Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  

I am sitting in the morning  
At the diner on the corner  
I am waiting at the counter  
For the man to pour the coffee  
And he fills it only halfway  
And before I even argue  
He is looking out the window  
At somebody coming in  

"It is always nice to see you"  
Says the man behind the counter  
To the woman who has come in  
She is shaking her umbrella  
And I look the other way  
As they are kissing their hellos  
And I'm pretending not to see them  
And instead I pour the milk  

I open up the paper  
There's a story of an actor  
Who had died while he was drinking  
It was no one I had heard of  
And I'm turning to the horoscope  
And looking for the funnies  
When I'm feeling someone watching me  
And so I raise my head  

There's a woman on the outside  
Looking inside does she see me  
No she does not really see me  
Cause she sees her own reflection  
And I'm trying not to notice  
That she's hitching up her skirt  
And while she's  
Straightening her stockings  
Her hair has gotten wet  

Oh this rain it will continue  
Through the morning as I'm listening  
To the bells of the cathedral  
I am thinking of your voice  

Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo  

And of the midnight picnic  
Once upon a time  
Before the rain began  

I finish up my coffee  
It's time to catch the train
