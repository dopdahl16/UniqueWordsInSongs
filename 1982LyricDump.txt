Rising up back on the street
Did my time took my chances
Went the distance now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all in the eye of the tiger

Face to face out in the heat
Hangin' tough stayin' hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For we kill with the skill to survive

It's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all in the eye of the tiger

Rising up straight to the top
Had the guts got the glory
Went the distance now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all in the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he must a been about seventeen

Till he was with me yeah me singin'

Where we can be alone

Next we were movin' on

Does she walk Does she talk  
Does she come complete  
My homeroom homeroom angel  
Always pulled me from my seat  
She was pure like snowflakes  
No one could ever stain  
The memory of my angel  
Could never cause me pain  
Years go by I'm looking through a girlie magazine  
And there's my homeroom angel  
On the pages in-between  

My blood runs cold my memory has just been sold  
My angel is the centerfold  
Angel is the centerfold  
My memory has just been sold  
My angel is the centerfold  

Slipped me notes under the desk  
While I was thinking about her dress  
I was shy I turned away  
Before she caught my eye  
I was shakin' in my shoes  
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues  
Something had a hold on me  
When angel passed close by  

Those soft fuzzy sweaters  
Too magical to touch  
Too see her in that negligee  
Is really just too much  
Mm Mm Mm Mm  

My blood runs cold my memory has just been sold  
My angel is the centerfold  
Angel is the centerfold

Take your car Yes we will  
We'll go for a ride  
Take you car We'll take mine  
We'll get some food and stay all night  
You got to

I know that you're an angel  
I know that you're a teaser  
But you're wild  
Wired and wonderful  
Oh Listen to me

You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out I shook you up
And turned you around
Turned you into someone new

Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't don't you want me
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't don't you want me
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Don't don't you want me
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't don't you want me
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh

Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh
Don't you want me baby
Don't you want me oh
A little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jackie gonna be a football star
Diane debutante backseat of Jackie's car

Suckin' on chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jackie's lap
He's got his hand between her knees
Jackie say "Hey Diane let's run off
Behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks
Let me do what I please"

Say a little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids doin' the best they can

Jackie say "Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone"

Oh yeah they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

So let it rock let it roll
Let the bible belt come and save my soul
Hold on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men

Little ditty 'bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Life goes on long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
When I was a young boy

Said put away those young boy ways

Now that I'm gettin' older

So much older

I love all those young boy days

With a girl like you

With a girl like you

Lord knows there are things we can do baby

Just me and you

Come on and make it

Hurt so good

Come on baby make it hurt so good

Sometimes love don't feel like it should

You make it hurt so good

You don't have to be so exciting

Just tryin' to give myself a little bit of fun yeah

You always look so invitin'

You ain't as green as you are young

Hey baby it's you

Come on girl now it's you

Sink your teeth right through my bones baby

Let's see what we can do

Come on and make it

Hurt so good

Come on baby make it hurt so good

Sometimes love don't feel like it should

You make it hurt so good

I ain't talkin' no big deals

I ain't made no plans myself

I ain't talkin' no high heels

Maybe we could walk around all day long

Walk around all day long

Come on and make it

Hurt so good

Come on baby make it hurt so good

Sometimes love don't feel like it should

You make it hurt so good

I don't need no disguise

I don't need no disguise

I don't need no disguise
Sometimes I feel I've got to ha
Run away I've got to ha
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Chorus:
Once I ran to you I ran
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love oh
Tainted love

Now I know I've got to ha
Run away I've got to ha
Get away you don't really want any more from me
To make things right you need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Chorus x2
All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes  
Rosanna Rosanna  
Never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me  
Rosanna  
All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight  
Rosanna Rosanna  
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be  
Not quite a year since she went away  
Rosanna yeah  

Now she's gone and I have to say  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  

I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side  
Rosanna Rosanna  
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad  
Rosanna  

All I wanna tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise  
Rosanna Rosanna  
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad  
Not quite a year since she went away  
Rosanna yeah  

Now she's gone and I have to say  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  

Not quite a year since she went away  
Rosanna yeah  

Now she's gone and I have to say  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way  

Meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna  
Meet you all the way meet you all the way Rosanna

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "867-5309/Jenny" by Tommy Tutone:

Jenny Jenny who can I turn to
You give me somethin' I can hold on to

867-5309 867-5309 867-5309 867-5309

867-5309 fade out
Wrapped around each other
Trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together
Lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies
Falling in love so desperately
Honey I was your hero
And you were my leading lady

We had it all just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late late show
Sailing away to Key Largo

Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again I know
Just like they did in Key Largo

Honey can't you remember
We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender
When you gave me your heart
Please say you will play it
Again 'cause I love you
Just like they did in Key Largo

We had it all just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late late show
Sailing away to Key Largo

Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again I know
Just like they did in Key Largo

We had it all just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late late show
Sailing away to Key Largo

Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again I know
Just like they did in Key Largo
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "You Should Hear How She Talks About You" by Melissa Manchester:

She's getting up there and she's got her own place
I'm kinda nervous but it sure feels great
I finally feel like I'm holding the reins
My life's so different from a year ago today

Now she's telling me she wants me to meet her tonight
I can feel it my heart is beating so fast
I think she's gonna take me and love me tonight
It feels so right it feels so good

You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she says
She thinks you're something special
She thinks you're okay
She thinks you're something special
She thinks you're okay

Sometimes at night when I'm alone and blue
I can hear her voice she's talking to you
She says she loves me but you're the one
She'd be willing to die for you 
So when you go and steal her away
I'll be left here all alone
I'll just have to find another someone to fall in love with
Again

You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she says
She thinks you're something special
She thinks you're okay
She thinks you're something special
She thinks you're okay

I'm just waiting for the day to come
When you'll break her heart and she'll come back to me
Then I'll be here and I'll be waiting for her with open arms
And I'll be saying

You should hear how she talks about me
You should hear what she says
She thinks I'm something special
She thinks I'm okay
She thinks I'm something special
She thinks I'm okay

She thinks I'm something special
She thinks I'm okay
Verse 1:
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul

Chorus:
Don't go to Heaven 'cause it's really only Hell
Don't smell the flowers they're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women 'cause they'll only bring you down
Hey you can't trust them
'Cause they'll only bring you down

Verse 2:
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down

Chorus:
Don't go to Heaven 'cause it's really only Hell
Don't smell the flowers they're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women 'cause they'll only bring you down

'Cause they'll only bring you down

Bridge:
Run run run away
Oh it's such a cold cold world
Don't don't run run away away
Oh no they they said said you'll only only stay stay

Verse 3:
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to turn you on
Don't think of tomorrow
'Cause you'll be gone by then
Don't give up your education
'Cause you can't go back if you blow the chance you get

Chorus:
Don't go to Heaven 'cause it's really only Hell
Don't smell the flowers they're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women 'cause they'll only bring you down
Hey you can't trust them
'Cause they'll only bring you down

Outro:
Don't talk to strangers
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second-best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second-best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Verse 1:
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine yes it was
Till she blew my mind
Oh shit
The other woman gotcha again
Verse 2:
She's the devil in disguise
You can see it in her eyes
She's telling dirty lies
She's the other woman it's a fact
Verse 3:
She's a heartless machine
She's the next woman of my dreams
And she's driving me to extremes
She's the other woman gets me every time
Verse 4:
And I don't wanna lose this feeling
And I don't wanna hide this feeling
Why should I be ashamed of this feeling
I'm in love with another woman you know the drill
Verse 1:
Love you know I've been looking for a new direction
Searching for someone who's not afraid of love and affection
I've been looking for someone I can give my all
Cause when I'm loving someone I don't want to be small

Chorus:
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around

Verse 2:
Love I know we can make it if we just stay together
And keep the faith in one another oh yeah
Our love will keep us side by side
Together we will turn the tide

We talked the longest hours
We fear without alarms
The wind of love
We wrap around our arms

We face the darkest nights
We embrace the brightest lights
The truth of love
We whisper in the night

Chorus:
Only the lonely knows me oh yeah
Only the lonely knows me

Outro:
We love the deepest love
We're one without the above
The magic of love
We stand high above

Who can it be knocking at my door
Go away don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night
I'm very tired and I'm not feeling right
All I wish is to be alone
Stay away don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in I'll only run and hide


Who can it be now
Who can it be now
Who can it be now
Who can it be now


Who can it be knocking at my door
Make no sound tip-toe across the floor
If he hears he'll knock all day
I'll be trapped and here I'll have to stay
I've done no harm I keep to myself
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
I like it here with my childhood friend
Here they come those feelings again


Who can it be now
Who can it be now
Who can it be now
Who can it be now




Who can it be now
Who can it be now
Who can it be now
Who can it be now


Is it the man come to take me away
Why do they follow me It's not the future that I can see
It's just my fantasy
Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'
Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing
Chorus:
I am the eye in the sky looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore
To know that
I can read your mind looking at you
I can read your mind looking at you
I can read your mind looking at you
I can read your mind
Don't leave false illusion behind
Don't cry cause I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving
Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
open arms

Living without you living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
open arms

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me

Open arms open arms
Yeah hey
Open arms open arms
The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just the living legacy to the leader of the band

My brothers' lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chosen and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa I don't think I said 'I love you' near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just the living legacy to the leader of the band
I am the living legacy to the leader of the band
Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile I try not to be
I search only for something I can't see

I have my own life and I am stronger
Than you know
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

Lovers forever face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

You in the moonlight with your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right when I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave

Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry

But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

Lovers forever face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

Lovers forever face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

Lovers forever face to face
My city or mountains
Stay with me stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Even the Nights Are Better" by Air Supply:

I I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong
Why love had gone
And left me lonely

I I was so confused
Feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me
And my loneliness left me

I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak but now that I've found you


Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you oh

You you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain

And you did more
Than mend a broken heart
Cause now you've made a fire start
And I I can see that you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me then came you



Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you oh

Love is a splendid thing
We should all be thankful fora thing
When love is gone
We'll need something to believe in



Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside ya
Even the nights are better
Since I found you oh
Hey lady you lady cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother and a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me like I wanna talk to you

Oh I've been to Georgia and California oh anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me

Please lady please lady don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies

Oh I've been to Niece and the isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne on a yacht
I've moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't s'pose to see
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me

Hey you know what paradise is It's a lie a fantasy we create about people and places as we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is It's that little baby you're holding and it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children that might have made me complete
But I I took the sweet life I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that cost too much to be free
Hey lady I've been to paradise but I've never been to me

I've been to paradise never been to me
I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run never been to me
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me
I've been to crying for unborn children that might have made me complete never been to me
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me repeat and fade
Yeah seein' you and him and him and you

Makes me wonder why we ever broke apart

Laying here alone I'm tryin' to find
A way to make it start

I remember every look upon your face

The way you roll your eyes the way you taste

You make it hard for me to keep my cool

If you don't know what we could find
Why don't we go
Chorus:
So let's roll baby roll
Let's lose control baby let's lose control
Let's go '65 love affair ain't it good
Baby let's go let's go all the way
It could be just like it was only even better
Let's go '65 love affair ain't it good ain't it right
Don't you miss the feeling music used to bring
He's got someone else you're not sure of anything
Broken hearts and broken dreams are not the
End of everything
But if you don't know what we could find
Why don't we go
Chorus
So why don't we go let's not worry about a thing
Take what we got and let's go all the way
Chorus
Verse 1:
Well I'm an eight-ball-shooting double-fisted-drinking son of a gun
I wear my jeans a little tight just to watch the little boys come undone
I'm here for the beer and the ball-busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can

Chorus:
You know I'm here to party so let's get it on
Got my hand on my money and my money on my mind
Where's all the good looking women with the bodies and the whips
I got a kiss for you honey but stick out your lip we'll make it real

Verse 2:
I smoke a little home-grown from the countryside
So lay back and let me paint you a picture of the way things are the way things could be
Somewhere somebody's doing it you know what I mean
We'll find a honky-tonk where the drinks are cold and cheap

Chorus:
You know I'm here to party so let's get it on
Got my hand on my money and my money on my mind
Where's all the good looking women with the bodies and the whips
I got a kiss for you honey but stick out your lip we'll make it real

Bridge:
I'm an eight-ball-shooting double-fisted-drinking son of a gun
I wear my jeans a little tight and I'm always on the run
I'm here for the beer and the ball-busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can

Chorus:
You know I'm here to party so let's get it on
Got my hand on my money and my money on my mind
Where's all the good looking women with the bodies and the whips

Outro:

Verse 1:
She wants to be loved
All night long
For all her life
But I don't want to tag along
Could it be that I'm afraid
That kind of loving just don't last
So in the haze of temptation
I look straight ahead and don't look back

Chorus:
That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart

Verse 2:
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free
And then I'll be her man
But that's not the way it's gonna be
So I keep on taking the medicine
Thinking that this will cure
But it takes more than a doctor
To prescribe a remedy for pure

Chorus:
That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart

Bridge:
Oh if I danced with other dolls
I'd be caught in a trap
You better not talk about love
Or she'll whip you with her strap

Chorus:
That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart

Outro:
That girl that girl that girl
That girl thinks she got it going on over me
That girl that girl that girl
That girl thinks she got it going on over me
Verse 1:
I like to have a good time 
I never did no harm
I never felt so good 
with anybody else 
Never had nothing quite like this 
Don't wanna disrespect
But they're telling me
You're a heartbreaker

Chorus:
Love's been a little bit hard on me 
If you know what I mean 
Love's been a little bit hard on me 
But when I'm with you 
I feel like a queen

Verse 2:
Honey I'm a child
But you're in my heart
Wanna take you home 
And won't let you go
Never had nothing quite like this
Don't wanna disrespect
But they're telling me
You're a heartbreaker

Chorus:
Love's been a little bit hard on me 
If you know what I mean 
Love's been a little bit hard on me 
But when I'm with you 
I feel like a queen

Bridge:
I'm trying to keep it to myself
But I just can't help it 
Got me acting like a crazy lady 
Tryin' to keep from screaming 
Love's been a little bit hard on me 
But when I'm with you 
I feel like a queen

Chorus:
Love's been a little bit hard on me 
If you know what I mean 
Love's been a little bit hard on me 
But when I'm with you 
I feel like a queen

Outro:
Love's been a little bit 
Love's been a little bit 
Love's been a little bit 
Love's been a little bit hard on me
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Young Turks" by Rod Stewart:

Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket
And a head full of dreams
He said somehow some way
It's gotta get better than this
Patti packed her bags left a note for her momma
She was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night
They were so excited
We got just one shot of life
Gonna take it while we're still not afraid
Because life is so brief and time is a thief
When you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand it can slip right through your hands

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let them put you down don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

Paradise was closed so they headed for the coast
In a blissful manner
They took a two room apartment
That was jumping every night of the week
Happiness was found in each other's arms
As expected yeah baby
Billy pierced his ears drove a pickup like a lunatic oh
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on on your on your side
Billy wrote a letter back home to Patty's parents
Try to explain
He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way
But there ain't no point in talking when there's nobody listening
So we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a ten pound baby boy yeah
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time in on your side
Young hearts gotta run free
Be free live free
Time is on time is on your side
Time time time time is on your side
Is on your side
It's on your side
It's on your side
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Freeze-Frame" by The J Geils Band:

Freeze-frame freeze-frame freeze-frame
Freeze-frame freeze-frame freeze-frame

Now I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday
Zoom lens feeling just won't do
Close-up darkroom sweet-talkin' twilight
It's been so long since I've seen you

Almost forgot the way you move
Did I ever tell you you play the blues
In those smokey places where we met
Well you're a junkyard angel and you ain't even pretty

So I buy you a beer you say "thank you dear
You don't really wanna take me home"
That's a rumor that's goin' 'round 'round 'round
Ya better turn me loose turn me loose ya know that I'm not for you
Ya better turn me loose turn me loose ya know that I'm not for you
Ya better turn me loose

Well you're the devil's yes you are
You're the devil's yes you are
Well you're the devil's shining light

You wanna take me hostage with the things you do
You drive me to a frenzy with your "Boo Boo Baby" too
Now what do you want to do break my heart again
Another lesson learned better listen to what I say girl

Ya better turn me loose turn me loose
Ya know that I'm not for you
Ya better turn me loose turn me loose
Ya know that I'm not for you
Ya better turn me loose turn me loose

Freeze-frame freeze-frame freeze-frame
Freeze-frame freeze-frame freeze-frame
Walking in the cold just remember that it's always warm somewhere
And I'm carrying the message loud and clear
It's delivered every time I see a need
People together building dreams around a common theme

Keep the fire burnin' let it keep us warm
The world will keep on turnin' let it turn you on
Let us not stop learnin' we can help one another be strong
Let us never lose our yearnin' to keep the fire burnin' yearnin'

And somewhere in the night waiting for me
Someone's wanting to break free
She'll be looking for the answers that I'll never know
She'll be listening to the music that I'll never know

Keep the fire burnin' let it keep us warm
The world will keep on turnin' let it turn you on
Let us not stop learnin' we can help one another be strong
Let us never lose our yearnin' to keep the fire burnin' yearnin'

Keep the fire burnin' let it keep us warm
The world will keep on turnin' let it turn you on
Let us not stop learnin' we can help one another be strong
Let us never lose our yearnin' to keep the fire burnin' yearnin'

Keep the fire burnin' let it keep us warm
The world will keep on turnin' let it turn you on
Let us not stop learnin' we can help one another be strong
Let us never lose our yearnin' to keep the fire burnin' yearnin'
I'd be happy to provide the uncensored lyrics to "Caught Up In You" by 38 Special:

I never knew there'd come a day
When I'd be sayin' to you
Don't let this good love slip away
Now that we know that it's true
Don't you know the kind of man I am
No one else can love you like I can
You know I can you know I can

Chorus:
Caught up in you I'm caught up in you
Caught up in you and I've never been this close to love
Caught up in you I'm caught up in you
Caught up in you and I've never been this close to love

The stars are out and shining bright
And girl I'm feelin' kinda lonely tonight
If you'd been here you'd understand
I'm glad to have you take my hand
I want you to know I've been thinking of you
And all the things that we could do you know I can
You know I can

Chorus:
Caught up in you I'm caught up in you
Caught up in you and I've never been this close to love
Caught up in you I'm caught up in you
Caught up in you and I've never been this close to love

You know the kind of tearful looks
That can give a girl the shakes
You know the kind of workin' night
That can give this heart a break
What do you do when it's fallin' apart
And you knew it was gone from the very start
Caught up in you caught up in you
Caught up in you caught up in you

Chorus:
Caught up in you I'm caught up in you
Caught up in you and I've never been this close to love
Caught up in you I'm caught up in you
Caught up in you and I've never been this close to love

Caught up in you caught up in you
Caught up in you caught up in you
Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah
Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah why do fools fall in love
Why do birds sing so gay
Lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see
For that fool is me
Tell me why tell me why
Why do birds sing so gay
Lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Why does my heart skip a crazy beat
For I know it will reach defeat
Tell me why tell me why
Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah
Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah why do fools fall in love
Why do birds sing so gay
Lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Why does my heart skip a crazy beat
For I know it will reach defeat
Tell me why tell me why
Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah
Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah why do they fall in love
Look around me  
I can see my life before me  
Running rings around the way  
It used to be  
I am older now  
I have more than what I wanted  
But I wish that I had started  
Long before I did  
And there's so much time to make up  
Everywhere you turn  
Time we have wasted on the way  
So much water moving  
Underneath the bridge  
Let the water come and carry us away  
Oh when you were young  
Did you question all the answers  
Did you envy all the dancers  
Who had all the nerve  
Look 'round you now  
You must go for what you wanted  
Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved  
So much time to make up  
Everywhere you turn  
Time we have wasted on the way  
So much water moving  
Underneath the bridge  
Let the water come and carry us away  
Let the water come and carry us away  
Let the water come and carry us away  
Oh let the water come and carry us away
Ooh somethin's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin' burnin' like a lover on fire
Hold me tight baby
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
Yeah I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
I feel like a hero
And you are my heroine
Hold me tight baby
I don't wanna let you go
'Cause I need you need you tonight
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
Yeah I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
Yeah I'm thinkin' of her every day and night
I'm gettin' no sleep till I get it right
I gotta get a hold of that girl somehow
I think about her all the time
I'm feelin' good now and I'm dancin' in the street
Movin' to the rhythm of the midnight beat
I gotta live it up won't let nobody bring me down
It's gotta be fate
I found a lover on the edge of the knife
And she's makin' me crazy yeah
It's gotta be love
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
Yeah I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
I think I'm in love
Love's comin' on strong
And I don't want to wait too long
I've waited all my life for love to come
And now I'm standing here love has begun

Love is in control
Finger on my heart
Love is in control
Finger on my heart


Touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
With you I'm always strong and I never have to wait too long
For love to come and then in the night
Feeling your touch I can't deny
Love is in control
Finger on my heart



Come on and touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again



Love is in control 
If you take this advice  
You're gonna step up  
And strut your stuff  
You don't have to hide away  
Afraid to love and show your face  
Let's start with tonight  
Little girl I wanna show you how to do it right  

You know that  
I can make it happen  
There ain't nothin' to it  
Any time you want me to  
I can give you one hundred ways  

Look into my eyes  
And I'll own you  
With them moves like princes  
I'll stone you  
There is nothing that could stop you  
From feeling the curves of my body 

You know that  
I can make it happen  
There ain't nothin' to it  
Any time you want me to  
I can give you one hundred ways  

It's getting late  
And it's time to make it right  
So why don't we just groove  
There just ain't no need  
To be afraid of this feeling  
And there ain't nothin' wrong  
With giving in to what you want  

You know that  
I can make it happen  
There ain't nothin' to it  
Any time you want me to  
I can give you one hundred ways  

Give me your love  
And I'll give you one hundred ways
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "You Could Have Been with Me" by Sheena Easton:

There's something I wanna say
To you only today
As I wipe away
A tear from my eye
A heart that's been true
But maybe too good to you
I gave my love
You gave nothing to me

I try to smile and hide
The way I feel inside
But my heart can't deny
The love that I feel
It's my first mistake
But it's a big one to make
Only history
Will know if I'm right


You could have been with me
Instead of alone and lonely
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You should have been beside me
You could have been with me
When the good times were rollin'
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
If you weren't so blind
You'd see that I'm the one
And you could have been with me

I've been searching for so long
For a love to fill my soul
And now I see everything
In a different light
You were my first love
And you'll be my last love
Please take me away
To some quiet place


You could have been with me
Instead of alone and lonely
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You should have been beside me
You could have been with me
When the good times were rollin'
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
If you weren't so blind
You'd see that I'm the one
And you could have been with me


You could have been with me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You could have been with me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Verse 1:
I never believed in things that I couldn't see
I said if I can't feel it then how can it be
No no magic could happen to me
And then I saw you

Chorus:
I couldn't believe it you took my heart
I couldn't retrieve it said to myself
What's it all about
Now I know there can be no doubt

You can do magic you can have anything that you desire
Magic and you know you're the one who can put out the fire
You know darn well when you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes a heart of stone can turn to clay

Verse 2:
I never believed in things that I couldn't see
I said if I can't feel it then how can it be
No magic could happen to me
And then I saw you

Chorus:
I couldn't believe it you took my heart
I couldn't retrieve it said to myself
What's it all about
Now I know there can be no doubt

You can do magic you can have anything that you desire
Magic and you know you're the one who can put out the fire
You know darn well when you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes a heart of stone can turn to clay

Bridge:
And I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I knew somebody like you
No I don't want to fall in love This line is only in some versions

Chorus:
You can do magic you can have anything that you desire
Magic and you know you're the one who can put out the fire
You know darn well when you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes a heart of stone can turn to clay

Outro:
You can do magic
You can do magic
You can do magic
You can do magic
Well she was standing by my dressing room after the show  
Asking for my autograph and asked if I would like to go   
Out on a date  
I said I'd like to with you  
But I'm just someone whose music goes through  
Changes and through phases  
And through girls   
Well they come and they go  
And they're just like songs  

But the feeling gets old  
After a while  
Like this rock and roll  
Out on the edge of style  

Somebody's baby  
Oh-whoa-o  
Somebody's out there somewhere  
Somebody's baby  
She's tough little lady  
But somebody's baby  
Tonight  
She's a blue-eyed runner in the lights  
And she's looking for a boy to give her his time  
He comes sneaking in  
When the show lets out  
When he knows that she won't be hanging around  
And he's watching her steps  
What she's leaving behind  
And she's just somebody's baby tonight  

Somebody's baby  
Oh-whoa-o  
Somebody's out there somewhere  
Somebody's baby  
She's a tough little lady  
But somebody's baby tonight  

I hear the drums echoing tonight  
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation  
She's coming in 12:30 flight  
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation  
I stopped an old man along the way  
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies  
He turned to me as if to say  
"Hurry boy it's waiting there for you"  

Somebody's baby  
Oh-whoa-o  
Somebody's out there somewhere  
Somebody's baby  
She's a tough little lady  
But somebody's baby  
Tonight
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Oh No" by Commodores:

Oh no here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on good things never last
Nothing's in the past it always seems to come again
Again and again
Again and again

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out protectors of the realm
Capatin's at the helm sail across the sea of lights
Circles and rings dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and spell
Blessed by the night holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell

Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows shining ever-bright

Daylight I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burned out ends of desperation
Memories linger on
Jaded hearts heal with time
Shootin' stars call us the time has come
Oh no oh no
Oh no oh no

Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows shining ever-bright

Don't you cry
Don't you die
Don't you burn with shame
When they call your name

Run rabbit run
Dig that hole forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one

For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
You can't go half-way
And you have to let it show
Love will turn you around turn you around
Well it won't take long no time
To turn your head around
Love will turn you around turn you around

Verse 1:
Out of the blue she comes to you
With a sweet love and devotion
You're lost in her and the world begins to move
And nothing's gonna change her love and emotion

Verse 2:
And when you're looking back someday

Love will turn you around
Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Gloria you're always on the run now
Running after somebody you gotta get him somehow
I think you've got to slow down before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown so be careful not to show it


You really don't remember was it something that he said
Are the voices in your head calling Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria how's it gonna go down
Will you meet him on the main line or will you catch him on the rebound
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria you don't have to answer
We're all staring at your every move we're all hoping that you'll improve
We're all hoping that you'll improve


Gloria they found you on the floor Gloria
The pain you gave us well it's never gonna go away Gloria
Just stop your crying it's a sign of the times Gloria
We gotta get away from here


We gotta get away from here G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria how's it gonna go down G-L-O-R-I-A
Will you meet him on the main line or will you catch him on the rebound G-L-O-R-I-A
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria you don't have to answer
We're all staring at your every move we're all hoping that you'll improve


All the voices in your head
Calling Gloria
Don't you think it's time you started living
All the voices in your head
Calling Gloria
Don't you think it's time you started living


Gloria how's it gonna go down G-L-O-R-I-A
Will you meet him on the main line or will you catch him on the rebound G-L-O-R-I-A
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria you don't have to answer
We're all staring at your every move we're all hoping that you'll improve
We're all hoping that you'll improve
We're all hoping that you'll improve
Yesterday's songs
Don't stay around long
Not much anymore

Yesterday's words
Don't make themselves heard
Like they did before

And people's lives
Pass like ships in the night
It's a place in the sun
When we were young

We need yesterday's songs
Like a lover's dependence
Yesterday's songs
Gotta have that love again

Yesterday's songs
Don't ever stay long
Nothing else to compare

Memories won't die
They only hide
Deep down inside

And people's lives
Pass like ships in the night
It's a place in the sun
When we were young

We need yesterday's songs
Like a lover's dependence
Yesterday's songs
Gotta have that love again

Yesterday's songs
Keep us hearin'
Keep us nearin'
Yesterday's songs

Yesterday's songs

Yesterday's songs
Gotta have that love again

Yesterday's songs
Yesterday's songs

Yesterday's songs
Gotta have that love again
Ah yes Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Crimson and Clover" by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts:


Ah now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover


Ah well if she come walkin' over
Now I been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover 
Over and over 


Yeah if my senses don't desert me
She could make me love her
Crimson and clover


Ah well if she come walkin' over
Now I been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover 
Over and over 


My mind's such a sweet sensation
People tell me that I'm wrong to wanna make her
Stay till the end of that song yeah 


Ah well if she come walkin' over
Now I been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover 
Over and over 


Crimson and clover over and over 
Crimson and clover over and over 
Crimson and clover over and over 
Crimson and clover over and over 
Crimson and clover over and over 
Crimson and clover over and over
Though I try before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me must I always be alone

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Here I Am" by Air Supply:

Here I am playing with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me
Holding you a feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside
So there's no sense pretending
My heart it's not mending

Here I am and you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left me
And there's a heartbeat and it echoes today
Throbbing through my body driving me wild

Here I am feeling like a stranger in this life
Looking for a way to get to you
All I need is just to hear you say:
"Hello" 'cause I can't resist you no more

So there's no sense pretending
My heart it's not mending

Here I am and you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left me
And there's a heartbeat and it echoes today
Throbbing through my body driving me wild

Here I am feeling like a stranger in this life
Looking for a way to get to you
All I need is just to hear you say:
"Hello" 'cause I can't resist you no more

Here I am and you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left me
Here I am and you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left me
Here I am still waiting for your love
Here I am still waiting for your love

The way you walked in that room
Cause the serious moonlight in you

So why was it so hard
To leave your old world

Makes it hard for me to keep my cool

So why was it so hard
To leave your old world

Wide as the sky oh my

There's nobody home and aint't it

Looking at the lyrics of "Kids in America" by Kim Wilde here they are uncensored:

Looking out of a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why

Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

Down town the young ones are going
Down town the young ones are growing

We're the kids in America whoa
We're the kids in America whoa
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Bright lights the music gets faster
Look boy don't check on your watch not another glance
I'm not leaving now honey not a chance

Hot-shot give me no problems
Much later baby you'll be saying never mind
You know life is cruel life is never kind

Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory

We're the kids in America whoa
We're the kids in America whoa
Everybody live for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la sing

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America

We're the kids in America whoa
We're the kids in America whoa
Everybody live for the music-go-round

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America

We're the kids in America whoa
We're the kids in America whoa
Everybody live for the music-go-round
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Man on Your Mind" by Little River Band:

Sometimes when you're talkin' I see you
Lost inside your mind
You're incommunicado boy you're just
Left behind
It's not the way you want it
But the way it's gonna be
So don't give in lightly
When you know you disagree


Got a man on your mind
Got a man on your mind
Got him bad bad bad
Got a man on your mind

I know what you're goin' through
It's like sittin' in a cell
But every time you think you're free
You just don't know how to yell
This ain't reality boy
You gotta live your own life
But you're listening to your mother
And you're scared to feel the knife


Got a man on your mind
Got a man on your mind
Got him bad bad bad
Got a man on your mind




Got a man on your mind
Got a man on your mind
Got him bad bad bad
Got a man on your mind


Got a man on your mind
Got a man on your mind
Watching girls go passing by
It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense
Out of these girls passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Don't need a whore don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
Hmmm yeah
Ooh-oo-hoo ooh-ooh-ooh
La-la-la-la la-la la-la
Hmmm mm-mm mm-mm
La-la-la-la la-la la-la

Girl do I do what you do when I do my love to you

When I'm holding you tight
If you feel it too

When I'm home alone
I think of you and only you yeah


Girl do I do what you do when I do my love to you

When I'm holding you tight
If you feel it too

I wish that I could love you twice
You know that when we're alone

Sure Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Goin' Down" by Greg Guidry:

Got your invitation to the dance
Wear your party dress
Maybe I was under your trance
But now I couldn't care less
If you gave me your love
I'd throw it back in your face
Got enough of my own
And it's in the right place

Chorus:
Goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down

Your daddy's a banker
And your mama's a belle
They give you everything boy
And you'll burn in hell
With your headlights on high
And your top let down
Get off the road
If you can't tame that hound

Chorus

You called to ask me
For another chance
I said it's too late
For a second dance
So find your new lover
And someone else's ass
Get on your horse
'Cause you're ridin' your last

Chorus x2
I'll do my best to provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Through the Years" by Kenny Rogers:

I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found I've found with you
Through the years I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I stayed right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted who I listened to before
I swear you taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through the years you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found I've found with you
Through the years I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I stayed right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found I've found with you
Through the years it's been an honor to be your friend
All of the love we share
And I'm so glad you're here right by my side
Through the years through the years

Sings a song

Ooh baby ooh said ooh

And the days go by
Like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own
I begin again

Said to my friend baby
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken hearted
Somethin' within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him all alone
On the edge of seventeen

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby ooh said ooh

I went today
Maybe I will go again
Tomorrow yeah yeah

Maybe I'll find love again

Something something
Something about this night

That no one really ever heard fall at all
Oh I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing
Come away come away

And for me yeah yeah
On the wings of the night
It's just wakin' up
And this love affair

Well the rain washes you
And the lightning hits ya
And then the love love love
Love love love
The rain washes you
And the lightning hits ya
And the love love yeah
Oh on the edge of seventeen
I want to know what love is
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is

A little time to look around me oooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

To change this lonely life

Well oh 
The sweetest thing I've ever known 
Was like the kiss on the collar bone 
Soft caress of happiness 
The way you walk your style of dress 
I wish I didn't get so weak 
Oooh baby just to hear you speak 
Makes me argue just to see 
How much you're in love with me 
See like a queen a queen upon her throne 
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I've known 
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I've known 

I get mad when you walk away 
So I tell you "Leave when I mean stay" 
Warm as the sun dip you're setting in 
It's the free way you're feeling I'm human I'm breathing 
Sexual healing is good for me 
Makes me feel so fine it's such a rush 
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us 
Sexual healing baby is good for me 
Sexual healing is something that's good for me 

Well it's good for me and it's so good to me my baby 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
I'm taking libido yeah love sweet feeling 
It's such a rush it's good for us 
Oh my baby come take control just grab a hold 
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it honey 
I'll be feeling relaxed and oh so comforted 
Sexual healing is good for me 
Makes me feel so fine it's such a rush 
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us 
Sexual healing baby is good for me 
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Sure Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Cool Night" by Paul Davis:

I sometimes wonder why
All the flowers had to die
I dream about you
And now Summer's come and gone
And the nights they seem so long
Come on over tonight come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
Oh when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old
Oh no

I remember the way
You used to laugh
When I'd kiss you goodbye
Ah but that was before
I got wise
Well I learned to hold you
And I learned to need you
And I'm never lettin' go
So come on and try
Now there's nothing left to hide

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
Oh when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old
Oh no oh no

And there's a change in the wind
That's blowin' through
And I'm hopin' like hell
It's blowin' straight to you

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
Oh when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
Oh when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old

Cool night whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Yes here are the uncensored lyrics for "Personally" by Karla Bonoff:

I look around me these days
I see you are everywhere
You're the star that shines above me
You're in the wind that's blowing through my hair

I taste your love in everything
The salt of sea is in my tears
Oh I see your eyes everywhere I turn
I hear your voice in a whisper in my ear

Personally I've got nothing to hide
No secret desires that I keep inside
I'm like a book an open book to read
For you to see personally

There's a path that I have chosen
And it's always lead straight to you
I've known you all my life
And I have loved you
Yes I have loved you

Personally I've got nothing to hide
No secret desires that I keep inside
I'm like a book an open book to read
For you to see personally

Oh oh oh
For you to see personally
Oh oh oh
Personally oh personally
I live every moment
Thinking of your love
It soothes me
It moves me
And I'm never giving up

Personally I've got nothing to hide
No secret desires that I keep inside
I'm like a book an open book to read
For you to see personally

Oh oh oh
For you to see personally
Oh oh oh
Personally oh personally
Blue eyes - Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep blue sea
On a blue blue day
Blue eyes - Baby's got blue eyes
When the morning comes
I'll be far away
And I say
Blue eyes - Holdin' back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again
Blue eyes - Holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again
Blue eyes - Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me
Blue eyes - Ooh I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see - Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home and I am home again
Oh

You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do something that you do

And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying inside
You're hiding inside
You're hurting me baby

I'll give you all I am
I'm giving you everything
I'm your man
Did it in a minute
You took your love and put me through it
I should have seen it coming
I should have started running

But I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it

You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do something that you do

And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying
You're hiding
You're hurting me

I'll give you all I am
And everything I'm gonna be
You're tearing up my heart
And my soul's bleeding
I'm feeling you baby
Didn't I see it coming
Didn't I feel it live
Wasn't I wanting
You all of the time

But I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it couldn't stop it
I couldn't stop it

Did it in a minute
Did it in a minute
Did it in a minute
I walked along the avenue 
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you 
Meet a girl like you 
With auburn hair and tawny eyes 
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through 
You hypnotize me through 
And I ran 
I ran so far away 
I just ran 
I ran all night and day 
I couldn't get away 
A cloud appears above your head 
A beam of light comes shining down on you 
Shining down on you 
The cloud is moving nearer still 
Aurora borealis comes in view 
Aurora comes in view 
And I ran 
I ran so far away 
I just ran 
I ran all night and day 
I couldn't get away 
Reached out a hand to touch your face 
You're slowly disappearing from my view 
Disappearing from my view 
Reached out a hand to try again 
I'm floating in a beam of light with you 
A beam of light with you 
And I ran 
I ran so far away 
I just ran 
I ran all night and day 
I couldn't get away
All right here are the uncensored lyrics of "Take It Away" by Paul McCartney:


Take it away wanna hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away don't you wanna stay
Till there's no one else around


Lonely driver out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor carry the load
Switching off the radio


Take it away let's hear you play
Till the night is gone
Take it away don't you wanna stay
Till there's nothing left to go on


Lonely driver out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor carry the load
Switching off the radio


Take it away let's hear you play
There's a brand new world to borrow
Take it away move into the lane
That tomorrow leads us to


Lonely driver out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor carry the load
Switching off the radio


Take it away wanna hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away don't you wanna stay
Till there's no one else around
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "It's Gonna Take a Miracle" by Deniece Williams:

Loving you so I was too blind to see you
Letting me go But now that you've gone away
I feel like I'm in a shadow of doubt
And I can't find my way

Chorus:
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
I'm used to getting what I want But now I'm just getting back
I was wrong to think that you would stay
I should have never ever pushed you away

I took your love for granted
Thought romance was second-hand
The next thing I knew You were gone like the wind
And I know that I have only myself to blame
Can't find my way back home

Chorus

Can't turn back the hands of time
On what I said what I did
Can't turn back the hands of time
But I would do anything to make it right

Chorus x2

What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain


And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Now it all looks strange

Saturday it was just another day
And I caught a glimpse of my reflection and murmured "Oh foolish me"
But it was Sunday now I'd give anything to be here
In his peace of mind
Yes it was Sunday I remember it all too well


The wheelbarrow sits by the garden gate
The cobblestone frame around the empty slate
And the cricket no longer sings
Who will be her lover

Come the springtime it's a busy world
But you'll find me tossing stones at the empty can
Peering in the room where he sat and spinning 'round
Fingers bleeding turning every page
Oh I guess I should have closed the book
Before leaving for the day

And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say
From each other
Even lover's need a holiday
Far away from each other


Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to


And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I cannot let go
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day
From your body


Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go


After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I cannot let go


Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go


After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
You're gonna be the lucky one
Alright here are the uncensored lyrics for "Sweet Dreams" by Air Supply:

The sucker for love
Had nothin' to do
But fall for a girl
'Cause love makes us fools

I know you're the one
I'd follow you blind
Let's take a chance
It's all in the mind

Sweet dreams my love
Set sail in the night
Sweet dreams my love
Things will be all right

We'll make it together
Stay with me now
Forever and ever

Makin' the choice
Was easy to do
But livin' with it
Is hard to pursue

But now that we're here
It's all clear to me
Our fantasies have reality

Sweet dreams my love
Set sail in the night
Sweet dreams my love
Things will be all right

We'll make it together
Stay with me now
Forever and ever

This love we'll cherish
Forevermore
This time we'll spend
Together we'll soar

Sweet dreams my love
Set sail in the night
Sweet dreams my love
Things will be all right

We'll make it together
Stay with me now
Forever and ever
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Comin' In and Out of Your Life" by Barbra Streisand:


I'm sitting here in the lonely light of morning
All my love was meant to be
Said you'd call when you got in
But I ain't heard a ding
Another night of waiting up for you
It's wearing thin


Comin' in and out of your life
Isn't easy when there's so many nights
And so many dreams
I'm trying to hold on to
They're comin' in and out of your life


I'm hanging on your words
Like I always used to do
The words they use so sweetly
Now they poison me
You're comin' in and out of my life
Takin' me for granted
Baby baby


Comin' in and out of your life
Isn't easy when there's so many nights
And so many dreams
I'm trying to hold on to
They're comin' in and out of your life


I'm finally facing it
This one-way masquerade
I'm gonna have to let you go
And take the hit we made


Comin' in and out of your life
Isn't easy when there's so many nights
And so many dreams
I'm trying to hold on to
They're comin' in and out of your life


Comin' in and out of your life
Comin' in and out of your life

You got the body now you want my soul
Don't even think about it say no go

That you want me to do yeah

That you want me to ooh

But I can't go for that nooo
No can do I can't go for that
Can't go for that can't go for that
I can't go for that can't go for that

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Mirror Mirror" by Diana Ross:

Mirror mirror on the wall
You said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall
Mirror mirror on the wall

You turned my life into a paperback novel
And now I think I know just a little too much
Mirror mirror you've done your duty
Can I break away from your spell

What's forever for
What's forever for
What's forever for
I've been looking at people
And how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds
Or they sit around and analyze
Every little thing they do or say
They're still the same old people
Just afraid to try why is that

What's forever for
What's forever for
What's forever for
Isn't love supposed to be
More than just a memory
I've been patient I've been kind
Tryin' to keep the faith that we will find
A way to a better day
For love to grow and not decay

What's forever for
What's forever for
What's forever for
What's forever for
What's forever for
What's forever for
Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself "Hey what've I found"

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do

The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart he's just he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
He's showing himself a really good time
He's laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do

The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do

The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart he's just he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
He's showing himself a really good time
He's laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do is fall in love
You could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone girl
For the hundredth time

I got your number on my wall
But I ain't gonna make that call
When divided we stand babe
United we fall

Got the time got a chance gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart gonna take it
All I know I can't fight this flame
You could have a change of heart
If you would only change your mind

Cos I'm crazy 'bout you baby
Time after time
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone

Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

I don't wanna fight no more
I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other baby
Like an act of war

I could tell a million lies
And it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger
Hits you right between the eyes

Cos I'm crazy 'bout you baby
Time after time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone

Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

Cos I'm crazy 'bout you baby
Crazy Crazy Crazy

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone

Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide
Verse 1:
I got a pocket full of quarters and I'm headed to the arcade
I don't have a lot of money but I'm bringing everything I made
I've got a can of root beer and my favorite jeans
I'm gonna eat some dots and chase some queens
Yeah

Chorus:
Pac-Man Fever it's driving me crazy
I'm Pac-Man Fever I'm out of my mind
I'm Pac-Man Fever I'm really quite ill
I'm Pac-Man Fever I don't know what to do
Verse 2:
I've got all the patterns down up until the ninth key
I've got Speedy on my tail and I know it's either him or me
So I'm heading out the back door and into the alleyway
I'm much too fast to last it's my lucky day
Chorus:
Pac-Man Fever it's driving me crazy
I'm Pac-Man Fever I'm out of my mind
I'm Pac-Man Fever I'm really quite ill
I'm Pac-Man Fever I don't know what to do
Bridge:
I'm not the type that gets concerned about the score
I can't win at Donkey Kong but I've had my moments that's for sure
I'm always at the mall never shop around I got a lot of quarters it's the best place to be found
Chorus:
Pac-Man Fever it's driving me crazy
I'm Pac-Man Fever I'm out of my mind
I'm Pac-Man Fever I'm really quite ill
I'm Pac-Man Fever I don't know what to do

Yes here are the uncensored lyrics of "Do You Believe in Love" by Huey Lewis and the News:

I was walking
Down a one-way street
Just a-looking
For someone to meet
One woman
Who was looking for a man
Now I'm hopin'
That The feeling is right
And I'm wonderin'
If You'll stay for the night
So I'm coming
I don't wanna be lonely
You Wanna be with me
Please believe me

Chorus
All these things I do
You Do they mean anything to you
Don't you believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't you see
What I'm tryin' to say
Don't you believe in love
Or do you believe this is just another day
I was savin'
For a minute or two
Just to spend them
With someone like you
Now I'm lonely
Oh-oh-oh You're the only one
I've been waiting For far too long
To see you Laughing And we'll finish the song
So I'm coming
I don't wanna be lonely
You Wanna be with me
Please believe me

Chorus x 2
Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics to "Love in the First Degree" by Alabama:

I once thought of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
So long ago I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free

But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never though that I would get caught
It seemed like the perfect crime


Baby you left me defenseless
I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key

I'm guilty of love in the first degree
I thought it would be so simple
Like a thousand times before
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door

Now babe I'm not begging for mercy
Go ahead and throw the book at me
If loving you's a crime I know that I'm
As guilty as a man can be



Baby you left me defenseless
I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key

I'm guilty of love in the first degree



Baby you left me defenseless
I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key

I'm guilty of love in the first degree
Can do Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Our Lips Are Sealed" by The Go-Go's:

Can you hear them
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well that's no surprise

Can you see them
See right through them
They have no shield
No secrets to reveal

It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed

There's a weapon
We must use
In our defense
Silence when you look at them
Look right through them

That's when they'll disappear
That's when we'll be feared

It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed

Hush my darling
Don't you cry
Quiet angel
Forget their lies

Can you hear them
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well that's no surprise

Can you see them
See right through them
They have no shield
No secrets to reveal

It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Abracadabra" by Steve Miller Band:

I heat up I can't cool down
You got me spinnin' 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me baby let the fire get higher
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra
You make me hot you make me sigh
You make me laugh you make me cry
Keep me burnin' for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra
I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face
I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say
Abra-abra-cadabra
I wanna reach out and grab ya
Abra-abra-cadabra
Abracadabra
I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Heat of the Moment" by Asia as they were originally written:

I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe this smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance
And incidence arose from circumstance
One thing led to another we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

And now you find yourself in '82
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

'Cause it's the heat of the moment
The heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself
Teenage ambitions you remember well

It was the heat of the moment
Telling you what your heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

It was the heat of the moment
The heat of the moment
The heat of the moment shown in your eyes

Verse 1:
I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like

Then to a suggestive movie 
There's nothing left to talk about 
Unless it's horizontally

Tried to keep my hands on the table

We know each other mentally 
You gotta know that you're bringin' out 
The animal in me
