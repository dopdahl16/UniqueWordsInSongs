Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "What's Love Got to Do with It" by Tina Turner:

You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

Oh what's love got to do got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it there's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

I've been taking on a new direction
And I have to say
I've been thinking 'bout my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

What good is love
if it hurts you all the time
We've both had our share of misfortunes
so how come we're lucky tonight
Don't wanna be a fool for ya
just another player in your game for two
you may hate me but it ain't no lie
baby bye bye bye
Don't you wanna be free
Can't you see that these eyes are blind
Don't you wanna be free
True love is a bird in flight
why hold down to what you can't have
Why pretend that everything is fine
when your heart tells you that it's all wrong
Don't wanna be a fool for ya
just another player in your game for two
you may hate me but it ain't no lie
baby bye bye bye
Hold me if it's not too late
hold me and let me rest against you tonight
Say Say Say what you want
but don't play games with my affection
Take Take Take what you need
but don't leave me with no direction
All alone I sit home by the phone
waiting for you baby
Dailin' that phone waiting for you baby
Take me higher all alone I sit home by the phone
waiting for you baby
Dailin' that phone waiting for you baby
Say Say Say what you want
when you are gone
it's like I'm lost at sea
I'm singing songs of loneliness
always searching for a dream that never comes
Don't wanna be a fool for you
just another player in your game for two
you may hate me but it ain't no lie
baby bye bye bye
Hold me if it's not too late
hold me and let me rest against you tonight
Say Say Say what you want
but don't play games with my affection
Take Take Take what you need
but don't leave me with no direction
How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking
Every breath with you ooh ooh
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears

So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Ooh take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why

You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Now take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you well that's all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take

Take a look at me now


Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh 
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh 


I get up and nothing gets me down
You got it tough I've seen the toughest around
And I know baby just how you feel
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real


Can't you see me standing here 
I've got my back against the record machine 
I ain't the worst that you've seen 
Can't you see what I mean 


Might as well jump jump 
Might as well jump 
Go ahead and jump jump
Go ahead and jump 


Aaa-ohh hey you
Who said that
Baby how you been
You say you don't know
You won't know until you begin 


Can't you see me standing here 
I've got my back against the record machine 
I ain't the worst that you've seen 
Can't you see what I mean 


Might as well jump 
Jump 
Might as well jump 
Jump 
J ump 




Can't you see me standing here 
I've got my back against the record machine 
I ain't the worst that you've seen 
Can't you see what I mean 


Might as well jump 
Jump 
Go ahead and jump 
Jump 
Might as well jump 
Jump 
Go ahead and jump 
Jump 


Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh 
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh 
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh 
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh 
Might as well jump jump 
Go ahead and jump 
Might as well jump jump 
Go ahead and jump 
Might as well jump jump 
Go ahead and jump 
Might as well jump jump 
Go ahead and jump 
Might as well jump jump 
Go ahead and jump
Verse 1:
I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello is it me you're looking for

Chorus:
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much I love you

Verse 2:
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello I've just got to let you know

Chorus:
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying I love you

Bridge:
Hello is it me you're looking for
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you

Chorus:
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying I love you
Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or loser

See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you and that's the only way
Shake shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You - lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart
After my own decision
They confused me so
Owner of a lonely heart
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
Owner of a lonely heart
And don't you hesitate at all - no no

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
Desert loving in your eyes all the way  
If I listen to your lies would you say  
I'm a man without conviction  
I'm a man who doesn't know  
How to sell a contradiction  
You come and go you come and go

Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon  
You come and go you come and go

Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream  
Red gold and green red gold and green

Didn't hear your wicked words every day  
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say  
That my love was an addiction  
When we cling our love is strong  
When you go you're gone forever  
You string along you string along

Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon  
You come and go you come and go

Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream  
Red gold and green red gold and green

Every day is like survival  
You're my lover not my rival  
Every day is like survival  
You're my lover not my rival

Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon  
You come and go you come and go

Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream  
Red gold and green red gold and green

Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon  
You come and go you come and go

Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream  
Red gold and green red gold and green
Every time I think of you  
I always catch my breath  
And I'm still standing here  
And you're miles away  
And I'm wondering why you left  
And there's a storm that's raging  
Through my frozen heart tonight  
I hear your name in certain circles  
And it always makes me smile  
I spend my time  
Thinking about you  
And it's almost driving me wild  
And there's a heart that's breaking  
Down this long distance line tonight  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter what I might say  
There's a message in the wires  
And I'm sending you this signal tonight  
You don't know how desperate I've become  
And it looks like I'm losing this fight  
In your world I have no meaning  
Though I'm trying hard to understand  
And it's my heart that's breaking  
Down this long distance line tonight  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter what my friends say  
And there's a message that I'm sending out  
Like a telegraph to your soul  
And if I can't bridge this distance  
Stop this heartbreak overload  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter what my friends say  
I ain't missing you missing you  
I ain't missing you missing you  
I keep lying to myself  
And there's a storm that's raging  
Through my frozen heart tonight  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
I ain't missing you  
No matter what my friends say  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you

I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

They just wanna

Girls they wanna have fun

Girls they wanna have fun
Girls wanna
Wanna have fun
Girls wanna have

Oh girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna
They just wanna

They just wanna
They just wanna

Girls just wanna have fun
Just wanna have fun
Cut the the pastel dreams treat me like a patient
Just when I thought I'd make it through
I'm a servant of fire you know that's what I am
Throw away my desire baby I'm a guilty man

The reflex is an only child he's waiting in the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does leaves you answered with a question mark

I'm on a ride and I wanna get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and the TV set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out

The reflex is an only child he's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does leaves you answered with a question mark

The reflex what a game he's hiding all the cards
The reflex is up on the roof he's got a secret stash
No one knows what he's holding back

The reflex is an only child he's waiting in the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does leaves you answered with a question mark

Your eyes tell me how you love me
Can feel it in your heartbeat
I know you like what you see
Hold me I'll give that you need


Wrap your arms around me
Make me feel your love
Jump for my love
Jump in
And feel my touch
Jump if you want to take my kisses in the night
Jump jump for my love


You told me I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try and go much farther
Oh baby you're the one you you are the one


Wrap your arms around me
Make me feel your love
Jump for my love
Jump in
And feel my touch
Jump if you want to take my kisses in the night
Jump jump for my love


When your heart is burning up
And you're ready for some love
Don't hesitate a minute more
Come and get my love
Don't you know that


Wrap your arms around me
Make me feel your love
Jump for my love
Jump in
And feel my touch
Jump if you want to take my kisses in the night
Jump jump for my love

When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things that you're dreamin' about
When you open up your heart and the truth comes out


You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right 'cause I hear it in the night


I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep


You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right 'cause I hear it in the night


When you tell me that you love me
Don't know how I'm supposed to feel
Hearing what you're saying you know that it's real
I can hear it in the night hear it in the night


You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right 'cause I hear it in the night


I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
Oh the night is my world   
City light painted girl   
In the day nothing matters   
It's the night time that flatters   
In the night no control   
Through the wall something's breaking   
Wearing white as you're walkin'   
Down the street of my soul   
You take myself you take my self-control   
You got me livin' only for the night   

Before the morning comes the story's told   
You take yourself you take my self-control   
Another night another day goes by   
I never stop myself to wonder why   
You help me to forget to play   
And let me dance away   

I don't know what's come over me   
You've got me feelin' emotions   
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of   
Oh the patterns of my heart   
Feel like I'm in a bad romance   
But I don't wanna run away   

Baby you're the one I've been waiting for   
I can see it in your eyes   
You take myself you take my self-control   
You got me livin' only for the night   

Before the morning comes the story's told   
You take yourself you take my self-control   
Another night another day goes by   
I never stop myself to wonder why   
You help me to forget to play   
And let me dance away   

Oh the night is my world   
City light painted girl   
In the day nothing matters   
It's the night time that flatters   
You are the one who knows how to party   
And come and move my way yeah   

You take myself you take my self-control   
You got me livin' only for the night   
Before the morning comes the story's told   
You take yourself you take my self-control   
Another night another day goes by   
I never stop myself to wonder why   
You help me to forget to play   
And let me dance away   

Oh the night is my world   
City light painted girl   
In the day nothing matters   
It's the night time that flatters   
You help me to forget to play   
And let me dance away
Dearly beloved 
We are gathered here today 
To get through this thing called "life" 

Electric word life 
It means forever and that's a mighty long time 
But I'm here to tell you 
There's something else 
The afterworld 

A world of never-ending happiness 
You can always see the sun day or night 

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills 
You know the one Dr Everything'll Be Alright 
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left 
Ask him how much of your mind baby 

'Cause in this life 
Things are much harder than in the afterworld 
In this life 
You're on your own 

And if the elevator tries to bring you down 
Go crazy punch a higher floor 

If you don't like the world you're living in 
Take a look around you 
At least you got friends 

You see I called my old lady 
For a friendly word 
She picked up the phone 
Dropped it on the floor 
Ah ah is all I heard 

Are we gonna let the elevator 
Bring us down 
Oh no let's go 

Let's go crazy 
Let's get nuts 
Let's look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck let's go 

We're all excited 
But we don't know why 
Maybe it's 'cause 
We're all gonna die 
And when we do When we do 
What's it all for What's it all for 
You better live now 
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door 

Tell me are we gonna let the elevator bring us down 
Oh no let's go 

Let's go crazy 
Let's get nuts 
Look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck 
Let's go 

C'mon baby 
Let's get nuts 
Yeah 
Crazy 
Let's go crazy 

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down 
Oh no let's go 

Go crazy 
I said let's go crazy 
Crazy 

Let's go 
Let's go 
Go 
Let's go 

Dr Everything'll Be Alright 
Make everything go wrong 
Pills and thrills and daffodils 
Will kill 

Hang tough children 

He's coming 
He's coming 
Coming 

Take me away

No problem here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Just Called to Say I Love You" by Stevie Wonder:

No New Year's Day to celebrate  
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away  
No first of spring no song to sing  
In fact it's just another ordinary day

No April rain  
No flowers bloom  
No wedding Saturday within the month of June  
But what it is is something true  
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you  
I just called to say how much I care  
I just called to say I love you  
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high  
No warm July  
No harvest moon to light one tender August night  
No autumn breeze  
No falling leaves  
No Libra sun  
No Halloween  

But what it is though old so new  
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you  
I just called to say how much I care  
I just called to say I love you  
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you  
I just called to say how much I care  
I just called to say I love you  
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Last night I had a strangest dream  
I sailed away to China  
In a little row boat to find ya  
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned  

Didn't want no one to hold you  
What does that mean  
And you said  
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
Nobody gonna slow me down  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  

You're on a roll and now you pray it lasts  
The road behind was rocky  
But now you're feeling cocky  
You look at me and you see your past  
Is that the reason why you're running so fast  
And she said  

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
Nobody gonna slow me down  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  

Never let another girl like you  
Whip me over oh no  
I'll do it all again  
I'll never let another girl like you  
Whip me over oh no  
I'll do it all again  

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
Nobody gonna slow me down  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
Nobody gonna slow me down  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
Nobody gonna slow me down  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
Nobody gonna slow me down  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'  
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride  
I'm running and I won't touch ground  
Oh no I got to keep on movin'
Have you got a good reason
For taking the radioactive toys
For taking the precious people
To throw with the cold dice
Maybe because of paranoia
Or because of Nostradamus
Or because of a certain gentleman
Who's watching the world at his leisure
Without care and without hurry
He laughs about mankind
Who doesn't see the airships
Near the horizon
99 balloons
On their way to the horizon
People think they're UFOs from space
So a general sent up
A fighter squadron after them
Sound the alarm if it's so
But there on the horizon were only
99 balloons
99 fighter jets
Each one's a great warrior
Thought they were Captain Kirk
Then came a lot of fireworks
The neighbours didn't understand anything
And felt like they were being provoked
So they shot at the horizon
At 99 balloons
99 war ministers
Matches and gasoline canisters
They thought they were clever people
Already smelled a nice bounty
Calling for war and wanting power
Man who would've thought
That things would someday go that far
Because of 99 balloons
Because of 99 balloons
99 years of war
Left no room for victors
There are no more war ministers
Nor any jet fighters today
But at the sky you can see
A thousand balloons
Someone's out there beyond the horizon
Just watchin' us and do they have to tell
A story of 99 balloons
And that such a thing
Comes from such a thing

Keep in mind that the lyrics may contain mature language and themes

There are times when I lose my senses
And my pastime is vicious and reckless
This world can be so senseless
When your whole life can feel so defenseless oh

But darlin' you can't stand by me
No you can't stand by me
You can't stand by me no
You can't stand by
Darlin' darlin' you can't stand by me

If we can dance together
If we can talk forever
If we can hold each other
Then we can have it all have it all
If we can dream together
If we can sew these seams
If we can hold each other
Then we can have it all have it all

There are nightmares that plague us all oh
The ghost in the hallway I know
That bedroom became my whole world
When everything else was a nightmare oh

Darlin' you can't stand by me
No you can't stand by me
You can't stand by me no
You can't stand by
Darlin' darlin' you can't stand by me

If we can dance together
If we can talk forever
If we can hold each other
Then we can have it all have it all
If we can dream together
If we can sew these seams
If we can hold each other
Then we can have it all have it all

If we can dream together
If we can sew these seams
If we can hold each other
Then we can have it all

Darlin' you can't stand by me
No you can't stand by me
You can't stand by me no
You can't stand by
Darlin' darlin' you can't stand by me
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "The Glamorous Life" by Sheila E:

She wears a long fur coat of mink
Even in the summertime
Everybody knows from the coy little wink
The girl's got a lot on her mind
She's got big thoughts big dreams
And a big brown Mercedes sedan
What I think this girl she really wants
Is to be in love with a man

She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much

She saw him standing in the section marked
"If you have to ask you can't afford"
That means you can't afford her
Tapped her foot and nodded her head
She said "Truly I ain't got no use for this"
You forget but she don't forget
"But you you'd look alright even if you're in handcuffs handcuffs"
She said "Uh do you wanna make love or what"
What you want

She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much

She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much

Ah-ah oh oh
Ah-ah oh oh
Ah-ah oh oh
Yeah

The glamorous life
Ah-ah oh oh
Ah-ah oh oh
Ah-ah oh oh
Yeah
Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Stuck on You" by Lionel Richie:

Stuck on you
Got this feeling down deep in my soul
that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you till the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

I'm stuck on you
Been a fool too long I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Oh I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time little darling
I'm coming home to stay

I'm stuck on you
Got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you till the end
Guess I'm on my way
I'm mighty glad you stayed
Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just staring into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself

Something in the way you love me
Something in the way you do
Something in the way you love me
It's got me feeling like I can't be without you


Whenever you're with me
You make me feel so alive
Suddenly I'm a poet
And you're my poetry mm


I got to say you got me
Where you want me baby
And I just can't get enough
Can't get enough
I got to say you got me
Where you want me baby
And I just can't get enough
Can't get enough


Every time that I think of you
I feel shot right through
With a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine
But it's a problem I find


Living a life that I can't leave behind
There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows uh-oh


I got to say you got me
Where you want me baby
And I just can't get enough
Can't get enough
I got to say you got me
Where you want me baby
And I just can't get enough
Can't get enough


Something in the way you love me
Something in the way you do
Something in the way you touch me
I don't want to live without you


I got to say you got me
Where you want me baby
And I just can't get enough
Can't get enough
I got to say you got me
Where you want me baby
And I just can't get enough
Can't get enough


I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough yeah
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough yeah
I wear my sunglasses at night 
So I can so I can 
Watch you weave then breathe your story lines 
And I wear my sunglasses at night 
I wear my sunglasses at night 
So I can so I can 
Keep track of visions in my eyes 
While she's deceiving me 
It cuts my security 
Has she got control of me 
I turn to her and say 
Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades oh no 
Don't masquerade with the guy in shades oh no 
I can't believe it 
You got it made with the guy in shades oh no 
I wear my sunglasses at night 
So I can so I can 
Forget my name while you collect your claim 
And I wear my sunglasses at night 
I wear my sunglasses at night 
So I can so I can 
See the light that's right before my eyes 
While she's deceiving me 
She cuts my security 
Has she got control of me 
I turn to her and say 
Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades oh no 
Don't masquerade with the guy in shades oh no 
I can't believe it 
You got it made with the guy in shades oh no 
I say "Don't tease me" 
And "Don't leave me in the dark" 
No "Don't tease me" 
And "Don't leave me in the dark" 
I wear my sunglasses at night 
So I can so I can 
Watch you weave then breathe your story lines 
And I wear my sunglasses at night 
I wear my sunglasses at night 
So I can so I can 
Keep track of the visions in my eyes
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Uptown Girl" by Billy Joel:

Uptown girl she's been living in her uptown world  
I bet she never had a backstreet guy  
I bet her mama never told her why  

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl  
She's been living in her white bread world  
As long as anyone with hot blood can  
And now she's looking for a downtown man  
That's what I am  

And when she knows what she wants from her time  
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind  
She'll see I'm not so tough  
Just because  
I'm in love with an uptown girl  

You know I've seen her in her uptown world  
She's getting tired of her high class toys  
And all her presents from her uptown boys  
She's got a choice  

Uptown girl you know I can't afford to buy her pearls  
But maybe someday when my ship comes in  
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been  
And then I'll win  

And when she's walking  
She's looking so fine  
And when she's talking  
She'll say that she's mine  
She'll say I'm not so tough  
Just because  
I'm in love with an uptown girl  

She's been living in her white bread world  
As long as anyone with hot blood can  
And now she's looking for a downtown man  
That's what I am  

Uptown girl she's my uptown girl  
You know I'm in love  
With an uptown girl  
My uptown girl  
You know I'm in love  
With an uptown girl  
My uptown girl  
You know I'm in love  
With an uptown girl  
My uptown girl

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Twist of Fate" by Olivia Newton-John as requested:

Do you wanna win or lose tonight
It's your decision cause I just wanna feel alright
You're just a plaything and I ain't waiting for no ring
Let's take a chance on romance tonight

I wanna make you mine I wanna hold you tight
I wanna make you feel like I feel tonight
So take a chance with me we'll make our own destiny
A little twist of fate we'll be alright

Don't say it's wrong don't say it's right
Just hold me close and love me through the night
We'll make a memory that'll never fade away
A little twist of fate we'll be okay

I wanna taste your lips I wanna feel your skin
I wanna know the way that you move within
So take a chance with me we'll make our own destiny
A little twist of fate we'll be alright

Don't say it's wrong don't say it's right
Just hold me close and love me through the night
We'll make a memory that'll never fade away
A little twist of fate we'll be okay

I'm not looking for forever just a little bit of pleasure
So come on baby let's just fly away
A little twist of fate we'll be okay

Don't say it's wrong don't say it's right
Just hold me close and love me through the night
We'll make a memory that'll never fade away
A little twist of fate we'll be okay
Telegram force and ready
I knew this was a big mistake
There's a fine line drawing my senses
Together and there's nothing I'm craving
Your picture speaks a thousand words
As I open the box your silver lining to cloud
I'm on a ride and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold my soul for the second time
'Cause the man don't pay me
I begged for sunshine you gave me darkness
And now my Sun it's gone
I'm on a black-widow ride figure of eight
And I'm feeling reckless restless
Huddled in the corner
Forces on the border
Isn't it amazing how I survived this wreckless life
Foolish lies degrade our history
I'll slit the jugular vein and ascend to sound
Could you be the devil
Could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like going floating
Leave my heart running
You're my heart runner
Repeat Chorus
New York New York is everything they say
And no place that I'd rather be
Where else can you do a half a million things
All at a quarter to three

When they play their music ooh that modern music
They like it with a lot of style
But it's still that same old backbeat rhythm
That really really drives 'em wild

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll heart of rock and roll is still beating

LA Hollywood and the Sunset Strip
Is something everyone should see
Neon lights and the pretty pretty girls
All dressed so scantily

When they play their music that hard rock music
They like it with a lot of flash
But it's still that same old backbeat rhythm
That really really kicks 'em in the sighs yeah

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll heart of rock and roll is still beating

DC San Antone and the Liberty Town
Boston and Baton Rouge
Tulsa Austin Oklahoma City
Seattle San Francisco too

Everywhere there's music real live music
Bands with a million styles
But it's still that same old rock and roll music
That really really drives 'em wild

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll heart of rock and roll is still beating

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll heart of rock and roll is still beating beating beating
Silent - I can't wait to hear your voice again
I remember when your whisper seemed so loud
Those were the days when love was what we lived for
So open up your heart and I'll unlock the door

You're the warrior
And I'm your worrier
And everything you say
Will take me higher and higher
Warrior
I'm your worrier
And every word you say
Takes me where I want to go

Danger - we're walking through a minefield
I can feel the earth exploding at my feet
The only way to keep on moving forward
Is to keep your head held high and never lose your beat

You're the warrior
And I'm your worrier
And everything you say
Will take me higher and higher
Warrior
I'm your worrier
And every word you say
Takes me where I want to go

Once upon a time
You said forever and always
But promises can break so easily
One moment never lasts
But I believe that what we're building
Will transcend the boundaries of our hearts and minds

You're the warrior
And I'm your worrier
And everything you say
Will take me higher and higher
Warrior
I'm your worrier
And every word you say
Takes me where I want to go
We'll love again
Though it just might take a while
Excerpt paraphrased 

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever 
This time we'll never end
If ever you're in my arms again

The love we had before
We'll try to rediscover
And make it even better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
Certainly the uncensored lyrics of "Let the Music Play" by Shannon are as follows:

We started dancing
And love put us into a groove
As soon as we started to move
The music played
While our bodies displayed through the dance
Then love picked us out for romance

I thought it was clear
The plan was we would share
This feeling just between ourselves
But when the music changed
The plan was re-arranged
He went to dance with someone else

We started dancing
And love put us into a groove
As soon as we started to move
The music played
While our bodies displayed through the dance
Then love picked us out for romance

Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can't you see my love shine through the dark
Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can't you see my love shine through the dark

Love love love love love love
To all the girls I’ve loved before

Who traveled in and out my door

I’m glad they came along

I dedicate this song

To all the girls I’ve loved before

To all the girls I once caressed

And may I say I’ve held the best

For helping me to grow I owe a lot I know

To all the girls I’ve loved before

The winds of change are always blowing

And every time I try to stay

The winds of change continue blowing

And they just carry me away

To all the girls who’ve shared my life

Who now are someone else’s wives

I’m glad they came along I dedicate this song

To all the girls I’ve loved before

To all the girls who cared for me

Who filled my nights with ecstasy

They live within my heart I’ll always be a part

Of all the girls I’ve loved before
Verse 1:
Just as I thought it was going alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same it's just a shame that's all

Verse 2:
I could say day and you'd say night
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
Always the same it's just a shame that's all

Chorus:
I could leave but I won't go
Though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you you looking at me
It's always the same it's just a shame that's all

Verse 3:
Turning me on turning me off
Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time
Running around staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time

Chorus:
I could leave but I won't go
Though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me looking at you you looking at me
It's always the same it's just a shame that's all

Outro:
I could say day you'd say night
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same it's just a shame that's all
It's always the same it's just a shame that's all
The night is hot like my fantasy
I'll be in love not just feeling free
Cause I'm out hunting taking everything
It's all about the thrill the hunt's begun

I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night
I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night

I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night
I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night

I'll play the game but I'll never stop
Cause I'm on fire that's why I'm hot hot
I'm runnin' through the streets I'm takin' chances
And I'm still feeling lucky oh my heart is racing

I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night
I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night

I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night
I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night

People staring always watching me
Innocence forsaken I'm a lusty free
I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night
I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night

I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night
I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night

I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night
I'm runnin' with the night runnin' with the night
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
`Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know
Turn them on turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
and it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues
Sad songs they say
Saddest words alone
I can sing along I can sing along
Blue Blue
Turn them on turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on
Sad songs
They say
Saddest words alone
They say
So much
Baby when I met you
There was peace unknown
I set out to get you
With a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together-ah huh
Making love with each other-ah huh

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other ah-ah
From one lover to another ah-ah

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
And the message is clear: this could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never

We started and finished as if we were lovers
And some were convinced it was just a one-night stand
But we stayed together ah huh
And we wrote our history
And there's nothin' left to say ah huh
But that you - you - you 're the one for me ah huh

And if you don't know how great mature love is
Well baby now you know
And if you don't feel it well then you never will
And I do mean never
What makes you think love will end when you know that my whole life depends
On you on you
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
On you
We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises no demands
Love is a battlefield

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing

Love is a battlefield

You're begging me to go
Then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad
It would help me to know

Do I stand in your way
Or am I the best thing you've had
Believe me believe me
I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love
And I'm chained to your side

We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises no demands
Love is a battlefield

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing

Love is a battlefield

When we lose control
Of our feelings
The only thing
That's left to do
Is walk away

I see you're in love
With a girl
You say
You're gonna get your
Heart broken someday

Don't let her get away
Don't let her get away
Don't let her get away

We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises no demands
Love is a battlefield

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing

Love is a battlefield

We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises no demands
Love is a battlefield

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing

Love is a battlefield

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "If This Is It" by Huey Lewis and the News:

I've been phoning
Night and morning
I heard you say "Tell him I'm not home"
Now you're confessing
But I'm still guessing
I've been your fool for so so long

Girl don't lie
Just to save my feelings
Girl don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong

Girl don't try
To make up phony reasons
I'd rather leave than never believe
If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love you'd better let me go
If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love baby just say so
You've been thinking
And I've been drinking
We both know that it's just not right
Now you're pretending
That it's not ending
You'll say anything to avoid a fight

Girl don't lie
And tell me that you need me
Girl don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong

I'll be alright one way or another
So let me go or make me stay
If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love you'd better let me go
If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love baby just say so

If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love you'd better let me go
If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love baby just say so

If this is it
If this is it baby
If this is it just say so baby
Verse 1:
You might think I'm crazy
To hang around with you
Maybe you think I'm lucky
To have something to do

But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child
You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue
You might think I'm crazy
But all I want is you

Chorus:
You might think it's hysterical
But I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies
And everything's so deep
But I think that you're bluffing
With those tears that you're crying
You might think it's foolish
What you're about to say
But I think you're beautiful
And I don't want to change a thing

Verse 2:
I think you're crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

Chorus:
You might think it's foolish
What you're about to say
But I think you're beautiful
And I don't want to change a thing
You might think you're nothing
But I'll keep you hanging around
Foolish
You got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger
Do you have to Do you have to
Do you have to let it linger

Outro:
You might think I'm foolish
But I can't help it
I'm just a fool for you
You might think I'm foolish
But that's nothing new
You might think it's foolish
But I can't help it
I'm just a fool for you
Verse 1:
Well you think we're all insane
Oh well this we will defend
We don't care about the money
We don't care about the rent no
We're just livin' for the minute
We're just hangin' by a thread
Oh we don't want to wait until tomorrow
Why not do it all today

Chorus:
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild wild wild
Wild wild wild

Verse 2:
So you think I got an evil mind
Well I'll tell you honey
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
So you think my singin's out of time
Well it makes me money
And I don't know why
And I don't know why anymore oh no

Chorus:
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild wild wild
Wild wild wild

Bridge:
Cum on feel the noize
We'll get wild wild wild
Cum on feel the noize
We'll get wild wild wild

Chorus:
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild wild wild
Wild wild wild
They're checking all the salesmen  
Making sure that no one is bumming  
They're taking down the names  
And cutting straight deals  
To the fan belt blues  
Plus they told you to remember  
The rights of the buyer  
As well as the seller  
In each and every deal  

Coaching takes talent  
A real sincere affection  
Compulsive obsession  
Don't you take me to the cleaners  
For some time with a hack in a uniform  
Doing a blue rock dance in the back  
Bonds made of tension  
Amusement intervention  
Is my intention to be  
Oblique

Inspiration date hits you like a case of lead  
Oh we all have kissed the bride  
And later you regret  
The frosting stains the nightgown  
And the stains won't come out  
It's just another white wedding  
Mrs Punchline  
Is mad at the salesmen  
For leaving out a word  
She says that he lacks vision  
But she's some kind of blind herself  
Can't see what's wrong with a little grind  
She don't mind  
But just in case you get sick  
Or you die well the last rites  
Come and stand in line for a brand new thing

Tell 'em Tracy


People say we're not aware
Of what's going on in other's lives
Well let me tell you somethin'
When you're sufferin' that's when you realize


That's they don't know about us
They've never heard of love
They don't know you can't break a heart that's already hurt
They don't know the way it feels to love somebody
The way I love you


No they don't And there's nothing you can do or say
You can't change their minds
It's just a fact of life we're different
We're worlds apart we're not the same


No they don't They don't know about us
They've never heard of love
They don't know you can't break a heart that's already hurt
They don't know the way it feels to love somebody
The way I love you


They don't know how it feels
And they don't know what it's like
To love somebody love somebody the way I love you


No they don't They don't know about us
They've never heard of love
They don't know you can't break a heart that's already hurt
They don't know the way it feels to love somebody
The way I love you


No they don't They don't know about us
No they don't They've never heard of love
No they don't They don't know about us
No they don't They've never heard of love
Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by

Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie

I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But I'm not above making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel

I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young

I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man

I am an innocent man

Oh yes I am

Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before

Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that's it's easier to hate
Than to wait anymore

I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there and if I can survive
I can keep you alive

I'm not above going through it again
I'm not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me I'll understand
Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man

Oh yes I am an innocent man

And I need a good defense
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I’ve sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Wind and whistle and the heels of my feet
I’m breathing in cold air tonight
Somebody close by said he heard a heartbeat
And we got so close we could hear each other sigh
We were standing in the door way looking him
There was so much love to be made
I can still hear those words
Running around inside my head
We were just kids but there was a warmth that night
I’d never felt but knew I’d always need
A new coat a new winter
And I’m walking on these streets
I need you I need you -- Oh oh --
Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning
I sit around
Trying to smile but
The air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying
What did they say
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand

It's a cruel cruel cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel it's a cruel cruel summer
Now you're gone

The city is crowded
My friends are away
And I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I gotta get up and go
What will you do now
It's a cruel cruel cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel it's a cruel cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
To have a party
To have a party
But every time
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
I feel a heat wave
Feel a heat wave
Startin' in my heart
Startin' in my heart

It's a cruel cruel cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel it's a cruel cruel summer
Now you're gone

It's a cruel cruel cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel it's a cruel cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Oh whoa-oh
It's a cruel cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel it's a cruel cruel summer
Now you're gone
Two loves I have oh my glory
One's religion and one's misery
I need them both oh and oh they need me

Well I'll never be the one to blame
Well I'll never be the one to shame
And I will not stand in your way

When you dance hall days have gone
And your baby's gone gone gone do it
When your dance hall days are gone
And you're baby baby baby tonight tonight is good

Two hearts beat in my breast oh tender
One feeds fire and one's temper
Don't give up your lover tonight

Well I'll never be the one to blame
And I'll never be the one to claim
And I will not stand in your way

So dance hall days have gone
And your baby's gone gone gone do it
When your dance hall days are gone
And you're baby baby baby tonight tonight is good

So don't you bother with me I'm not the fool

When your dance hall days have gone
And your baby baby baby tonight tonight is good
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside

And I know I know I know I know I know I want you

I'm so excited And I think I like it hey
I'm so excited You got me burning up
Verse 1:
I should have known when I had you alone
That it wouldn't last I never should have let you go
Cause I I still don't understand why
I'm talking to myself at night and crying oh

Chorus:
Oh I still can't get over loving you
I still can't get over you
I still can't get over loving you
I still can't get over you

Verse 2:
I feel your touch every time the wind blows
Whispers in my ears reminding me of what I know
That I I still don't understand why
I'm talking to myself at night and crying oh

Chorus:
Oh I still can't get over loving you
I still can't get over you
I still can't get over loving you
I still can't get over you

Bridge:
I can see you in my mind
And you're with me all the time
It's so hard to let you go
When I need you so

Chorus:
Oh I still can't get over loving you
I still can't get over you
I still can't get over loving you
I still can't get over you
It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike

You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes girl
Thriller thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time they're open wide
This is the end of your life ooh

There's demons closin' in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial

For you and I to cuddle close together yeah

And rot inside a corpse's shell

There's a black man with a black cat livin' in a black neighborhood
He's got an interstate running' through his front yard
You know he thinks that he's got it so good
And there's a woman in the kitchen cleaning' up the evening slop
And he looks at her and says "Hey darlin' I can remember when you could stop a clock"
Oh but ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see baby
Ain't that America home of the free
Little pink houses for you and me oh baby for you and me
Well there's a young man in a t-shirt
Listenin' to a rockin' rollin' station
He's got greasy hair greasy smile
He says "Lord this must be my destination"
'Cause they told me when I was younger
Boy you're gonna be president
But just like everything else those old crazy dreams
Just kinda came and went
Oh but ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see baby
Ain't that America home of the free
Little pink houses for you and me oh baby for you and me

And the pills that kill

Surely Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Dancing in the Sheets" by Shalamar:


We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' to the beat
We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' and swaying to the rhythm of the beat


I feel the heat
The rhythm flows
I've got the music in me you know
Want to dance
Yeah all night long
With you baby I'm feeling strong


We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' to the beat
We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' and swaying to the rhythm of the beat


The music's fade
We're still going strong
Every time we dance it goes on and on
And on and on and on and on and on
And if this dance takes us into the night
I know that everything's gonna be alright


We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' to the beat
We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' and swaying to the rhythm of the beat


Dancing in the sheets oh
Dancing in the sheets oh
Dancing in the sheets oh
Dancing in the sheets oh


We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' to the beat
We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' and swaying to the rhythm of the beat


Dancing in the sheets oh

Dancing in the sheets oh
Dancing in the sheets oh


We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' to the beat
We're dancing in the sheets
We're movin' and swaying to the rhythm of the beat
You got no reply
They raided the town
The kingpin of this underland
Had fallen and he lost his crown
A villa real invader
Bay of pigs and the CIA

Undercover of the night
The sex police are out there on the streets
Make sure the pass laws are not broken
The race militia has got itchy fingers
All the way from Washington
So you remember the juntas in Argentina
They grabbed onto the power with their fingertips
Amongst the growing pains you know you got to persevere
Until the cables have been stripped
Undercover

By way of darkness prosperity
And under the cover of night
Saxomophone
Sticks of dynamite
The telephone know and the tears know
They call them the grazed knees
So you think I got a funny face
I ain't got no worries
Undercover of the night
The sex police are out there on the streets
Make sure the pass laws are not broken
The race militia has got itchy fingers
All the way from Washington
Capitol 1212
All the peaceniks are just hippies gone wild
And all the warmongers are just old hippies
Gone old
And all the hippies have got assassination plots

Shake up the picture the lizard mixture
With your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers
All of which I deny
I said it again
Could I please rephrase it
Maybe I can catch a ride
I couldn't really put it much plainer
But I'll wait till you decide


Send me your warning siren
And I'll be your king of the wild frontier
Come bazaar oh superstar
Jean Paul Belmondo's got nothing on me
Coming up coming up coming up
Like a flower
Coming up I I I

You're the blessed we get busted
Both of us oh wanting more
One of us oh would've liked to have kissed
The curves of the earth
The ground we're so common
Our world shows nothing girl
I'll show you in spring it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats


Send me your warning siren
And I'll be your king of the wild frontier
Come bazaar oh superstar
Jean Paul Belmondo's got nothing on me
Coming up coming up coming up
Like a flower
Coming up I I I


Hey hey sha la la
Hey hey

Hey hey sha la la
Hey hey

You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line
I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand oh
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand


Send me your warning siren
And I'll be your king of the wild frontier
Come bazaar oh superstar
Jean Paul Belmondo's got nothing on me
Coming up coming up coming up
Like a flower
Coming up I I I
Standing there alone  
The ship is waiting  
All systems are go  
Are you sure  
Control is not convinced  
But the computer  
Has the evidence  
No need to abort  
The countdown starts  

Watching in a trance  
The crew is certain  
Nothing left to chance  
All is working  
Trying to relax  
Up in the capsule  
"Send me up a drink"  
Jokes Major Tom  

The count goes on  
Four three two one  
Earth below us  
Drifting falling  
Floating weightless  
Calling calling home  

Second stage is cut  
We're now in orbit  
Stabilizers up  
Running perfect  
Starting to collect  
Requested data  
"What will it affect  
When all is done"  
Thinks Major Tom  

Back at ground control  
There is a problem  
"Go to rockets full"  
Not responding  
"Hello Major Tom  
Are you receiving  
Turn the thrusters on  
We're standing by"  

There's no reply  

Four three two one  
Earth below us  
Drifting falling  
Floating weightless  
Calling calling home  

Across the stratosphere  
A final message  
"Give my wife my love"  
Then nothing more  

Far beneath the ship  
The world is mourning  
They don't realize  
He's alive  
No one understands  
But Major Tom sees  
"Now the light commands  
This is my home  
I'm coming home"  

Earth below us  
Drifting falling  
Floating weightless  
Coming coming home  

Earth below us  
Drifting falling  
Floating weightless  
Coming home
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Magic" by The Cars:

Summer it turns me upside down
Summer summer summer
It's like a merry go round
I see you under the midnight
All shackles and bows
High shoes with the cleats a-clickin'
A temperamental glow

Oh oh oh oh
You're magic
Oh oh oh oh
You're magic

Do you remember the nights
We'd stay in a lover's lane
And dance under the streetlights
We'd laugh and we'd sing

And you'd lean on me and whisper
Baby love the way you do
Oh it's magical magical
Oh it's magical magical

Summer summer summer
Mmm Ooh summer summer summer
Magic magic magic
See you see you
Oh magic

Chick-a-bow chick-a-bow chick-a-bow
Oh oh oh oh
Magic
Chick-a-bow chick-a-bow chick-a-bow
Oh oh oh oh
Magic

Oh oh oh oh

Verse 1:
Diamonds at your feet
Walking all over me
Heartache it's in the air
You don't have to play fair
Leaving messages on the phone
I'm left in the danger zone
I can't believe the words you say
But I can't look away

Chorus:
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me

Verse 2:
You can put the blame on love
You can put the blame on me
You can say the words without a sound
You can turn my whole world upside down
I can feel the magic in your touch
I can feel you calling out in the night
But I can't look back
I just close my eyes

Chorus:
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me

B-Side:
You can live your life without a net
There's nothing that you can't do
You can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black

Chorus:
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me

Outro:
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me

Heavenly Father watching us all
We take from each other and give nothing at all

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this


Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you


How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold So cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry


Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride


How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold World so cold
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry


How can you just leave me
How can you just leave me
Baby how can you just leave me
Just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold A world that's so cold 


Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Outro:

Been working so hard

Eight hours for what
Oh tell me what I got
I've got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Now I gotta cut loose footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please Louise pull me off of my knees
Jack get back come on before we crack
Lose your blues everybody cut footloose

You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Deep way down in your heart
You're burning yearning for the
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You'll get by if you'd only
Cut loose footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes

Whoah Milo come on come on let's go
Lose your blues everybody cut footloose

Footloose footloose

And put your feet on the ground
Gotta take the hold of all

Lose your blues everybody cut footloose

I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby I could use just a little help

Can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes my hair my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
 baby I just know that there is

Can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight

I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on baby give me just one look

Can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey baby
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick  
And think of you  
Caught up in circles confusion -  
Is nothing new  
Flashback - warm nights -  
Almost left behind  
Suitcases of memories  
Time after -  
Sometimes you picture me -  
I'm walking too far ahead  
You're calling to me I can't hear  
What you've said -  
Then you say - go slow -  
I fall behind -  
The second hand unwinds  

If you're lost you can look - and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting  
Time after time  

After my picture fades and darkness has  
Turned to gray  
Watching through windows - you're wondering  
If I'm OK  
Secrets stolen from deep inside  
The drum beats out of time -  

If you're lost you can look - and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting  
Time after time  

You said :  
Go slow - I fall behind  
The second hand unwinds  
If you're lost you can look - and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting  
Time after time  
If you're lost you can look - and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting  
Time after time

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "She Bop" by Cyndi Lauper:


I've seen 'em come and go
I've seen 'em die for rock and roll
I've seen 'em put it to the limit
I've seen 'em crawl back for more


I've seen 'em ignore'n with their heads in the sand
I've seen 'em reeling from the thrill of romance
And I think I've seen just about everything
When I think I've seen it all
I hear my body callin' got to get a little more


She bop he bop and we bop
I bop you bop and they bop
Be bop be bop a-lu-she bop
I hope He will understand


I witnessed hungry people
Who lost everything they got
I witnessed a perfect couple
Whose solution was to tie the knot


I've seen 'em ignore'n with their heads in the sand
I've seen 'em reeling from the thrill of romance
And I think I've seen just about everything
When I think I've seen it all
I hear my body callin' got to get a little more


She bop he bop and we bop
I bop you bop and they bop
Be bop be bop a-lu-she bop
I hope He will understand


I know you're thinkin' of me
'Cause it's as plain as day
I know you're thinkin' of me
'Cause every night I hear you say
"Your hair your hair reminds me of a time
When times were good and things were fine"
Oh she bop he bop and we bop
I bop you bop and they bop
Be bop be bop a-lu-she bop
Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong oh oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight
Who's gonna pick you up when you fall
Who's gonna hang it up when you call
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams
Who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong oh oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight
Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake
Who's gonna come around
When you break
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong oh oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight
She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all the heads turned because she was the queen
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name yeah
Ah and she said "I was the tiger she wanted to tame"

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

I was in search of a good time
Just running my game yeah
Love was the furthest furthest from my mind

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run


Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh her mind her body yeah yeah
They were mine for a night

Caribbean Queen

And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run run
No more love on the run run

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Infatuation" by Rod Stewart:


Early morning when I wake up
I look like Kiss but without the make-up
And that's a good line to take it to the bridge
And it's a fine time to tell you what I'm feeling


I'm infatuated by your moves baby
I'm infatuated by the way you roll
I'm infatuated by the things you do darlin'
Oh let me get down and dirty
Let me get down and dirty with you


I need a woman who can satisfy
Someone to take on a midnight ride
I need a lover who'll take me there
And I need your lovin' baby everywhere


I'm infatuated by your moves baby
I'm infatuated by the way you roll
I'm infatuated by the things you do darlin'
Oh let me get down and dirty
Let me get down and dirty with you


Come on girl you're looking so fine
And I admire the way you move your behind
It's just a matter of time
Before you let yourself go


I'm infatuated by your moves baby
I'm infatuated by the way you roll
I'm infatuated by the things you do darlin'
Oh let me get down and dirty
Let me get down and dirty with you


I'm infatuated by the things you do darlin'
Oh let me get down and dirty
Let me get down and dirty with you
VERSE 1:
I thought that dreams belonged to other men
'Cause each time I got close
They'd fall apart again
I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
I faced the nights alone
Oh how could I have known

CHORUS:
That all my life I only needed you
Oh almost paradise
How could we ask for more
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise

VERSE 2:
It seems like perfect love's so hard to find
I'd almost given up
You must have read my mind
And all these dreams I saved for a rainy day
They're finally comin' true
I'll share them all with you

Repeat Chorus

BRIDGE:
And if I ever lose this heaven
I'll die a satisfied man
I don't need no mansion in the valley
No flashy car that shines in the dark
No all I want is you beside me
And to hear your heart cry out
Woo-ooh-ooh woo-ooh-ooh

Repeat Chorus
Verse 1:
Feel the rhythm check the ride
Come on along and have a real good time
Like the days of stomping at the Savoy
Now we freak oh what a joy
Just come on down two worlds collide
Let's rock this joint and fill the floor all night

Chorus:
Breakin' breakin' there's no stoppin us
We're breakin' breakin' there's no stoppin us

Verse 2:
The music's pumpin' this rhythm's hot
The party's jumpin' we just can't stop
Let your hands clap your fingers pop
We're the boogie boys from the LA spot
Just freak a step and let your feet fly
Just come on down and make your move tonight

Chorus:
Breakin' breakin' there's no stoppin us
We're breakin' breakin' there's no stoppin us

Think of Laura
but laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way

When you think of Laura
say a prayer
and kiss your loved ones
goodbye

And go out and make a better world
for all the ones who've come before




Woah oh oh oh
For the longest time
Woah oh oh
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

Oh oh oh oh oh
For the longest time
Oh oh oh oh oh
For the longest

I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've come this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time

Woah oh oh oh oh
For the longest time
Woah oh oh oh oh
For the longest time
Woah oh oh oh oh
For the longest time
Woah oh oh oh oh
For the longest time
Woah oh oh oh oh
For the longest time
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Got a Hold on Me" by Christine McVie:

When I see you down the road
I'm thinking one thing that you ought to know
You're the one that's got a hold on me
Yes you are
I can't let go and I want you to know
That you're the one that's got a hold on me

Now every time I see your face
I get all bound up in my embrace
I'm the one that's got a hold on you
And I do
We can't let go and I want you to know
That I'm the one that's got a hold on you

I know you feel it too
This thing that we've begun
We've got it all before us
And it's only just begun

Now every time you call my name
I find myself wanting to explain
You're the one that's got a hold on me
Yes you are
I can't let go and I want you to know
That you're the one that's got a hold on me

I know you feel it too
This thing that we've begun
We've got it all before us
And it's only just begun

When I see you down the road
I'm thinking one thing that you ought to know
You're the one that's got a hold on me
Yes you are
I can't let go and I want you to know
That you're the one that's got a hold on me

We can't let go and I want you to know
That you're the one that's got a hold on me
If there's something strange in your neighborhood
Who you gonna call ghostbusters
If there's something weird and it don't look good
Who you gonna call ghostbusters
I ain't afraid of no ghost

Who can you call ghostbusters
An invisible man sleepin' in your bed

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you

So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do

Talk to me
Like lovers do

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion

So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me

I want to talk like lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Hard Habit to Break" by Chicago:

I guess I thought you'd be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what you've got until it's gone
And I found out just a little too late

I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
Doin' you a favor I hardly knew
I've come to know that I've been selfish
And all I thought was true

All begins to unravel when you say
We need to talk
And all I hear is the process repeating
It's a shock

I know I gotta let it go
But I got this feeling
It's gonna be a hard habit to break
I'm addicted to you
Baby you're a hard habit to break
You found someone else you had every reason
You know I can't blame you for runnin' to him
Two people together but living alone
I was just too selfish to understand

That all begins to unravel when you say
We need to talk
And all I hear is the process repeating
It's a shock

I know I gotta let it go
But I got this feeling
It's gonna be a hard habit to break
I'm addicted to you
Baby you're a hard habit to break

Why do you move me
You're so cold I can't believe
The ways that you wanna tease me
But I love the way you touch me
Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always always on my mind

I know I gotta let it go
But I got this feeling
It's gonna be a hard habit to break
I'm addicted to you
Baby you're a hard habit to break

I know I gotta let it go
But I got this feeling
It's gonna be a hard habit to break
I'm addicted to you
Baby you're a hard habit to break

I know I gotta let it go
But I got this feeling
It's gonna be a hard habit to break
I'm addicted to you
Baby you're a hard habit to break
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Automatic" by The Pointer Sisters:

Look what you're doin' to me
I'm utterly at your whim
All of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me
With its X-ray vision
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
winds up locked in the circuitry

CHORUS:
Your words buzz around my head
like flies in a busy room
And your body's still talkin' to me
But I don't know if I'm gettin' through
But I'm gonna keep trying
Till I break on through to the other side
I wanna be automatic
And take all the trouble outta lovin'

My engine's steamin'
The pistons're pumpin'
The gears're all grindin' clear
If you'd come in to my bay
Man you'd never go away
'Cause my little engine dear
is a-souped-up full-blown automatic
self-startin' mechanical man

And I'm mean mean machine
Got movin' parts got fuel-injection
And an all-night shine
Gonna keep movin' keep movin'
Just a little Engine That Could with a
With four-wheel drive And an overdrive
With a pow'r glide
Ooh ooh ooh
With a takin' it easy take-over any time Rockwell power drive

CHORUS

I'm talkin' automatic
No worries
Automatic
When you need it
Automatic
Push button and you got it all
Automatic
No sweat
Automatic
When you need it
Automatic
Digital display
Automatic
Love is here today
Automatic

Miss me blind
Miss me blind


Don't want to touch your skin don't want to taste your lips
I don't want a thing from you just stay away baby
Don't want to feel your heat don't want to know your charm
I don't want you in my arms 'round my place baby


Just Miss me blind
Miss me blind
Miss me blind
Miss me blind


All those times you stood by me
Through the thick and thin
You know damn well girl that you were my friend
Now This is the end of our love and affection
Now I'm cutting it off to see some new direction


Just Miss me blind
Miss me blind
Miss me blind
Miss me blind


Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes that's Cathy's clown
Let me go where I'll never be found
Don't want to see your face you're a waste of space
No more love no more pain no more tears no more shame
Miss me blind 
The shore's deserted brother  
The streets are dead  
The only surface noise is  
The hissing in my head  
Late at night the city  
Whispers secrets in my ear  
I'm haunted by the shadows  
Of a life that used to be  
Cover me  
Come on baby cover me  
Well I'm looking for a lover  
Who will come on in and cover me  
Promise me baby you won't let them  
Find us  
Hold me in your arms  
Let's let our love blind us  
Cover me  
Shelter me  
Oh cover me  
Well I'm looking for a lover  
Who will come on in and cover me  
Outside's the rain the driving snow  
I'll pull you close  
And never let you go  
I'll cover you  
Yeah come on  
Well now don't you  
Leave me alone  
I'm running to you baby  
You are the only one  
Who can close the door  
On this ugly storm  
Let me be your shelter  
Let me be your storm  
Can I have this dance  
Can I say please  
Don't you leave me alone  
Come on cover me
Verse 1:
Can't stop the music
You can try but you just can't
Can't stop the music
I hear the rhythm inside my head
Can't stop the music
Don't make me dance all by myself
Can't stop the music
The beat's alive and it shocks me
Like an electric ball

Chorus:
Breakdance breakdance
Breakdance breakdance
Break

Verse 2:
Can't stop the music
Can't stop the music
It's got a hold on me
Can't stop the music
Can't stop the music
It's like a dream
Can't stop the music
Can't stop the music
It's like an energy
Can't stop the music
Can't stop the music
It's what I need

Chorus:
Breakdance breakdance
Breakdance breakdance
Break

Bridge:
Get up get up get up
Gonna break it down and we just can't stop

Chorus:
Breakdance breakdance
Breakdance breakdance
Break

Outro:
Breakdance breakdance
Breakdance breakdance
You really want the uncensored version of "Church of the Poison Mind" by Culture Club Please note that the following lyrics may contain offensive language and mature content:

Desert loving in your eyes all the way
If I listened to your lies would you say
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go you come and go

Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
You come and go you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red gold and green red gold and green

Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling our love is strong
When you go you're gone forever
You string along you string along

Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
You come and go you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red gold and green red gold and green

Every day is like survival
You're my lover not my rival
Every day is like survival
You're my lover not my rival

Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
You come and go you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red gold and green red gold and green

Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
You come and go you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream
Red gold and green red gold and green
You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the Scylla and Charibdes
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger

I have only come here seekin' knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turned into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
But I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
And you will see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
Then you'll find your servant is your master

You'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger

You'll be wrapped around my finger
The dark side's callin' now
Nothin' is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows she walks like a dream
Makes me feel crazy makes me feel so mean

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
Slip to the dark side and cross that line
On the dark side oh yeah
On the dark side oh yeah

The dark side's callin' now
Nothin' is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows she walks like a dream
Makes me feel crazy makes me feel so mean

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
Slip to the dark side and cross that line
On the dark side oh yeah
On the dark side oh yeah

On the dark side on the dark side
On the dark side on the dark side
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Rock Me Tonite" by Billy Squier:

I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said "I've had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way"
I think that any love is good lovin'
So I took what I could get mmh
She looked at me with big brown eyes
And said "You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
You need somethin' to make you feel like new
You know she likes to dance in the dark
You know she likes to twirl and then run
You know she feels like magic
And you know she can't be tamed
She dances underneath the stars
And drives her car without a shame
She said "Hey listen baby
You can't go no further
That's it that's it
Here's something for your head your head"
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet
Here's something here's something that you're never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby you know you know you know you just ain't seen nothin' yet
You need a somethin' that's gonna make you feel like your brand new
That's it
Verse 1:
I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much

Chorus:
Oh you're wasting my time you're just just just wasting time
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels

Verse 2:
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart
Don't don't don't throw it away
throw it away throw it away
I made a fire and watching burn
Thought I had made you
I heard you crying out
"Don't break my heart my achy breaky heart"

Chorus:
Oh you're wasting my time you're just just just wasting time
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
ah ah

Bridge:
Ah don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't don't don't throw it away

Chorus:
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
ah ah
Don't close your heart to how you feel
Dream and don't be afraid the dream's not real
Close your eyes pretend it's just the two of us again
Make believe this moment's here to stay
Touch touch me the way you used to do
I know tonight could be all I'll have with you
From now on you'll be with someone else instead of me
So tonight let's build this memory
For the last time hold me now
Don't cry don't say a word just hold me now
And I will know though we're apart we'll always be together
Forever in love what do you say
When I'm with anyone else it's so hard to be myself
Only you can understand how I feel
I just wish that I didn't have to be so far away
So far away from you again
For the last time hold me now
Don't cry don't say a word just hold me now
And try to understand that I hope at last you've found
What you've been searching for
And though I won't be there anymore
I will always love you
Forever in love what do you say
For the last time hold me now
Don't cry don't say a word just hold me now
And I will know though we're apart we'll always be together
Forever in love what do you say forever in love
Forever in love what do you say forever in love
Forever in love what do you say forever in love

Who's watching
Tell me who's watching
Who's watching me


I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five hey hell I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone and


I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy woah-ooh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream


When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there woah


I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy woah-ooh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me


I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me
Well is the mailman watching me
And I don't feel safe anymore oh what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now Who
The I can see him from the corner of My eye
Woh-oh ooh


I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy woah-ooh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me woah-ooh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

'Cause when I feel your gentle touch
And things are going our way
I wanna spill my love on you
All day and all night

You wanna give me kisses sweet
Only for one night with no repeat
But when I think of the love we could be making
I'm willing to wait for that long awaited taking

Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

Or else we'll be two worlds apart
With nothing but a broken heart
So give it up
Give it up

Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

With nothin' left to lose
Lay it on the line
Alright let's do it

Love is what I want from you
But there's nothin' that you wanna do
When we touch it just don't feel the same
But we both know that's a silly game

Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

Or else we'll be two worlds apart
With nothing but a broken heart
So give it up
Give it up

Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up

Baby give it up
Give it up
Baby give it up
Give it up
I'll be happy to fulfill your request; however please note that the lyrics contain explicit language


I'm all out of hope
One more bad dream could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release



Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face


I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face


When you hear the music you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas oh the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinkin' it down oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books tryin' to stay hip
I'm thinkin' of you you're out there so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers


Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once
So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Such a human waste your eyes without a face
And now it's getting worse

You must be my Lucky Star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are

Starlight star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight  little star
Starlight star bright first star I see tonight
Starlight  little star

I can't believe you are mine
I just want to be with you all the time
I don't need your money I don't need your car
And I don't need you baby if you're gonna be untrue



Lucky star lucky star
You must be my lucky lucky star



Lucky star lucky star
You must be my lucky lucky star
Lucky star lucky star
You must be my lucky lucky star
