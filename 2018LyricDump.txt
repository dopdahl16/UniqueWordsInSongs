I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in and follow my lead
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh I never knew you were the someone waiting for me


'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine


Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love to carry children of our own


We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand
Be my girl I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this darling you look perfect tonight


Oh no no no
Mm


Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
And she looks perfect tonight

Baby lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at


Who knows where this road is supposed to lead
We got nothin' but time
As long as you're right here next to me
Everything's gonna be alright


If it's meant to be it'll be it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be it'll be it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be it'll be it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be


I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie ain't gonna lie


'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me what you're made of
Boy make me believe


If it's meant to be it'll be it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be it'll be it'll be c'mon
Baby just let it be let's go
So won't you ride with me ride with me
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be it'll be it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be


So come on ride with me ride with me
See where this thing goes
So come on ride with me ride with me
Baby if it's meant to be


If it's meant to be it'll be it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be it'll be it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me ride with me

You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend

Thunder thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are
Dreaming 'bout being a big star

They say you're basic they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds


Thunder thunder
Thunder thun- thunder
Thun-thun-thunder thunder thunder
Thunder thun- thunder
Thun-thun-thunder thunder


I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder thunder

He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you"

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling it's vulturous
Negative nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run I was born for this

Whip whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up

I wanna be the slip slip
Word upon your lip lip
Letter that you rip rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run I was born for this

Whip whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up

I wanna be the slip slip
Word upon your lip lip
Letter that you rip rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see

I'm just a product of the system a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee

I do what it takes
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Zaytoven


Ric Flair drip go "woo" on a bitch
Drip drip ooh the price of fame is just ice
My chain and my teeth insane I'mma need me a sane
Took her out of the Hills 'cause her eyes low but she lives a plane
yah


I spend my loneliness Loneliness bitch I feel showered in gold
My neck a bird aviary Aviary just a cooler nothin' ordinary
I'm takin' her back to my village Back to the village the nana wanna fuck on the guys
She want a few guys heard you want someone that's charming and fly that's what she said
I'm in my mode trapped with the stars like I'm Tony Parker
I'm ballin' on you like I'm comin' off of free throws swish
Just need someone that's vibin' with me someone that's conscious and spirited
One-on-one with the truth cause sometimes the lies can bury it
Been awhile since I spoke from the heart a soul searchin' expedition

She told me that I'm not enough yeah 
And she left me with a broken heart yeah 
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault yeah 
She cut too deep now she left me scarred yeah 


Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain yeah 
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine yeah 
I fall apart down to my core 
I fall apart down to my core 
Didn't know it before 
Surprised when you caught me off guard 
All this damn jewelry I bought 
You was my shorty I thought 


Never caught a feelin' this hard 
Harder than the liquor I pour 
Tell me you don't want me no more 
But I can't let go 
Everybody told me so 
Feelin' like I sold my soul 
Devil in the form of a whore 
Devil in the form of a whore 


You said it 
No you said it 
No you said it 
We'd be together 
Oh yeah 

I fall apart 
Down to my core 
Ooh didn't know it before 
Surprised when you caught me off guard 
All this damn jewelry I bought 
You was my shorty I thought

I'm always ready for a war again  
Go down that road again  
It's all the same  
I'm always ready to take a life again  
You know I'll ride again  
It's all the same ooh ooh ooh  
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself  
When this life is all I know  
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell  
Without you I'm all alone  


Who gon' pray for me  
Take my pain for me  
Save my soul for me  
'Cause I'm alone you see  
If I'm gon' die for you  
If I'm gon' kill for you  
Then I spilled this blood for you hey  


I fight the world I fight you I fight myself  
I fight God just tell me how many burials left  
I fight pain and hurricanes today I wept  
I'm tryna fight back tears flood on my doorsteps  
Life a livin' hell puddles of blood in the streets  
Shooters on top of the building government aid ain't relief  
Earthquake the body drop the ground breaks  
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface  
Who need a hero hero  
You need a hero look in the mirror there go your hero  
Who on the front lines at ground zero hero  
My heart don't skip a beat even when hard times bumps the needle  
Mass destruction and mass corruption  
The souls are sufferin' men  
Clutchin' on deaf ears again rapture is comin'  
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good  
Then that's what it gotta be  


Who gon' pray for me  
Take my pain for me  
Save my soul for me  
'Cause I'm alone you see  
If I'm gon' die for you  
If I'm gon' kill for you  
Then I spilled this blood for you hey  


Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey

Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
Feeling 'bout you


And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do even though I do


You could break my heart in two
But when it heals it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true


Won't lie I'd go back to you
You know my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight but what's the use
I know I'd go back to you


And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do even though I do


You could break my heart in two
But when it heals it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true


All the words that I let unsaid
All the times it slipped from my hands
I should've put it all on you
'Cause you're the one I want

But every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it yeah
Even though I do even though I do


You could break my heart in two

Different colored chains think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin' man know the crackers wish it was a noose

To win the retreat we all in too deep
P-p-playin' for keeps don't play us for weak someone said
To win the retreat we all in too deep
P-p-playin' for keeps don't play us for weak yeah
This shit way too formal y'all know I don’t follow suit

All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my esés I need the booch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her "hop in you comin' too"
In the 305 bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
Don't stop pop that pussy
Had to slop the top off it's just a roof uh
She said "where we goin'" I said "the moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean it's just the pool
Now I got her open it's just the Goose

Someone said playin' for keeps
Someone said motherfuck what someone said
Don't play us for weak

Cross my heart hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
He said "be true" I swear I'll try
In the end it's him and I
He's out his head I'm out my mind
We got that love the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end it's him and I

We burn so bright
That shine down on the city at night
I swear you're like a a work of art
Ohh my god gotta have you uh

Walks through Asgard walks through Midgard
Walks through helheim just to make my heart
See his face in every single star
Ohh my god baby baby don't you see
Hip hop and Hennessey
A little enemies we'll turn to frenemies
It's all part of his legacy
Don't tell me "have a seat" no no

I'm in love with him and I feel fine
In the end it's him and I ah
In the end it's him and I

Cross my heart hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie I love you baby
He said "be true" I swear I'll try
In the end it's him and I
He's out his head I'm out my mind
We got that love the crazy kind
Feelings like this can't be denied
In the end it's him and I ah

Him and I
In the end it's him and I ah
Him and I

Keep telling me that it gets better does it ever

Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't it isn't in my blood

Love let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for
Or do the feeling haunt you
I know the feeling haunt you


Look at your man now look at me

We ain't 'posed to see
You and me meant to be
Ain't no other way to interpret it
Lauren Hill and Lauryn Hill of it ain't nobody that's more talented
We're both laughing it's all funny
The vow and the love we're through with it
Then cry and then cry and be professional
We'll both get dressed and pose for the ritual
And we'll go out separate ways
And try your hardest to regenerate
Or Will Smith the tears or
Heck maybe cry a river
Treat me like a whipping post
Even in moments when I lose my composure
Even when I'm at my worst I'm a blessed man
I take it to church like a usher I'm a seraphic server
I'm a chef I'm a servant


Love let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for
Or do the feeling haunt you
I know the feeling haunt you


Skin covered in ego
Get to talking like ya involved like a rebound
No control no off switch in the way that you bringing me down
It's a turn on get it away from me
Know you mean wrong keep away from me
And it's all wrong get it away from me yeah
I just cry for no reason I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life we were runnin' out of time


Love let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for
Or do the feeling haunt you
I know the feeling haunt you


Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I never can be
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I never can be
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I never can be
Maybe I wasn't there


Love let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for
Or do the feeling haunt you
I know the feeling haunt you

You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me the less that I cry
And every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out the less I love you
Baby we don't stand a chance it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes I'm way too good at goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes I'm way too good at goodbyes
No way that you'll see me cry No way that you'll see me cry
I'm way too good at goodbyes I'm way too good at goodbyes

I know you're thinking I'm heartless
I know you're thinking I'm cold
I'm just protecting my innocence
I'm just protecting my soul

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me the less that I cry
And every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out the less I love you
Baby we don't stand a chance it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes I'm way too good at goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes I'm way too good at goodbyes
No way that you'll see me cry No way that you'll see me cry
I'm way too good at goodbyes I'm way too good at goodbyes

No I'm way too good at goodbyes
No no no no no I'm way too good at goodbyes
No I'm way too good at goodbyes
No no no I'm way too good at goodbyes

I'm way too good at goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes

I'm way too good at goodbyes

I'm way too good at goodbyes
Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar
Damn love or lust
Damn all of us
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody no one to outrun me
Another world premiere
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly feelin' lovely livin' lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you ayy I wanna be with
I wanna be with you ayy I wanna be with
I wanna be with you ayy I wanna be with
Love me just leave me alone used to be sociable
Now I'm antisocial yeah
And I know how to grip a Magnum when I'm choking yeah
I'm sipping syrup 'til I'm ghost and I'm ghost
I'm tipping off like I'm Orville damn
I'm pushing poison they can't ignore you
I been ballin' like I'm on a floor and
My accountant say you need to bounce back
I got a bounce back machine my accountant say a number's too big
I got a green backpack with like 20 racks inside
I'm on the right track I'mma get at that
And I put that on everything like cap
From Rags to riches yeah
I been swervin' through greats and central
Only way to make big change is through education
The only thing that separated me from slaves is a chain
I'm like "Bad Medulla oblongata"
What would you do for the love Yeah we way too different for the
What would you do for the love of it Ayy yeah смоки

Chorus: Zacari
Knew it all along I been feeling it
All our karma has become our comeuppance
I don't wanna do it wrong
Can we keep keep each other company
Maybe we can be be each other's company
Oh company yeah yeah yeah
Oh company oh keep me oh keep me
Oh company oh yeah yeah yeah

Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar
This is food for thought switch the kitchen up
and bring a lot of vision to life
And I knew it cost living fast where it's all about the money bag
But slow it down a little stubborn 'cause I never waited for you
Pump your brakes a little this minute ooh
But I ain't finished yet no
Wait a minute ooh
You see you will never know
I got my head on tight some type of way
Thinking like is there any more love
Where you come from baby
And can I get some
Feeling like it's too hard to fall in love
This type of *can't say* too rough
Don't say too much I'm feeling way too out of touch
Live life up and down but he is up on us
And I told him "If you don't love me die" I told him "If you-" "I die"
If you don't love me die "And when I'm tired of putting fires out
I wanna give up and I wanna give in"
When you're running on fumes and I feel like a person can run forever huh
If you're running on love it's alright to be a sprinter then huh
More than a feeling it's a vision baby keep your focus
You don't wanna say you're in love off of the mere basis
Open up we can do it all night we can just-

Chorus: Zacari
Knew it all along I been feeling it
All our karma has become our comeuppance
I don't wanna do it wrong
Can we keep keep each other company
Maybe we can be be each other's company
Oh company yeah
Oh company oh keep me oh keep me
Oh company oh yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah go go away

If you can't relate party's over I'm killin' niggas sorry for it
Don't have to do it often it's all in good spirit
Twenty racks a tab my roof look like a show got racks
Got racks on racks got racks on racks
And that's a fact on fact I ain't spinnin' no racks
I'm bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her "hop in you comin' too"
In the 305 bitches treat me like I'm Unc'
Beto had to creole her told her "¡Ven aquí"
Yeah check the method they be askin' us questions harass and arrest us
Sayin' "we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh Y'all eat pieces of shit What's the basis
We ain't going no where but got suits and cases
Aye I'm tryna live a legend and be a bassist
Smoke a lot of herb need a therapist
My meteoric rise to my moments of crises
Brought me right here fuckin' with the likes of ya'
I mean woah
You boys' what careers on a steep slope
Mine on a hill theirs on a landfill
Lyrics real lyrics real hear me out
They shoutin' out debt but now they on my dick
Gaspar yanga in a wine glass
Hundred thousand dollars to my wrist sad
We runnin' the dance I co-founded this shit
And now I'm back boy I'm back boy
I'm at the crib with the phones off I'm off and rappin'
I don't even drink I should probably have an appletini
You know me always with it when I'm rappin' know me
Usually doin' 20 in a 30 I ain't in no hurry
Pussies takin' shots think they caught me slippin'
Damn that's a far cry from wavin' your hands front row at a Logic concert

Alright here are the uncensored lyrics of "How Long" by Charlie Puth:

Alright

Ooh yeah

I'll admit I was wrong what else can I say girl
Can't you blame my head and not my heart
I was drunk I was gone that don't make it right but
Promise there were no feelings involved

She said "Boy tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show" Yeah
She said "Save your apologies
Baby I just gotta know"

How long has this been goin' on
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately baby

I'll admit it's my fault but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once yeah
I try and I try but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love oh yeah

She said "Boy tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show" Yeah
She said "Save your apologies
Baby I just gotta know"

How long has this been goin' on
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately baby

Yeah yeah
I thought maybe you could love me
Now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait 'til the day
When you knock on my door

How long has this been goin' on how long

While you're callin' me "baby" while you're callin' me "baby"

On my heart where you're resting your head
And you just look so beautiful
It's like you were an angel
Can I stop the flow of time
Can I swim in your divine
'Cause I don't think I'd ever leave this place
Oh
Turn the lights turn the lights down low

Now I'm feeling you breathing slow oh
'Cause baby we're just reckless kids
Trying to find an island in the flood
Oh
Turn the lights turn the lights down low
And I will give you everything baby just let go
And my dreams unfold leave my nightmares cold
I just want to hold you close
But as long as you're near me
I'm gonna lose control oh oh

So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should

To just give up and run away
Oh I know we could find a love that's overlooked yeah
Don't you know we could be so good si
And when the night is young and we don't know what to do

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

Will do Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Natural" by Imagine Dragons:

Will you hold the line
When every one of them is giving up and giving in tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost tell me

Will the stars align
Will heaven step in Will it save us from our sin Will it
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey

And you're standing on the edge face up 'cause you're a

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah you're a natural

Will somebody let me see the light within the dark trees' shadows and
What's happenin'
Lookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin'
We are the youth
Call out to the beast not a word without the peace face it

A bit of the truth the truth
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey

And you're standing on the edge face up 'cause you're a
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah you're a natural

Deep inside me I'm fading to black I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand won't break it
I can taste it the end is upon us I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah you're a natural

Like a rainy Sunday morning makes me want to stay in bed
Twisted up all day long You're my inspiration girl you take me places Put the words right into these songs

Yes she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah I kinda freaked out we'd been friends for forever
And I always wondered if she felt the same way
When I got the invite I knew it was too late
And I thought damn she looks beautiful
And I wish I'd told her that she was beautiful
'Cause now she's with somebody else
Well me and her we don't get along
So every morning when I wake up
I sing my lonely song
Yeah I know it's a little bit dumb
But she's still the one
I I don't wanna get over her
I I don't wanna get over
I could be the one she wants someday
But right now it's just not that way
Cuz I love her like she's leaving
I I don't wanna get over her
I don't wanna get over her
Verse 1 - Khalid:
When I was young I fell in love
We used to hold hands man that was enough yeah
Then we grew up started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus yeah
Oh no your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said I'd be rich yeah
Hope that someday I'd make it out of here
But meanwhile I'm still sitting here

Pre-Chorus - Khalid:
Not in the middle not in the middle not in the middle
So we live in the cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty but we sure know how to run free
Living in the ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

Chorus - Halsey:
I'm on the east side you're a safe bet
We're a wooden heart when things get broken
Ooh
And you're my sky the only horizon
Ooh
We're running wild we're running high
Ooh

Verse 2 - Benny Blanco:
We used to believe
We used to believe in everythin'

Pre-Chorus - Khalid:
Not in the middle not in the middle not in the middle
So we live in the cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty but we sure know how to run free

Chorus - Halsey:
I'm on the east side you're a safe bet
We're a wooden heart when things get broken

And you're my sky the only horizon

Chorus - Halsey:
I'm on the east side you're a safe bet
We're a wooden heart when things get broken
Ooh
And you're my sky the only horizon
Ooh
We're running wild we're running high
Ooh
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name call out my name
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay want you to stay
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl why can't you wait Why can't you wait baby
Girl why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love
Won't you call out my name Call out my name

Girl call out my name and I'll be on my way

Lately I've been I've been thinking
I want you to be happier I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun

Every argument every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately I've been I've been thinking
I want you to be happier I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well that's eating me up inside
But we run our course we pretend that we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately I've been I've been thinking
I want you to be happier I want you to be happier

So I'll go I'll go
I will go go go

Lately I've been I've been thinking
I want you to be happier I want you to be happier

Even though I might not like this
But I think that you'll be happier I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately I've been I've been thinking
I want you to be happier I want you to be happier

So I'll go I'll go
I will go go go
Verse 1:
Talkin' to the mirror whispering your name
Just like you were here you'd think I was insane
I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you

Chorus:
It's just a simple song
Nothing real special about it
It's just a simple truth
I'm scared and I'm nothing without you

Verse 2:
I lose my concentration staring at your picture
I know I'm playing games but I need a little closure
I don't know what to say if you're even gonna answer me
But I'll keep on leaving messages until I hear you speak

Chorus:
It's just a simple song
Nothing real special about it
It's just a simple truth
I'm scared and I'm nothing without you

Bridge:
Just another phase I'm going through
Just another song I'm writing about you
Caught in between what's wrong or right
Don't wanna lose you but don't wanna waste your time

Chorus:
It's just a simple song
Nothing real special about it
It's just a simple truth
I'm scared and I'm nothing without you

Outro:
I'm scared and I'm nothing without you

Here today gone tomorrow
Don't know how to feel can't find my way so I'll follow
I just wanna make a way for my people to be happy
And even when we're gone and we're not around
I hope that they remember we were phenomenal
Hope that our lives made an impact
Hope that we're worth it and we fight back

Now lemme tell you why


It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on though the road's long
And seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
I-I wanna be there for you and I mean it when I say "forever"
I'm holding on holding on
And I'm holding on holding on
I just wanna know
I just wanna know how I can save you
How I can save you
How I can save you
But how can I save you
How can I save you


And I want you to be alive you don't gotta die

Say something I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
Anywhere I would've followed you
Say something I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all


And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would've followed you
Say something I'm giving up on you


And I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous then I'm through with you


I'm stumbled and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would've followed you
Say something I'm giving up on you


Say something I'm giving up on you

Hate seeing you with someone else don't want to be alone

Hear you calling on the phone I don't want to text no

My heart can't take this damage
And the way I feel can't stand it

Yeah I love the way you leave me / Breathless
I'm more than content with / This moment
Drowning in your deep end / We came up for air but / Only for a moment


Mercy why do you have to show up looking so good just to hurt me
Why do you make it so hard to be faithful with the lips of an angel
It's a curse and a blessing don't let me be misunderstood yeah
Mercy why do you have to keep me wanting more of you


Yeah we'll fall asleep whenever / We're restless
You know how to put me to / Bed but you won't let me
Get any sleep you keep / Leading me on with little glimpses of your body


Mercy why do you have to show up looking so good just to hurt me
Why do you make it so hard to be faithful with the lips of an angel
It's a curse and a blessing don't let me be misunderstood yeah
Mercy why do you have to keep me wanting more of you


I'm burning inside with my love for you
But the fire only fuels my desire for you


Mercy why do you have to show up looking so good just to hurt me
Why do you make it so hard to be faithful with the lips of an angel
It's a curse and a blessing don't let me be misunderstood yeah
Mercy why do you have to keep me wanting more of you

Are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep
Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times
Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines


Well if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

Whatcha' doing in fifteen minutes You wanna meet
I haven't left the house in days but I don't wanna miss your face
There's a neon light ablaze when you look at me
And the jukebox plays a song called "Feels Like Home" and it feels like home


If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

The one thing I'm wishing for
When the stars burn out and the tables turn
And a lesson learned I'll still be here
For you always forever

If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice I just wanna hear your voice

Oh I just wanna hear your voice
Oh I just wanna hear your voice

Got a boy back home in Michigan  
And it tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him  
So I told him that I never really liked his friends  
Now he's gone and he's calling me a ***** again  
There's a guy that lives in a garden state  
And he told me that we make it 'til we graduate  
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait  
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate  
I believe I believe I believe  
I believe that we're meant to be  
But jealousy jealousy jealousy  
Jealousy jealousy jealousy  
Get the best of me  
Look I don't mean to frustrate  
But I always make the same mistakes yeah  
I always make the same mistakes 'cause  
I'm bad at love ooh-ooh  
But you can't blame me for tryin'  
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'  
You were the one ooh-ooh  
That could finally fix me  
Lookin' at my history  
I'm bad at love  
Got a girl with California eyes  
And I thought that she could really be the one this time  
But I never got the chance to make her mine  
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines  
London girl with a attitude  
We never told no one but we look so cute  
Both got way better things to do  
But I always think about it when I'm ridin' through  
I believe I believe I believe  
I believe that I'm in too deep  
And jealousy jealousy jealousy  
Jealousy jealousy jealousy  
Get the best of me  
Look I don't mean to frustrate  
But I always make the same mistakes yeah  
I always make the same mistakes 'cause  
I'm bad at love ooh-ooh  
But you can't blame me for tryin'  
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'

That could finally fix me  
Lookin' at my history  
I'm bad at love ooh-ooh  
Oh you know you know you know  
I'm bad at love ooh-ooh  
I'm bad at love ooh-ooh  
I know you're afraid of the things I'm made of  
But I'm a freak I'm a ***** I'm a beast  
I don't care what you think  
I'm bad at love ooh-ooh  
But you can't blame me for tryin'  
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'  
You were the one ooh-ooh

All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out

Doing everything I can I don't wanna make you disappointed
It's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever did wasn't ever tryna make an issue for you but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong in the first place rightYeah I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down lookin' at the ground I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia what did I do wrong this time That's parents for you
Very loyal Shoulda had my back but you put a knife in it my hands are full
What else should I carry for you I cared for you but

I didn't even get to say goodbye
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh let you down


Don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Everytime I sit on that couch I feel like you lecture me
Eventually I bet that we could have made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out but I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool I checked out oh you wanna be friends now
Okay let's put my fake face on and pretend now sit around and talk about the good times
That didn't even happen I mean why are you laughing Must have missed that joke let me see if I can find a reaction
No but at least you're happy


Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh let you down


I'm sorry
I'm so sorry now
I'm sorry
That I let you down


Oh I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh let you down

Yeah sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Heaven" by Kane Brown:

 

Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go  
Saying how it's gonna be so good so beautiful  
Lying next to you in this bed with you I ain't convinced  
'Cause I don't know how I don't know how heaven heaven  
Could be better than this  

 

I swear you're an angel sent to this world  
What did I do right to deserve you girl  
I could stay here for eternity  
So go on and lay here with me  

 

Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go  
Saying how it's gonna be so good so beautiful  
Lying next to you in this bed with you I ain't convinced  
'Cause I don't know how I don't know how heaven heaven  
Could be better than this  

 

Could spend hours staring at your face  
Could spend hours figuring out how to erase  
All of your flaws but nothing would matter  
'Cause that's what makes you perfect  

 

Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go  
Saying how it's gonna be so good so beautiful  
Lying next to you in this bed with you I ain't convinced  
'Cause I don't know how I don't know how heaven heaven  
Could be better than this  

 

Could be better than this  
I swear this is perfect  
Come kiss me one more time

Verse 1:
Yeah
Be careful be careful be careful with me
Yeah look
I wanna get married like the Currys Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man I thought you would've learned a lesson
'Bout liking pictures not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine man I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you though trust me nigga it's cool though
Said that you was workin' but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas chillin' poolside livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide find a nigga
Fuck him suck his dick you would've been pissed
But that's not my MO I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
Don't make me pick sides I'm the shit baby and I know it
When I'm six-four ridin' on Lorenzos
Air to the floor I don't gotta know the score
Don't gotta know whose arms I land in
When I'm six-four ridin' on Lorenzos
Air to the floor I don't gotta know the score
Don't gotta know whose arms I land in

Chorus:
Be careful with me yeah it's not a threat it's a warnin'
Be careful with me yeah my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me careful with me careful with me
Always always always be careful with me

Verse 2:
Yeah it's not a threat it's a warnin'
I spent the bag on you I thought you would've been loyal
I'm glad that I didn't love you 'cause I knew you
Fuck around gettin' views while I'm gettin' money
Ironic you been sleepin' on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
You should luck up on me I'll be nice this time I won't bite
Gonna get a bag or a flight I could pop up on sight
I might drink a pint tonight I might fuck some shit up depending on how I feel
I'ma keepin' it real hundred girl I don't want no problems at home
But that ain't up to me you gon' do what you want
When you see a bad bitch comin' through yo' hood
What's good Fuckin' my baby daddy what's good
Huh pockets deep they duffel Bag Joe's
I ain't fuckin' with you niggas I'm off of your rolls
Ride around town till I leave
I gave you a chance but you fiendin' ain't no protectin' your neck
You know what's in store
I'm makin' a sandwich I'm talkin' about butter and bread
And a lot of that you know whaaat I'm sayin'

Chorus:
Be careful with me yeah it's not a threat it's a warnin'
Be careful with me yeah my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me careful with me ooh yeah
Careful with me careful with me ooh yeah

Outro:
Yeah look I wanna get married like the Currys Steph and Ayesha shit

Gave you TLC you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit

Met a man wearin' a T-shirt says "Virginia is for lovers"
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name"
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain


Get along on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try


Get along while we can always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall learn to dance
Call your mom buy a boat drink a beer sing a song
Make a friend can't we all get along


Get along on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try


We're all here the good and the bad
The happy and the sad
We're all tryin' to navigate through this thing called life
It's a long long ride


Get along on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try


Get along while we can always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall learn to dance
Call your mom buy a boat drink a beer sing a song
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Verse 1: J Balvin
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza
Ya empezamos cómo es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
La fiesta no para apenas comienza
Siguе bailando mami no pare

Verse 2: Willy William
Aquí se viene a bailar se viene a gozar
Mujeres no se queden sentadas que la pista las espera
Yo quiero ver quiero saber quien me llama
El que anda conmigo tranquilo la rompe
La fiesta es con nosotros los otros
Que esperen los turnos W

Chorus: J Balvin & Willy William
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando y se baila así
Mi gente no se detiene aquí nadie se quiere ir
Si el ritmo te lleva pues mueve la cabeza
Y sigue con el paso que combina con la fresca

Say it loud if you feel it la gente

Say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
