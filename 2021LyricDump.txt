If you wanna run away with me I know a galaxy
And I could take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time


I'ma put you in my car car
Buckle up and hit the gas fast
I can take it to your planet take it to your planet
Matter of fact take it 'cross the universe
Universe
I' ma make you my babe Ah
Every night I'll be in your sheets Skrrt skrrt
Staring at the stars girl with you beside me
I think it's beautiful the way you're stepping into the spotlight


I think it's time
Dancing F- while they shooting shooting
Stars above while we move moving
I think it's beautiful the way you're stepping into the spotlight


Can't deny the rhythm the truth
My hips don't lie it's you fool
I don't wanna lose this now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you baby it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along


It's like I'm levitating Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

The Milky Way we're renegading Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah-ah
Livin' in a world where nobody's innocent
Oh but at least we try
Gotta live my truth not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind
Baby yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye


I don't know why I run away Oh oh oh
I'll make you cry when I run away Oh oh oh


Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day


Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it I put you through hell


I don't know why I run away Oh oh yeah
Oh boy I'll make you cry when I run away Oh oh hey


Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day Oh yeah
Save your tears for another day Yeah


I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day ooh girl Ah
I said save your tears for another day yeah Ah


Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day Ooh yeah
Save your tears for another day Yeah


Save your tears for another day
Tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Tears for another day

I got my driver's license last week  
Just like we always talked about  
'Cause you were so excited for me  
To finally drive up to your house  
But today I drove through the suburbs  
Crying 'cause you weren't around  

And you're probably with that blonde girl  
Who always made me doubt  
She's so much older than me  
She's everything I'm insecure about  

Yeah today I drove through the suburbs  
'Cause how could I ever love someone else  

And I know we weren't perfect  
But I've never felt this way for no one  
And I just can't imagine  
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone  

Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me  
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street  

And all my friends are tired  
Of hearing how much I miss you but  
I kinda feel sorry for them  
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do yeah  

Today I drove through the suburbs  
And pictured I was driving home to you  
And I know we weren't perfect  
But I've never felt this way for no one oh  
And I just can't imagine  
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone  

I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me  
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street  

Red lights stop signs  
I still see your face in the white cars front yards  
Can't drive past the places we used to go to  
'Cause I still fuckin' love you babe ooh ooh ooh ooh  

Sidewalks we crossed  
I still hear your voice in the traffic we're laughing  
Over all the noise  
God I'm so blue know we're through  
But I still fuckin' love you babe ooh ooh ooh ooh  

I know we weren't perfect  
But I've never felt this way for no one  
And I just can't imagine  
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone  

'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me  
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street  

Yeah you said forever now I drive alone past your street

I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different hmm yeah

This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing off-key
But I don't wanna be alone and you know
That don't you

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Every time you come around you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin’ alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin’ this will be the last but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do


My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two it's trite it's trite


And now I'm drunk again 22 and I'm on the run again
I'm runnin' from somethin' that isn't there
I'm runnin' from somethin' I'm becomin' a nightmare yeah


My bad habits lead to late nights endin’ alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do


My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two it's trite it's trite


ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I think it's time I took a break ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Maybe we should all be grateful for mistakes ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to late nights endin’ alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won’t
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do


My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two it's trite

Sunshine sunshine make us in the shade
Sunshine sunshine make us in the shade


All I can do is sit back and watch
All of her trauma and all of her dramas
But I'm okay with it
Deep conversations and fresh fruit for breakfast
Take a little road trip because she deserves it
She said it made her feel like she was in a movie


Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes think about it's gonna make me sad
Gonna make me sad mm
Need someone to hold me this shit getting cold
Need someone to hold me it's so hard alone


I'm always on my own let me sink all alone
She said "Don't let them scare you you can't fail me before you try"
And when she's waiting for me
I'm running to the altar like a track star she's gonna love me
So I pick her from the airport


Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes think about it's gonna make me sad
Gonna make me sad mm
Need someone to hold me this shit getting cold
Need someone to hold me it's so hard alone


Out in the street cars drive by silently
Up in my seat mouth dry concrete
Hearts are so loud keep your coconut shells down
Mombies are prowling feathers are falling
Warriors in armor lined up and glowing
Crows to the left of me fall changing flowing


Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes think about it's gonna make me sad
Gonna make me sad mm
Need someone to hold me this shit getting cold
Need someone to hold me it's so hard alone


Sunshine sunshine make us in the shade
Sunshine sunshine make us in the shade

You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you No no no without you Ooh-ooh ooh
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like without you No no no without you Ooh-ooh ooh
I can't believe that you would've been leaving I've had enough of grieving
Guess I'ma just keep breathing Ah and moments turn to seasons Ah


And some things just don't change and that's the way it is
Always been the same same old shit in the day I pray and wish to make it new
Make it right all of the wrongs keep on going until the dawn
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do I give my heart and soul


You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you No no no without you Ooh-ooh ooh
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like without you No no no without you Ooh-ooh ooh
I can't believe that you would've been leaving I've had enough of grieving
Guess I'ma just keep breathing Ah and moments turn to seasons Ah


And some things just don't fade the way it is the way it's said
And some day you'll call me I'ma take it all back what I said
And I'd give all my love to have you here Ooh-ooh ooh
Cause it's so lonely in this bed without you
I know I hurt you I was so unkind
I was ungrateful I wasted your time
But I'll make it all okay swear on my life that I'll change


You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you No no no without you Ooh-ooh ooh
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like without you No no no without you Ooh-ooh ooh
I can't believe that you would've been leaving I've had enough of grieving
Guess I'ma just keep breathing Ah and moments turn to seasons Ah


And I know someday that it'll all turn around
Because all the fire I've been burning bridges down Ooh ooh-ooh
It's a lonely town but I survived


I'm still breathing Ah I'm still breathing Ah
I'm still breathing Ah I'm still breathing Ah
I'm alive Ah I'm alive Ah
I'm alive Ah I'm alive Ah


And oh I can't apologize for being honest
If it broke you down then I'm so sorry I'm so sorry baby
And oh I can't apologize for being honest
No no no no Ooh-ooh ooh
Verse 1:
A cold beer’s got twelve ounces
A good truck’s got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it’s gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

Chorus:
When the new wears off and they get to gettin’ old
Sooner or later time’s gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain’t seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

Verse 2:
FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fading out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting’s good

Chorus:
Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah sooner or later time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

Bridge:
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side

Chorus:
But heaven knows that that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
Verse 1:
What you know 'bout rollin' down in the deep
When your brain goes numb you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much put that shit in slow motion yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean ayy

Chorus:
What you know 'bout rollin' down in the deep

Yeah we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top too

Squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
Some Alabama jammin' she my Dixieland Delight

Fancy like  on a Saturday night
Full moon workin' on our suntan
Got the Jeep right yeah we're dancin' in the headlights
Side by side til' we're done done


City girl and a small town plate
Cinnamon twist on a vanilla shake
Been on a buzz ever since ya came around
I'm gonna drink it up if you don't put it down


Five dollar bill whole city's worth
Five ten fifteen twenty twenty-five thirty-five forty dollars worth
Get the pickle and the skillet gonna keep it in my pocket
Pourin' up and walkin' out homemade with an oven locket


Yeah we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top too
Two straws one check girl I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
Some Alabama jammin' she my Dixieland Delight
Ayy that's how we do how we do
Fancy like  on a Saturday night

Side by side til' we're done done

Verse 1: Saweetie
That's my best friend she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerk it she throw it out and come back in

Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't forgive myself for the nights that I left

Uh hold up

Uh let me add a little um-ting
I'm from Vallejo the city is campin'

They want the cookie but I'm not a Girl Scout
If you don't beat it up I'm gon' switch out

I be passin' the torch I be the last one they tell me it's a blessing

Feel like I be runnin' out of time I need someone to let me know

You're worth it oh you're worth it Runnin' out of time

Mmm ayy ayy

I wanna be the one but I know I ain't the only one One

Especially when they got a lovin' what I doin' way more than they love me More than they love me

Nowadays I get paid yeah

You know the bussdown gon' cost you ten Know the bussdown gon' cost you

I be focused on that cash can't get caught up in who beefin' with who

I be coolin' with gunners don't come through the hood without comin' Capalot

You know how I'm comin'

I'm with the right and the wrong I'ma get my respect in this song

They was lookin' for a while but I been been stackin' my cheese

I got right and I got wrongs but I'ma get my respect in these streets

You know that I been makin' noise mixin' Henny with the coke

I had left my baby stranded then she went and changed her clothes

I had to wipe that s**t away I threw some ice on her toes

For the 23 that's dead and gone I hold my money long

And I just spent three hundred racks on a Richard Mille ain't lose no sleep

My lil' broski just caught a body I'm like "Damn I hope he beat it"

And I got all this jewelry on me feel like I don't even need it

These diamonds real they see it they don't believe it They don't believe it

Got thirty thousand in my pocket I'm like "Why the f**k do I need a stylist"

I'm takin' off like a rocket she suck my d**k til she get lockjaw She suck my d**k til she get lockjaw

Throat goat I'm like "B***h come here you get tired of me"

She said "You sound like a safe I'm like "B***h are you tryna rob me" B***h are you tryna rob me

All these chains rest in peace to Harriet Tubman know she coulda freed more

I'm a certified Stepper you can't X me out like a Feni more

Yeah she got that wet s**t yeah that's a perfect demonstration

Make a movie with your b***h Steven Spielberg s**t

Got a condo up in Biscayne b***h now I don't got no patience

And I'm flyin' private to Vegas tryna hit a lick with the Asians I'm tryna hit a lick with the

Go where I wanna go I'm takin' over control Takin' over control

You like it tell me below I'm goin' over my goals Goin' over my goals

I was young and I was ambitious but tell me what I can't do

Got kicked out I was misfit but now the misfit that you can't move

Five years man this s**t been stressin' me and I can't rest

Got a little cousin that's a felon 'cause he been arrested

I be puttin' down on game hope my lil' brother get the message

I tried to keep 'em out them streets

But it ain't really much I can say I'm RAPPIN'

Verse 1:
Balloons are deflated guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed mm-hmm
Still got your things here they staring at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head just like the day that I met you the day I thought forever
Said that you love me but that'll last for never it's cold outside like when you walked away ahaha
I still remember the taste of your lips that night I've been reminiscin' oh

Hope life is good where you are

All these heartbreaks might've made me cold and
Cynical but I still
Run right back to you

Verse 2:
Friends all call me crazy
Guess they ain't seein' what I see

Drop a pin send a location
I'ma pull up in that bullet-coupe spaceship
Drop off a bag of some dangerous
I don't know what came over them people
Hit a switch on that boy now he hatin'
Started diggin' her back out she impatient
I don't miss I'm shootin' my shot like a Laker
I'm in that new Camelot blue and gray on them Dayton's
They want me gone but don't know why
It's too late gotta stay up I'm too fried
I won't let this pain go to waste
My bro was slain and it's hard to erase
His mama still callin' his phone
I know he not coming home I can't even look at his face
I put the Patek on my wrist and I flooded it out with the grace
I'm from the trenches where we had to rob just to get a plate
I was an outcast but I still made my business shake
If I take you out your glory you gotta back up out my space


He ain't mean it I'm at the bank goin' crazy
She gon' kill me if I take another trip the money daily
I'm tryna get back in that lil' bih it's been a while
And everytime I fuck I gotta hit that denim I love her style
You know Lil Marlo was my slime I'm just tryna keep it lit
Had a dream and ended up buyin' everything that I was missin'
I know you see me and I'm shinin' and it feel some way
Know some people hate that I'm on top I bulletproof the Wraith


Uh put respect on my name
Got racks on racks and none of them are the same
Ain't gotta add it up I ain't playin' with this change
I'm tryna put my name in stars Hall of Fame
I was in the trenches where everybody locked in a cage
Broke or dead gotta get up go chase a bag
I took a risk and went bought a Patek
I'm thinkin' God I ain't end up on a stretcher
Homicide be on my mind ain't no love inside this sector
I'm pourin' out a L for my niggas I'm pourin' up a dike on my bitch
I'm just tryna make her mine fuckin' her for hours 69
Lamborghini gray so she ain't never late 900 horsepower
They was tryna take my life they ain't know it was a shower
I just ran up twenty M's and I'm movin' like Obama in his prime


He ain't mean it I'm at the bank goin' crazy
She gon' kill me if I take another trip the money daily
I'm tryna get back in that lil' bih it's been a while
And everytime I fuck I gotta hit that denim I love her style
You know Lil Marlo was my slime I'm just tryna keep it lit
Had a dream and ended up buyin' everything that I was missin'
I know you see me and I'm shinin' and it feel some way
Know some people hate that I'm on top I bulletproof the Wraith

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself 
But you shoulda told me 
That you were thinking 'bout someone else 


You're drunk at a party 
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down 
Your phone's been off for a couple of months 
So you're calling me now 
I know you you're like this 
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it 
And like me I did 
But I ran out of every reason 


Now suddenly you're asking for it back 
Could you tell me where'd you get the nerve 
Yeah you could say you miss all that we had 
But I don't really care how bad it hurts 


You're drunk at a party 
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down 
Your phone's been off for a couple of months 
So you're calling me now 
I know you you're like this 
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it 
And like me I did 
But I ran out of every reason 


Now casually I'm in the corner with the boys 
Thinkin' about you smokin' and drinkin' 
On some balcony 
Acting like an adult 
Remembering when you changed my mind 


You're drunk at a party 
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down 
Your phone's been off for a couple of months 
So you're calling me now 
I know you you're like this 
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it 
And like me I did 
But I ran out of every reason 


Now I'm reminded that we're not meant to be 
Be seeing you everywhere 
But is it just me 
Oh will it ever be me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you


And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends
Now it sure as hell don't look like it


You betrayed me and I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat but you're still a traitor
Still a traitor


God I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way


You betrayed me 'cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
Will never feel sorry
For the way I hurt yeah
You talked to her You talked to her
When we were together loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter You did damn right
It took you two weeks It took you two weeks huh
To go off and date her Off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat but you're still But you're still 


A traitor Ah
Now you bring her to my spot
And you're actin' like it's new
And you're actin' like you're sorry
But I don't believe you
And I remember that night
When you left me in bed
Didn't give you a fight
But I guess that's what you wanted

Well the uncensored lyrics of "Starting Over" by Chris Stapleton are:

Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat  
To a better place than the one we're at  
And I ain't got no kinda plan  
But I've had all of this town I can stand  
And I got friends out on the coast  
We can jump in the water and see what floats  
We've been saving for a rainy day  
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

  
It don't matter to me where we are  
We can take the long way or take the boulevard  
I just wanna be where you're with me  
Baby we can start again fully loaded up in my Chevrolet  
We can also hit that exit out in front of us  
Cause baby the engine's warm if you're ready to run  
And I'm ready to run

  
My mama mapped out the road that she knows  
Which hands we shake and which hands we hold  
In my hand-me-down Chevrolet  
We can go whatever way the wind blows  
You ain't gotta be rich to be my girl  
You ain't gotta be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your

  
Kiss  
  
It don't matter to me where we are  
We can take the long way or take the boulevard  
I just wanna be where you're with me  
Baby we can start again oh yeah  
Baby we can start again woo  
So come on  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Bang" by AJR:


I get up I get down and I'm jumping around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang Bang Bang So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge still I'm not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinking it's time to go


Bum-bum-bum-bum come on

And I can't even lie I'd rather stay inside
I can't do society don't know how to be quiet
They keep talking I keep walking
And I'll never miss a beat I'm lightning
I get up they're gonna hate me now
'Cause I put up the walls and they're falling down
Bang Bang Bang And I'm knocking on the door but they won't let me out
I'm a liar a cheater a non-believer
I'm a popular popular monster


Bum-bum-bum-bum come on

A lot of things different doorways
I was wishin' that you could stay
Seasons change but we're still the same
I could go a thousand miles and never leave your side
You're lookin' at me like a shadow but baby we're not alone
I'm never gonna leave you baby nobody could
Nobody could ever love you better than the way I do


You and me like a fire tonight
We can both burn under the flickering light
I'm never gonna leave you you know it's true
Nobody could ever love you better than the way I do
Better than the way I do


I could buy you a diamond I could steal you a rose
We could chase down some sweetness but there ain't nothing sweeter than us
I could take you dancin' or I could watch you spin around
And I could never leave you no nobody could
Nobody could ever love you better than the way I do


You and me like a fire tonight
We can both burn under the flickering light
I'm never gonna leave you you know it's true
Nobody could ever love you better than the way I do


You and me like the lights in June
Ain't no glow like the moon baby
And this love is like a child born wild


You and me like a fire tonight
We can both burn under the flickering light
I'm never gonna leave you you know it's true
Nobody could ever love you better than the way I do
Better than the way I do

We're just two little specks in this great big world
Lost in the middle trying to find our way
We don't need no map just the two of us
And some trust in this brighter day


All I wanna do is go on and on and on and on chasing after you
All I wanna do is go on and on and on and on chasing after you


We're the best of friends we're the best of lovers
Two peas in a pod we're meant to be
We're running wild crazy like madmen
The world don't matter you and me just do


All I wanna do is go on and on and on and on chasing after you
All I wanna do is go on and on and on and on chasing after you


We're chasing dreams like they're the last bus home
It's a race we know we're gonna win
Nothing else can touch us we've got our own rhythm
Our love will chase on and on and on


All I wanna do is go on and on and on and on chasing after you
All I wanna do is go on and on and on and on chasing after you
All I wanna do is go on and on and on and on chasing after you
All I wanna do is go on and on and on and on chasing after you
Verse 1:
I've cheated and I've lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I've got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve for sure

Chorus:
Known to be crazy known to be wild
Mama had to suffer when I was a child
But when I'm gone I hope you see
I was the good one oh I was the good one

Verse 2:
I've got a past I won't erase
I've made mistakes I can't escape
But I'm good from my heart down to my bones
Might not be miss America
But I've got a beautiful soul
With an unbreakable bond
With God oh

Chorus:
Known to be crazy known to be wild
Mama had to suffer when I was a child
But when I'm gone I hope you see
I was the good one oh I was the good one

Bridge:
I wasn't always like this
No I wasn't always this strong
I used to let you dictate
How I would act and what I would say yeah


Chorus:
Known to be crazy known to be wild
Mama had to suffer when I was a child
But when I'm gone I hope you see
I was the good one oh I was the good one

Outro:
I did my best to be the best
And made mistakes along the way
But I was the good one yeah I was the good one

I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning yeah yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes eyes


Dancing on the edge 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed alone in the dark
I'm sorry gotta leave before you love me
Leave before you love me
Leave before you love me


I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long


I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't about to have no boo
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten it's crazy
I can't have what I want but neither can you


Dancing on the edge 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed alone in the dark
I'm sorry gotta leave before you love me
Leave before you love me
Leave before you love me
Verse 1:
Lookin' at the stars tonight I know that in the dark I'll find you're by my side
I know we were meant to be like a lock and its key
And we'll keep tumbling down like the leaves in the ground
Just know yeah know I'm glad

Chorus:
You exist you exist
I'm so glad you exist
I'm grateful for your existence
I'm so glad you exist

Verse 2:
Yeah it's a beautiful life don't wanna miss a moment with you by my side
Everyday I'm breathin' in air fillin' up my lungs just to be with you here
We'll keep tumbling down like the leaves in the ground
Just know yeah know I'm glad

Chorus:
You exist you exist
I'm so glad you exist
I'm grateful for your existence
I'm so glad you exist

Bridge:
I'll lift you up when you're feeling low I'll hold you close when you're feeling alone
Let me tell ya baby let me tell ya you're not alone

Chorus:
You exist you exist
I'm so glad you exist
I'm grateful for your existence
I'm so glad you exist

Outro:
You exist you exist
I'm so glad you exist
You exist you exist
I'm so glad you exist

Put your loving hand out baby
'Cause I'm beggin'


I'm beggin beggin you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin beggin you
So put your loving hand out darlin'


Ridin' high when I was king
Played it hard and fast 'cause I had everything
Walked away wonderin' then
How could I feel it's wrong lookin' down again


So I say
I'm beggin beggin you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin beggin you
So put your loving hand out darlin'


I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again


An empty shell
Used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hangin' over me
A broken man
That I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance


I'm beggin beggin you
Put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin beggin you
So put your loving hand out darlin'


I'm fightin' hard
To hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back
I'm just a con
About to fade to black


I'm beggin beggin you
Put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin beggin you
So put your loving hand out darlin'


I'm beggin beggin you
Put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin beggin you
So put your loving hand out darlin'

I got a lotta shit I wanna say off my chest ah

I'm losing my grip
I'm feeling like I'ma die before I live
All I see is murder murder my mind
Don't know where to turn don't know where to hide
Yeah and I'm all alone
Wishin' I was home with with you you you


I'm just tryna have a good time
Don't wanna let it die I'm tryin' to have a good night
Lookin' at my body I'm a motherfuckin' work of art
I shine bright I be lookin' like a superstar
And the music's just a beat for me to run into
And my heart what the fuck it gotta do
I ain't got a reason to be losing my ground
I ain't givin' up no I refuse to back down
And I see you playin' along like you need it too
Spray paint my name on the side of a train baby
Your one and only
Could break me babe uh
If you tryna leave then I can guarantee
That you won't make it far I'm a king


I've been goin' through some shit
I'm losing my grip
I'm feeling like I'ma die before I live
All I see is murder murder my mind
Don't know where to turn don't know where to hide
Yeah and I'm all alone
Wishin' I was home with with you you you


I'm a little stressed out
If you got a problem I don't fucking want your head now
Put your hands on me like we in that bedroom
Talkin' late night me spillin' out my issues
You look so good I could pitch you
And I'm hard make me wanna risk it all
I can't make you mine I just wanna waste your time
You can see it why you gotta act blind for
I ain't gonna miss you when you gone
I ain't gonna miss you no not at all
I can't keep up I keep fallin' down
I hate to see me like this I'm on the ground


I've been goin' through some shit
I'm losing my grip
I'm feeling like I'ma die before I live
All I see is murder murder my mind
Don't know where to turn don't know where to hide ooh
And I'm all alone ooh
Wishin' I was home with with you you you
With you you you with you you you
With you you you with you you you
With you you you with you you you
With you you you with you you you
With you you you with you you you
This is the uncensored lyrics of "What's Next" by Drake:


Astro yeah
Sun is down freezin' cold
That's how we already know winter's here
My dawg would prolly do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show him yeah
I tried to show him yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Gone on you with the pick and roll
Young LaFlame he in sicko mode


Woo made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside when they pull up they get me loose
Yeah Jump Out boys that's Nike boys hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big when we pull up give me the loot
Gimme the loot


Was off the Remy had to Papoose it for a hunnid a deuce
DC4
I'm too turnt when I shoot swear I won't miss
Christmastime don't miss backwood got the hiccups ooh
Mm-mm ooh
I'm at the stage it's lights cameras action
When I'm offstage no one'll know what's happenin'


Yeah yeah
I'ma put they face inside a pillowcase
Head shots tinted up I'm outside
Forgettin' all I shouldn't leave behind but it's alright
Huh huh
Pourin' drinks for all my soldiers
Just came home and I'm already bendin' over
Like "Henny down Henny down doin' shots ayy"
December baby I'll be gone 'til May
Gone 'til May I'll be gone 'til May

But I'll be back oh I'll be back
And it's makin' me crazy yeah
I've been ready way before the playa haters
I'ma make it whatever it take
Watch what you sayin'


 Aye aye


Locked in the trenches relax
Can't see shawty if it's tinted
I'm with the Winfrey I'm with the Stentons
I'm on the block like it's hot like it's rented
I see a opp like it's a Sunday
Drake you know that it's fake if it's comin' from me
This is the bed travelin' agents
I'm tryna get back to the office by Monday ayy


Then I'll be back in the stu'
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I'ma get this shit done for Yummy
Postin' 'round uppin' stakes and it's on sight
See the headlights Give me the big slice
I put my city on the map
You gotta bow every time every time you come back

Aye Mikiel
I just checked the dashboard and it's lookin' like we in a rush
Go go go go
Verse 1: Chris Young
I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Rutherford County our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home I've got some famous friends

Verse 2: Kane Brown
Yeah I do I've got a couple buddies I grew up with
They're living life like me but man they're just regular joes
We get together every now and then shoot the bull yeah we love to complain
About how busy we are and how there ain't no time to hang

Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown
Yeah but what we don't talk about is how many we count on
No we don't wanna jinx the juju we ain't ever gonna lose
We've got a tight we can't unwind
We're like a blue collar boys doin' fine we're like famous friends

Verse 3: Chris Young
I've got some famous friends I've got famous people I call my friends
They're in high rise buildings they've got office views and a few Mercedes-Benzes
But we still text and we still talk on the phone
When I go back to Tennessee I've got a famous friend or two yeah

Verse 4: Kane Brown
Yeah I got one on the West Coast one down in Nashville
Yeah I've got friends in high places and in low places they're everywhere in between
Yeah I've got some famous friends that I'm proud to say I knew when
They were just normal folks and getting by was a struggle back then

Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown
Yeah but what we don't talk about is how many we count on
No we don't wanna jinx the juju we ain't ever gonna lose
We've got a tight we can't unwind
We're like a blue collar boys doin' fine we're like famous friends

Bridge: Chris Young & Kane Brown
We go way back yeah we're rocking chairs on the front porch
And they don't care if I'm a little more Crosby or he's a little more Stills
But we're like a mix of both of those yeah we're own little deal
Yeah we're chalking up shots talking 'bout life and we're making plans

Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown
But what we don't talk about is how many we count on
No we don't wanna jinx the juju we ain't ever gonna lose
We've got a tight we can't unwind
We're like a blue collar boys doin' fine we're like famous friends

We're like famous friends

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need and I
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
All I want for Christmas is you

Oh all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
The one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you

All I want for Christmas is you baby repeat and fade

Ah
Grrt woo

Look him dead in his eyes every time I ride past

Sure below are the uncensored lyrics of "What's Your Country Song" by Thomas Rhett:

Crickets singing in the backwoods
Blowing that smoke out the exhaust
Two-lane nothing but time
Don't give a damn about the odometer
Got her hair hanging out the window
Got that wind blowing gold halo
We're country just look at us
How could we not fall in love

What's your Friday night song
Where's your truck parked at
Are you tailgate buzzed 
Or laid back in a lawn chair baby
Is your back porch light on
Do you let your hometown roots hang 
What's your rough cut beer gut 
10-point buck driveway truck
Yeah what's your country song

Riding around with your boys this summer
Wanna know what makes y'all hum brothers
Is it a cold beer is it a double shot 
Is it punching a clock or forgetting what day it is 
What's your Friday night song
Where's your truck parked at
Are you tailgate buzzed 
Or laid back in a lawn chair baby
Is your back porch light on
Do you let your hometown roots hang 
What's your rough cut beer gut
10-point buck driveway truck
Yeah what's your country song

What's your Friday night song 
Where's your truck parked at
Are you tailgate buzzed 
Or laid back in a lawn chair baby
Is your back porch light on
Do you let your hometown roots hang 
What's your rough cut beer gut
10-point buck driveway truck
Yeah what's your country song

Woke up messed up quarter to noon
F*** I'm late again don't need an excuse
Took too many shots last night
Got bills to pay but I'm drinkin' on a Tuesday


One too many drinks on a Friday night
And I'm wasted but I'm tryna make it's all right
Maybe I'll just stay here and drink
Drownin' in the memories of you and me tryna keep it together
But I'm fallin' apart fallin' apart


Scattered napkins and a lipstick trace
Smell of your perfume still fillin' up this place
Your voice is rattling 'round in my head
I don't wanna care but I still do yeah


One too many drinks on a Friday night
And I'm wasted but I'm tryna make it all right
Maybe I'll just stay here and drink
Drownin' in the memories of you and me tryna keep it together
But I'm fallin' apart fallin' apart


Yeah I'm fallin' apart fallin' apart
And I know you've moved on but I'm still in the dark
Oh nothin' hurts like losing when you know it's really gone


One too many drinks on a Friday night
And I'm wasted but I'm tryna make it all right
Maybe I'll just stay here and drink
Drownin' in the memories of you and me tryna keep it together
But I'm fallin' apart fallin' apart
Yeah I'm fallin' apart fallin' apart

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it carried it carried it home


I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please carry me carry me carry me home


I've spent all of the love I've saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game


Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ah-ah-ah
All I know all I know
Loving you is a losing game


I don't need your games game over
Get me off this roller coaster

I've spent all of the love I've saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game


Oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ah-ah-ah
All I know all I know
Loving you is a losing game


I've spent all of the love I've saved all of the love I've saved
We were always a losing game we were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade a losing game
I got addicted to a losing game

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh


Got a hundred-dollar bill in my pocket right now
Wishin' it was double but I'll make it work somehow

A little cash left we can blow it all today

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh

I probably wouldn't be showing up
Smelling like a rose on your front porch
If I didn't love you
I'd probably be blowing up your phone
Begging you to come back home
If I didn't love you
I'd probably be listening to sad songs
Wishing I could write one
All alone no one to call
It wouldn't be the same if I didn't love you at all


If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the walkin' into runnin'
Yeah if I didn't love you I'd be good by now


I'd be okay I wouldn't feel
Like I'm losing my mind a little bit of my soul every time
I didn't love you
I'd be out there dancin' like a fool
With some good time friends doing the things I used to
Before I didn't love you
Girl I tried I can't hide I can't fight what the truth is
No matter what I do it always leaves me to one conclusion


If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the walkin' into runnin'
Yeah if I didn't love you I'd be good by now


Oh oh oh
Woah woah woah woah

If I didn't love you
I'd be good by now
But I do so I'm not
I can't just turn it off
I try tell myself enough's enough
But when I hold you close
Can't deny what's in this us
Yeah if I didn't love you I'd be good by now


If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the walkin' into runnin'
Yeah if I didn't love you I'd be good by now

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Hell of a View" by Eric Church:

Riding through the back roads
Targeting the short rows
Rolling with the echo whatever way the wind blows
I'mma plant my heart in the dust and watch it grow
This is what it feels like when you're living in a gold mine

I can see the sun settin' on the back of a deer
It's been hair on a Harley and her lips on a beer
I'll wear the pain like a camouflage burnin' up my strength
I got a hell of a view oh the mountains and the sky never looked so blue
I got a hell of a view yeah it's all I wanna see all I wanna do
I got a hell of a view

Stoned on some back street
Out here living my best dreams
I saw a fella go under so I'm living life for my brother
Rolling with the gutter punks making deals with the rich kids
Dancing with the devil it's a hell of a time

I can see the sun settin' on the back of a deer
It's been hair on a Harley and her lips on a beer
I'll wear the pain like a camouflage burnin' up my strength
I got a hell of a view oh the mountains and the sky never looked so blue
I got a hell of a view yeah it's all I wanna see all I wanna do
I got a hell of a view

I got a hell of a view ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I got a hell of a view ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I got a hell of a view

I can see the world from the mountain tops
Yeah it's a hell of a view
Every night I take the stars and I roll 'em around in my hands
I got a hell of a view

I can see the sun settin' on the back of a deer
It's been hair on a Harley and her lips on a beer
I'll wear the pain like a camouflage burnin' up my strength
I got a hell of a view oh the mountains and the sky never looked so blue
I got a hell of a view yeah it's all I wanna see all I wanna do
I got a hell of a view

I got a hell of a view ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I got a hell of a view ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I got a hell of a view
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop  

Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling  

You will get a sentimental feeling  
When you hear  
Voices singing let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  

Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old-fashioned way  

You will get a sentimental feeling  
When you hear  
Voices singing let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly  

Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old-fashioned way

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true


Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do


Do you read my interviews
Or do you skip my avenue
When you said you were passing through
Was I even on your way
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know


When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
Wish it wasn't true


Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do


Do you read my interviews
Or do you skip my avenue
When you said you were passing through
Was I even on your way
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was telling you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know


When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
Wish it wasn't true

Downtown turn around heard the sound
Of your boots on the ground
Pick you up take you downtown
Wanna show you around
I'm feeling like a Monday but someday I'll be Saturday night
I can barely hear you speak over the band
I'm just trying to get your number right
CHORUS
You-oo-oo-oooo you're single Saturday night
Can't blame me for taking my time
I'm holding out for that single Saturday night
I I I'm holding out for that single Saturday night

Your friends are calling you a cab while you're trying to get me out the door
But I'm holdin' onto your hand it's getting harder to ignore
I'm feeling like a Monday but someday I'll be Saturday night
I'll be what you're looking for
Just give me a chance to prove you wrong
 CHORUS
You-oo-oo-oooo you're single Saturday night
Can't blame me for taking my time
I'm holding out for that single Saturday night
I I I'm holding out for that single Saturday night

Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa whoa oh oh

You-oo-oo-oooo you're single Saturday night
Can't blame me for taking my time
I'm holding out for that single Saturday night
I I I'm holding out for that single Saturday night

We're just swerving sippin' 'til we can't
Keep spinnin' this world we made
Yeah we're just some seniors skipping class
And we'll grow up someday but just not today
We're just some down-home boys making noise
With a little too much pride
We'll drink some beer talk about God Amen


Got my old guitar in the back of the truck
We're all pulling into Christian's farm
Got a call from him said "I got a keg of Bud
And a bunch of girls yeah ya'll come on"
It's just a back porch kinda night
But it's our church it's our truth it's our lies
Antique plow stars and headlights
Jesus saves and George Strait's life


We're just swerving sippin' 'til we can't
Keep spinnin' this world we made
Yeah we're just some seniors skipping class
And we'll grow up someday but just not today
We're just some down-home boys making noise
With a little too much pride
We'll drink some beer talk about God Amen


I'm a reverend's son and a rebel's daughter
Straight outta Sunday school Bible study
A devil on my back and a angel on my shoulder
Saying "Have a beer would you trust me"
If I tip my cup and spill out that bread
Hop on a cloud and drink with the Holy One instead
We're all flawed and we're all sinners
But He'll forgive us and let us in the big doors


We're just swerving sippin' 'til we can't
Keep spinnin' this world we made
Yeah we're just some seniors skipping class
And we'll grow up someday but just not today
We're just some down-home boys making noise
With a little too much pride
We'll drink some beer talk about God Amen


We turn our pains into gold
Yeah we plant our flag in the snow
We're all a little messed up and that's alright
But thank the Lord we've got tonight


We're just swerving sippin' 'til we can't
Keep spinnin' this world we made
Yeah we're just some seniors skipping class
And we'll grow up someday but just not today
We're just some down-home boys making noise
With a little too much pride
We'll drink some beer talk about God Amen

Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now


What if you had it all but nobody to call
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything but no one's listening
And that's just f***in' lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a s***
They criticized the things I did
As an idiot kid


What if you had it all but nobody to call
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything but no one's listening
And that's just f***in' lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely


I'm so lonely lonely
I'm so lonely lonely
I'm so lonely lonely
I'm so lonely lonely
Benny Blanco
Yeah


What if you had it all but nobody to call
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything but no one's listening
And that's just f***in' lonely
I'm so lonely
What if you had it all
Lonely nobody to call
Verse 1:
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Chorus:
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong but it's alright
The more things seem to change the more they stay the same
Oh don't you hesitate

Verse 2:
Girl put your records on tell me your favorite song
You go ahead let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead let your hair down

Chorus:
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid but it's alright
The more you stay the same the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange

Bridge:
Girl put your records on tell me your favorite song
You go ahead let your hair down
Girl put your records on tell me your favorite song
You go ahead let your hair down

Chorus:
Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead let your hair down
Oh you're gonna find yourself somewhere somehow

Outro:
Blue as the sky sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid but it's alright
The more you stay the same the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange
Girl put your records on tell me your favorite song
You go ahead let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead let your hair down
Girl put your records on tell me your favorite song
You go ahead let your hair down

How to know when it's love

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face


Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow


I'm beggin' for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
There was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow


I'm beggin' for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm beggin' for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that's my man


And I know you're runnin' and I know I made you the fugitive
You never needed permission you're gonna take it anyway
And I think you kinda like it
And you'll be my Charlie Manson
I'll be your Harriet Tubman
I love you smack-dab in the middle of my dumbness


I'm beggin' for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
There was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow


I'm beggin' for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm beggin' for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans that's my man


That's my man
Yeah that's my man
And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
Oh oh oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well

Don't need Hennessy you're right here
Baby be

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through I'ma make it come over won't hesitate

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through I'ma make it come over won't hesitate

Everything I said you know I meant that
Pull up on the scene I got a coupe on the set
Real thick all fire when the mood in the text

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Whoopty" by CJ:


I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends no
God told me fend for self
I don't really trust no one


Switchin' the lanes it's a Porsche huh
Hunnid' on the dash get me close huh
Been a criss-cross through the north huh
Shorty gettin' Boris 'cause she know Zha
Boppers on the block and they comin' for socks
You n***** in the Bronx know me
Pullin' out the coupe out the lot
Told 'em f*** 12 f*** SWAT
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box mmh
Pour up the whole dan' seal I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo-deals we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a mic' in the cold
I hope that lil' b*** don't catch me
Givin' out smoke in the booth
The way they be movin' it's like they the uno


I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends no
God told me fend for self
I don't really trust no one


I know they prayin' that I flop
I remember back then I was broke
Now I'm living rent-free
Sip the Ace when it's cold
I ain't have nothin' for real
And when I'm in it got control hm
Shorty said I'm kawaii
Hit her once now I got the glow huh
All summer sixteen had to load it and go
But it's really gettin' scary drop a little song n***** be talkin' like they'll get you
Never met a real rockstar this ain't no guitar b***
Ayy baby where the f*** is your mans
I'ma sore thumb I'm the one that they envy like ayy
Snipe I pull up and hype
I ain't come here to make friends
I came to make a point and f*** her like Kobe
Damn these n***** either goin' or they owe me


I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends no
God told me fend for self
I don't really trust no one
