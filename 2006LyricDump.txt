Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way offline
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Ooh a holiday
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong
So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You see what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

They don't know what they're talking about
Let's keep on moving on keep on moving on

Is that the truth
Uh huh I said it
Is that the truth
Uh huh I said it

My life is brilliant  
My love is pure  
I saw an angel  
Of that I'm sure  

She smiled at me on the subway  
She was with another man  
But I won't lose no sleep on that  
'Cause I've got a plan  

You're beautiful  
You're beautiful  
You're beautiful it's true  
I saw your face in a crowded place  
And I don't know what to do  
'Cause I'll never be with you  

Yeah she caught my eye  
As we walked on by  
She could see from my face that I was  
Flying high f***ed up sorry but that's the uncensored version  

And I don't think that I'll see her again  
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end  

You're beautiful  
You're beautiful  
You're beautiful it's true  
I saw your face in a crowded place  
And I don't know what to do  
'Cause I'll never be with you  

La la la la la  
You're beautiful  
You're beautiful  
You're beautiful it's true  
There must be an angel with a smile on her face  
When she thought up that I should be with you  

But it's time to face the truth  
I will never be with you
Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting no fighting
We got the refugees up in here
No fighting no fighting

She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama Bonita mi casa su casa
Shakira Shakira

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction the tension
Don't you see baby this is perfection

Hey Girl I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body girl
And everything so unexpected the way you right and left it

So you can keep on shaking it
I knew I had to get you to my world
But you're so busy minding everyone else's business
Before I left I gave you my name and number

Come on and meet me in the pouring rain
We'll make another memory
I can feel you're on the way
I can feel the rhythm of your heartbeat

La música tiembla
La noche es de adrenalina
Llevo tiempo inquietando
Porque es que eres mi asesina

Y bailando gozando tu cuerpo el flamenco olé
Una locura mi salvación tu cintura
Que mueve de lado a lado

But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now fail now
See I am doing what I can but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche

No fighting no fighting
I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind

There was something so pleasant about that place

Even your emotions had an echo

In so much space

And when you're out there

Without care

Yeah I was out of touch

But it wasn't because I didn't know enough

I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy

Does that make me crazy

Does that make me crazy

Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life

But think twice that's my only advice

Ha ha ha bless your soul

You really think you're in control

Well I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy

Just like me

My heroes had the heart

To lose their lives out on a limb

And all I remember

Is thinking I want to be like them

Ever since I was little

Ever since I was little

It looked like fun

And it's no coincidence I've come

And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy

Maybe you're crazy

Maybe we're crazy

Probably

Police think they can see me lean

When you see me ride by they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ride with a new chick she like hold up
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip and my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone ain't tryna have no babies
Rock clean itself so I pull in ladies
Laws of patrolling you know they hate me


Music turned up and I'm tippin' slow
Twistin' lanes whip still glidin' good
I'm in your hood and my trunk bumpin'
Workin' my wood I'm choppin' on somethin'
Choppin' on somethin' I'm bobbin' my head
Take the turn too quick and my down piece drag
Back up off a my homie and watch me bake
Watch 'em bake after they catch me ridin' dirty

Got detectives ridin' with me they all undercover
And I'm paranoid of all these flashing lights
Paranoid of all these flashing lights
I'm hopin' that they ain't tryna take my life
Hopin' that they ain't tryna take my life

Madness with a pistol kinda close by me
Hopeful ly they don't get to decode my ID

*Chorus*

*Verse 2: Paul Wall*
I got a grill I call penny candy
You know what that means it look like Now and Laters
I got a grill I call iced out you see dem rocks in my mouth
I'm coming straight out the cut the slums of the South
I'm still in the hood and all the above
I'm in the Benz hollering "at" doing it real big
Fighting over rings and all the above
These hoes getting mad cause they can't get a man
Attracted to the shine of my grill
I pull up in Escalades and Impalas and "facet" on my grill
I might be grilled up with nothing but diamonds in my mouth
Plain jane ain't tailored but I'm fit like a Ralph
Lauren was born in this year you know what I'm talking about
The south-side is mine the westside is mine
The northside is mine and the eastside is mine
I don't care what you say I'ma keep my grill tight
And while you lying talking bout your ice mine shine brighter see

*Chorus*
Grillz on my teeth
Grillz on my teeth
Grillz on my teeth
Grillz on my teeth

*Verse 3: Ali & Gipp*
Got thirty down at the bottom thirty more at the top
All invisible set with little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price lets say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold traditional gold
I'm changing grillz like Jay changed clothes
I went from 4 to 6 to 8 to a whole lot
Got a safe at the bank so I'm never alone
Got a house with a yard I'm the only one on it
With a garage for the six four Impalas
The street wear the Panthers with gold in they mouth
Groupies at the shows just to watch us per-fume the crowd
Escalade the truck with the fish tank and the chrome wheels
I'm from the south souf  we grill we'll grin and jack golds
I ain't slept yet people still calling me the late show
I'm a candy-painted lover sitting sideways
Tip and Ash it's on the drop nine in my hand
Ice in my grill shining just like a chandelier

*Chorus*
Grillz on my teeth
Grillz on my teeth
Grillz on my teeth
Grillz on my teeth
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill

Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Grillz grillz grillz grillz grillz grillz
Ya'll know what it is

I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth


But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears


And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind she's on your mind


Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
To say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along


But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between


And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind she's on your mind


Everyone knows
Everyone knows
Everyone knows
Everyone knows


And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind she's on your


Everyone knows
Everyone knows

And I know it makes no sense
Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore it's ridiculous

It's been months
And for some reason I just
can't get over us
And I'm stronger than this
enough is enough
No more walkin round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio

Gotta fix that calender I had
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio

Leave me alone Leave me alone
Stupid love songs Dumb stupid love songs
Don't make me think about her smile Or having my first child
I'm letting go Turning off the radio

'cause I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio
Why can't I turn off the radio
Ahem Okay here you go:


Meet me in the trap it's goin' down 
Meet me in the mall it's goin' down 
Meet me in the club it's goin' down 
Anywhere you meet me guaranteed to go down 


Catch me in the hood it's goin' down 
Catch me in the 'burbs it's goin' down 
Catch me on a cruise it's goin' down 
Anywhere we meet guaranteed to go down 


We can go to the bank it's goin' down 
We can go to the strip club it's goin' down 
Everywhere you meet me it's goin' down 
Don't believe me just watch it go down 


Let me see you get low you scared you scared 
Drop it like it's hot get down get down 
Let me see you get low you scared you scared 
Drop it like it's hot get down get down 


Break it down back it up 
Fuck it up fuck it up back it up 
Break it down back it up

If you're lookin' for me I'm in the ATL 
Where's it's sunny and the girls are real 
All I need is a beat from the song I'ma spill this 
Sittin' high still ridin' on my big wheels 


So what you talkin' 'bout we gettin' money 
Y'all ain't got nothin' for me 
I'm from the 'hood it's cool I follow the rules 
And obey the laws just like I'm supposed to 


I hit the mall deep with the 20 stacks 
And drop it on this shoe game homie that's where it's at 
I gave you a sack then you holla at me 
I'm watchin' my money don't make me catch a body 


That's for the trap that's for the hood 
That's for the block that's understood 
When you see me know I'm good 
But anyway let's toast the good life 


Champagne spilling hoes comin' over 
And when the money out the chicks will leave you 
You're ambition kinda small don't try to hold us down 
We never fallin' off guaranteed to go down 


We can go to the bank it's goin' down 
We can go to the strip club it's goin' down 
Everywhere you meet me it's goin' down 
Don't believe me just watch it go down 


Let me see you get low you scared you scared 
Drop it like it's hot get down get down 
Let me see you get low you scared you scared 
Drop it like it's hot get down get down 


Break it down back it up 
Fuck it up fuck it up back it up 
Break it down back it up 
Fuck it up fuck it up back it up 


It's goin' down no matter what I'ma keep it real 
Everything I got everything I do 
And I ain't gotta say nothin' you already know 
When you're lookin' at me man damn already ooh 


Too late can't stop won't stop 
Feel like I'm on the top guess I'm on the top 
Let's do it again baby we gon' do it again 
Ha ha let's go let's go 


Catch me in the hood it's goin' down 
Catch me in the 'burbs it's goin' down 
Catch me on a cruise it's goin' down 
Anywhere we meet guaranteed to go down 


Meet me in the trap it's goin' down 
Meet me in the mall it's goin' down 
Meet me in the club it's goin' down 
Anywhere you meet me guaranteed to go down huh 


Let me see you get low you scared you scared 
Drop it like it's hot get down get down 
Let me see you get low you scared you scared 
Drop it like it's hot get down get down 


Break it down back it up 
Fuck it up fuck it up back it up 
Break it down back it up 
Fuck it up fuck it up back it up

Verse 1
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You’ve got me stressing incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up never mistaken but I can't control myself got me calling out for help

Chorus
SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it see it don't feel right
SOS please someone help me

Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turning can't sleep at night

Verse 2
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you're on my mind it’s got me losing it
I'm lost you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you're on my mind it's got me losing it
I'm lost you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

Chorus
SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it see it don't feel right
SOS please someone help me

You got me tossin' and turning can't sleep at night

This situation oh it's agitating me
And I've been trying oh to keep keep my sanity
I know I know I've got to get out of this misery
As much as you 've always been good to me gotta say goodbye

Chorus
SOS please someone help me

You got me tossin' and turning can't sleep at night Koo
Oh well imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words

"What a beautiful wedding
What a beautiful wedding" says a bridesmaid to a waiter
"And yes but what a shame
What a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore"

I chime in with a
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door"
No it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

I chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door"
No it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of

Oh well in fact
Well I'll look at it this way
I mean technically our marriage is saved
Well this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne

Oh well in fact
Well I'll look at it this way
I mean technically our marriage is saved
Well this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne pour the champagne

I chime in with a
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door"
No it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

I chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door"
No it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

Again I chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door"
No it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality

I chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door"
No it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold
Move along move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Move along move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through
Move along
Go on go on go on go on
When everything is wrong we move along
Go on go on go on go on
When everything is wrong we move along
Along along along
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along move along just to make it through
Move along Go on go on go on

Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and Mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world what does your company take me for
Black bandanna sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana

She's a runner rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin' "Baby whatcha gonna"
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess I'm your priest yeah

Yeah yeah

She's a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess I'm your priest yeah

Who knew the other side of you
Who knew what others died to prove
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say say say

Pushed the fader gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh

Gone too fast

California rest in peace

California show your teeth

I can certainly provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "What Hurts the Most" by Rascal Flatts 

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could've been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder gettin' up gettin' dressed livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could've been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could've been
And not seein' that lovin' you
Is what I was tryin' to do

Not seein' that lovin' you
That's what I was trying to do
Intro
Verse 1:
Step one you say "We need to talk"
He walks you say "Sit down It's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Chorus:
Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Verse 2:
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And I pray to God he hears you

Chorus:
Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Bridge:
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Chorus:
Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night
Had I known how to save a life 

Outro:
How to save a life
How to save a life
Where did I go wrong 
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up 
With you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love his trust
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore oh

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

No no no
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own

We don't need
Anything
Or anyone

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
They're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things
Will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world
Honey why you calling me so late
It's kinda hard to talk right now
Honey why are you crying
Is everything okay
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Well my girl's in the next room  
Sometimes I wish she was you  
I guess we never really moved on  
It's really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  

And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
It's funny that you're calling me tonight  
And yes I've dreamt of you too  
And does he know you're talking to me  
Will it start a fight  
No I don't think she has a clue  

Well my girl's in the next room  
Sometimes I wish she was you  
I guess we never really moved on  
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  

And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  

Repeat Chorus  

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  

Repeat Chorus  

Girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel

Couldn't stand to be apart

She says she's no good with words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
"A joke of a romantic" or stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too overdramatic
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse"
Vs "no one should ever feel like"
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by
Dance dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance dance
And these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
You always fold just before you're found out
Drink up its last call last resort
But only the first mistake and I
Give in to the rythym
As hearts collapse tonight
We'll dance alone to the tune of your death
We'll love again
We'll laugh again
And it's better off this way
Dance dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance dance
And these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me a little bit show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress whoooa
Love tip four in the morning
Come on and show me your teeth
Dance dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance dance
And these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Dance dance
Dance dance
Dance dance
She take my money when I'm in need

Way over town that digs on me

But she ain't messin' with no broke n*****s
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' with no broke n*****s

Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
Farrari and jewels the village charm

You'll be my American boy American boy

He said hey sister it's really really nice to meet ya'
I just met this five foot seven guy who's just my type
I like the way he's speaking his confidence is peaking
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And no I ain't been to M-I-A
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's heart awaits
First let's see the west end
I'll show you to my brethren
I'm liking this American boy American boy
Take me on a trip I'd like to go someday
Take me to New York I'd like to see LA

Let's go on the subway take me to your hood
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneaker's looking fresh to death I'm lovin' those Shell Toe's
Walkin' that walk talk that slick talk
I'm likin' this American boy American boy
Take me on a trip I'd like to go someday
Take me to Chicago San Francisco Bay
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy American boy

Can we get away this weekend

Take me to New Orleans I want to see LA
LA confidential
You and me we're unstoppable

Now everybody knows all gold diggers
Are not you-know-who's and every brother with money
Don't necessarily mean he's a hun It's a fact
But if she's gon' take what you're worth
Then you're a dead man
Lupe Fiasco
She wears high heels I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
Verse 1: Kanye West
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a trifling friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me
She give me money Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
When I'm in Need But she ain't messin' with no broke n*****s
She give me money Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
When I'm in need But she ain't messin' with no broke n*****s

Some guys request things you need fleece
Some guys need diamonds some need rings
Or a girl with the body that brings coconut cream


She said "This loving and feeling right"

I said "I'm out of my head out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time"

Promise you gon' do all that you can ooooh ooooh ooooh
Promise me you'll be a faithful man oooooh ohh
Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

This is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it's time to say it
Goodbye goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it it's time to say it
Goodbye goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me


 
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

 
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side
So I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

 
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile a laugh every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

 
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side
So I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

 
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

 
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side
So I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone



She said "Some days I feel like shit
Some days I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but your trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot working my day around a call
But when I pick up I don't have much to say so



So I want you to know it's a little fucked up 
That I'm stuck here waiting at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing
Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone



Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home



You know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now you only stop by every once in a while
Shit I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine and I plan to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say
And I'll tell you I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting at times debatin'
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing
Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone



So I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around and feeling sorta useless
It seems that one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone



Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Whoa
Whoa


Do do do do do

And I don't know what to do cause I'm so intrigued
And I just want to get to know you yeah

Verse 1:
You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover
Tellin' you what to say say
You think I'm stupid
But the truth is
That it's Cupid baby
Lovin' you has made me this way

Chorus:
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger oh yeah
You need to know this situation's
Getting old yeah yeah yeah
And now the more you talk
The less I can take oh
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here
Hey hey hey hey

Verse 2:
Just walk away
Just walk away
I waited here for you
Like a kid waiting after school
So tell me how come you never showed showed
I gave you everything
And never asked for anything
And look at me
I'm all alone alone alone
So before you start defendin'
Baby stop all your pretendin'
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow
Let's get the show on the road today

Chorus:
And hey
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here
Hey hey hey
Oh just walk away
Just walk away
Oh just walk away
Just walk away

Bridge:
I wanna love
I want a fire
To feel the burn
My desires
I wanna man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me
Die for me
Live and breathe for me
Do you care for me
'Cause if you don't then just leave

Chorus:
And hey
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here
Hey hey hey
Just walk away
If you don't have the answer
Walk away
Just walk away
Walk away
Just walk away

Hey hey hey huh

What you know 'bout that
What you know 'bout that
What you know 'bout that
I know all about that

Loaded 44
Getcha open like a door
Makin' competition hit the floor
When I'm cookin' up my metaphors
The whole room start to spin
Dosage of the hypnotic poison I done blended in
With a spinnin' grin and my eyes gettin' slim
So who you with it's best to make the right pick
The first time that I strike I might just cripple your click
See I'm a pit bull I'm just waitin' to get put on a chain
And let me loose in the game I guarantee that I'll bring the pain
What you know 'bout that

What you know 'bout that
What you know 'bout that
What you know 'bout that
I know all about that

You can't ignore me
In heavyweight I float like a butterfly sting like a bee
I'm the voice of the people you can see I'm lethal
And the way I spit I could predict it in my sleep oh
And they say every time I speak I'm preachin'
So I wrote this one and said I'm teachin'
Let my records do the work can't believe I'm either
Way too hot to do features so you know I'm comin' with heaters

Ya n***a claim they hot well they lie
I done sold a quarter million ain't even try
Been ten years in the game all I can say is my
Bad b****es and they still make 'em fly

What you know 'bout that
What you know 'bout that
What you know 'bout that
I know all about that

Know what I'm sayin'
Grand Hustle pimp hey
I'm talkin' 'bout Bankhead mayn'
Nobody knows who I really am
I never felt this empty before
And if I ever need someone to come along
Who's gonna comfort me and keep me strong

We are all rowing the boat of fate
The waves keep on comin' and we can't escape
But if we ever get lost on our way
The waves will guide you through another day

I've been trying to hide
What's been eating away at me
And I can't hold it in anymore

I don't wanna keep it locked inside anymore

So I'm gonna let it out

I won't tell anyone
I'll just scream it out

I'm gonna let it out

I don't wanna keep it locked inside anymore

I'm gonna let it out

I won't tell anyone
I'll just scream it out

I'm gonna let it out

I don't wanna keep it locked inside anymore

I'm gonna let it out
Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh I reach for you
Well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you
Come please I'm callin'
And oh I scream for you
Hurry I'm fallin' I'm fallin'
Show me what it's like to be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right and I'll show you what I can be
And say it for me say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me say it if it's worth savin' me
Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
And all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And all I scream for you

One thing Set it off"
I started on the left
And I had to take him to the right Yeah
He was out of breath
But he kept on dancin' all night


You tried to hit me Ha ha but it's so hard
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on and leave you in the yard
I'll be riding fast lanes swervin' on these lanes
Famous like a drug plane
I'm so different the way I spit
The way I get it you gotta get with it
Ain't no trippin' you like it or you don't
I'm sorry but you can't control me
So what So what So what So what So what


It's so dark I cannot see
What's hangin' in the air
What's right in front of me
I'm gettin' used to these blurry visions
Make one false move it might be your collision
Don't think they know but I'm just trying to live
I ain't committing no crimes they're just lookin' for somethin'
Someone to put in handcuffs screamin' how they caught a criminal
Dog I got a family and a kid I'm just tryna do it right
Get home on time at the end of the night
Get my thing right take flight
But it seems society wanna keep me behind
But I ain't lettin' 'em no way no how


You tried to hit me Ha ha but it's so hard
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on and leave you in the yard
I'll be riding fast lanes swervin' on these lanes

Ain't no trippin' you like it or you don't
I'm sorry but you can't control me
So what So what So what So what So what


My back against the wall it's like I'm back in the bando
But I ain't sellin' bricks you can call me Rambo
Smoke gunpowder and lead
I'm feelin' like a new age Johnny Cash let's dance Uh-huh
Bring that soul clap back like a encore
Any beat that I touch man I make that hoe hot Hoe hot
What's the game been missing
I'ma give it back to y'all
The rings and the chains and the wheels and the broads


You tried to hit me Ha ha but it's so hard

Dragged and socked-up like a puppet
Ankle bracelet on my ankle
Follow me hurdling over the gate

Tryin' to hit a homerun and make an escape
They say success is the best revenge

Tryin' to get some money out these streets and make a statement

Ain't no need to make no scene

And-uh handle yo' business like a gangsta should

Shorty let me tell you about my only vice  
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice  
'Cause when it comes to being good  
I'm tried and true  
And I'll do anything to make it up to you  
I'll predict that I'm unpredictable  
And if you're game we can get together girl  
Swerve on me  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Luda listen girl I'm a diamond in the rough  
A shiny piece of coal tryin' to reach my goal  
My power of speech uh unimpeachable  
Only nineteen but my mind is older  
When things get for real my warm-heart turns colder  
No matter how many times the ladies say I'm brutal  
I never disrespect 'em I'm just tellin' 'em the truth  
And my life is ten percent skill eighty percent fear  
Ten percent concentrated power of will  
Five percent pleasure pleasure fifty percent pain pain  
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  
'Cause I predict that I'm unpredictable  
 I'll tell you when I'm ready girl  
Swerve on me  

  
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice  
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice

I'll predict that I'm unpredictable  
And if you're game we can get together girl  
Swerve on me  

  
Ooh-wee look at the time  
It's two O'clock I'm about to unwind  
Mickeys and St Ides and a lot of Thai  
Lookin' for a little shorty I noticed so fly  
Conversations were great easily we conversate  
I'll predict a sudden urge for us to get our swerve on babe  
That's the way the cookie crumbles  
So love love Uncle Jamie  
But don't hate me for our love makin'
 
  
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice  
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice  
'Cause when it comes to being good

I'll predict that I'm unpredictable  
And if you're game we can get together girl  
Swerve on me  

  
I don't know what it is  
But she's got me doin' things I vowed never to do again  
And it feels so good  
I don't want to end this thing  
  
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice  
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice

Shady Aftermath
look at that bitch shit
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole I think I'm losin' control


Get buzzed get drunk get crunked get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked get sucked get wasted shit-faceded
Pasted blasted puke drinkin' whatever you want to call it


I'm that guy that one the one you hatin' on
I'm the one that done the one you waited on
Notorious so glorious I'm victoriuos
And they battle with us you'll be famous anonymous

Cause I'm the one that came from the anus
And I'm back to take over the game with a bang
Gonna leave with the cash stealin' the change
Name's still the name don't wear it out

Unless you want to see something then blam
In your face you can't replace
Or disgrace the way you say my name
When I'm gone you'll remember us

Even just one of us but you'll miss us
Woo woo woo woo hoo


Get buzzed get drunk get crunked get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked get sucked get wasted shit-faceded
Pasted blasted puke drinkin' whatever you want to call it


All the homies they know what I mean
Baby let me see you shake that thing


Get buzzed get drunk get crunked get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked get sucked get wasted shit-faceded
Pasted blasted puke drinkin' whatever you want to call it


All the homies they know what I mean
Baby let me see you shake that thing

Every time I try to leave somethin' keeps pullin' me back me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go somethin' keeps tellin' me
That girl you ought to know you need to stop playin' and
Come on home


She said she independent but she seem to be the type
Who needy in the dark when she all alone and need a nightlight
She pulled me close she asked "What would you do if I leave"
Would you find somebody new or would you still be lovin' me
"I'm Paris she Nicole no Hilton top model"
I'm thinkin' Adrien Brody she sayin' we Adam Sandler
She stopped laughed for a minute
Asked me if I'll be back I said "Yeah in a minute"
She kissed me I touched her I held her the finer things
Her aura her personality it's diamond rings
She likes me she loves me the chick is wicked
I'm on top of the world she on top of me damn I'm diggin'


Every time I try to leave somethin' keeps pullin' me back me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go somethin' keeps tellin' me
That girl you ought to know you need to stop playin' and
Come on home


You know I done been around the world seen a lot of places
Been around a lot of girls livin' a lot of faces
But all that don't mean nuttin' when the day is done
I'm still feelin' like you're the one
I'm feelin' like you and me can make it baby
This paper chasin' you can take it save it
We can make it baby you need to take a chance with me
All these superficial material things don't stand a chance with me
I got a little more to offer I got a little more to prove
Let's stick together help each other make these power moves
You can be the seed I'll be the water feedin' your mind
This can be ours we can struggle and climb


Every time I try to leave somethin' keeps pullin' me back me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go somethin' keeps tellin' me
That girl you ought to know you need to stop playin' and
Come on home


Baby you're a star baby you're a star
No matter where you are no matter where you are
Don't worry 'bout this thing don't worry 'bout this thing
Just come and take my hand come and take my hand
Baby you're a star baby you're a star
Don't you worry 'bout this glass don't you worry 'bout this glass
Just let me be a man just let me be a man


Every time I try to leave somethin' keeps pullin' me back me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go somethin' keeps tellin' me
That girl you ought to know you need to stop playin' and
Come on home


Baby you're a star don't you worry 'bout this glass
Just let me be a man come on home come on home yeah
Do your chain hang low  
Do it wobble to the flow  
Do it shine in the light  
Is it platinum is it gold  
Could you throw it over your shoulder  
If you hot it make you colder  
Do your chain hang low

Do your chain hang low  
Do it wobble to the flow  
Do it shine in the light  
Is it platinum is it gold  
Could you throw it over your shoulder  
If you hot it make you colder  
Do your chain hang low

Damn baby

Just don't understand where we went wrong

I gave you my heart

I gave you my soul

I gave you

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first

It was about eight years ago don't act like you don't know

We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room

Cause we couldn't be alone

See your mama knew I was something else she knew how I felt

Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse

Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you

Listen and don't trip

I think I need a bottle with a genie in it

Here's my wish list

First one I would create a heart changing love

Second one I'll take yours and fill it all up

Third one but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish we would be best friends

Love would never end it would just begin

If I had one wish you would be my boo

Promise to love you trust me I'll trust you

If I had one wish we would run away

Making love all day have us a baby

If I had one wish I'd make you my whole life

Can you be my genie Make it right

You say I'm messin' around it's just talk

But baby I can tell by the way that you're walking that it's on

Am I more than you bargained for yet
I've been dying to tell you anything
You want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
A notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart and break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team
We're going down down in an earlier round
And Sugar we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God-complex cock it and pull it
We're going down down down down
We're going down down down down
Sugar we're going down swinging down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God-complex cock it and pull it

Life’s like a road that you travel on
When there’s one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There’s a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won’t haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won’t hesitate
Break down the garden gate
There’s not much time left today yea

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you’re going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It’s in my blood and it’s all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands

From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver’s lights
Knock me down and back up again
You’re in my blood I’m not a lonely man

There’s no load I can’t hold
The road is rough this I know
I’ll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we’re survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you’re going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you’re going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you’re going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you’re going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
Don't cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind

Should I let you fall lose it all
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lies
And you're too late

Don't cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind

Couldn't take the blame sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated no wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late

Don't cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind

You never call me when you're sober
You only want it cause it's over it's over
How could I have burned paradise
How could I you were never mine

So don't cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me just get your things
I've made up your mind
Verse 1:
She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline

Chorus:
It'd been a long hard year
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Verse 2:
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on

Chorus:
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on

Bridge:
Oh take it take it from me
Oh ooh woah

Chorus:
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on
Oh Jesus take the wheel
Oh I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on

Easy Crew Big up yuhself seen

I have to block out thoughts of you so I don't lose my head
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you will you never call again


And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face
And will you never try To reach me it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomororw
Hate me for all the things
I didn't do for you


Hate me in ways yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
I'm sober now for three whole months it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself you were trying to stop the fight


And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face
And will you never try To reach me it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomororw
Hate me for all the things
I didn't do for you


It's a calling of the liar it's the rise of the fall
It's the feeling of finding the wall slam your heart to the ground
You're making a kill without making a sound and the story of love
Is hello and goodbye until we meet again


And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face
And will you never try To reach me it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomororw
Hate me for all the things
I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

Goodbye goodbye goodbye
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information oh
They can bend it all they want

So while we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Ain't no secret to success bra work your ass off
And I done worked my ass off

And I won't stop now – I'm a soul survivor whoa

Verse 2: Young Jeezy
Money in the bank I take that to the bank
Ain't no love in the heart of the city – I made it outta there

Yo' nigga might have money – but it ain't like me

Some say I'm greedy some say I'm shady

Yeah it's my life
In my own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
"Daddy look what I made" dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's mommy I can't find mommy where is she"
I don't know go play Hailie baby your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby


And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back


I keep havin' this dream I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry why Why is Mommy cryin'"
Baby Daddy ain't leavin' no more "Daddy you're lyin'
"You always say that you always say this is the last time
"But you ain't leavin' no more Daddy you're mine"
She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it
"Daddy please Daddy don't leave Daddy no stop it"
Goes in her pocket pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture "this'll keep you safe Daddy take it withcha'"
I look up it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin' "you got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
"Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
"And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turnin' to a stage they're gone and this spotlight is on
And I'm singin'


And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back


Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out they seat
The curtain closes they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' "so loud"
I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy it's me help Mommy her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden how did you get to Sweden
"I followed you Daddy you told me that you weren't leavin'
"You lied to me Dad and now you made Mommy sad
"And I bought you this coin it says 'Number One Dad'
"That's all I wanted I just want to give you this coin
"I get the point fine me and Mommy are goin'"
But baby wait "it's too late Dad you made your choice
"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
That's what they want they want you Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep just take another pill
Yeah I bet you you will You rap about it yeah word k-keep it real
I hear applause all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around find a gun on the ground cock it
Put it to my brain scream "Die Shady" and pop it
The sky darkens my life flashes the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up alarm clock's ringin' there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swingin' I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

Verse 1:
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams they got her kissing 'cause I don't get sleep no

Turn forever hand in hand

Love forever love is free

Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahaha

Verse 1  
Chemistry was crazy from the get-go neither one of us knew why  
We didn't build nothing overnight  
Cuz a love like this takes some time  
People swore it off as a phase  
Said we can't see that love right in front of our faces uh  
Said ain't gonna work no let it go no  
But the love that we made uh-huh  
Made it very clear yes it did  
There's none like you I I  
They don't make 'em like you no more

Verse 1:
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive

Chorus:
'Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side

Verse 2:
Your love for me was everything I wanted to be
The heart that's falling apart and my world-it falls apart
Now you're gone and I'm here alone
With nothing but a memory to call my own

Chorus:
'Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side

Bridge:
I just want to be with you
Baby I just don't know what to do
I can hardly breathe and I need to feel you here with me yeah

Chorus:
'Cause everytime we touch I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last
Need you by my side
Shake your money maker

Yeah I'm the one who's the son of the city of Crenshaw
With the big fat skinny waist ice cream everyday
You can bet your bottom dollar that I'm here to stay
And I won't be denied
So n***a better slide when I say

Every time I come in I gotta go in
Then I gotta get it I gotta blow it
And I gotta show that any little thing that I be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter cause I'm constantly pursuing

and she already know we 'bout to blow like
Stacks on deck Patrón on ice
We can pop bottles all night
Baby you could have whatever you like

I said you could have whatever you like
Yeah baby you could have whatever you like

Late night sex so wet and so tight
I'll gas up the jet for you tonight
And baby you could go wherever you like
Yeah baby you could go wherever you like

I said you could go wherever you like
Yeah baby you could go wherever you like

Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Babygirl you on a mission
Your body's an instrument let me play it like a musician

Every time I come in I gotta go in
Then I gotta get it I gotta blow it
And I gotta show that any little thing that I be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter 'cause I'm constantly pursuing

Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke breaststroke stroke of a genius
I'm tryna tell you how I need a girl that could move
Make her hips and her body talk to me boo

Turning around watching it bounce
Wondering just how many calories up in her ounce
Wanna take her to the house cause I'm aroused
Excuse my French but I'm in the mood to take the juice box down

Every time I come in I gotta go in
Then I gotta get it I gotta blow it
And I gotta show that any little thing that I be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter 'cause I'm constantly pursuing

I said you could have whatever you like
Yeah baby you could have whatever you like

Late night sex so wet and so tight
I'll gas up the jet for you tonight
And baby you could go wherever you like

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar
Don't you act like you're afraid of
Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to tip ya
Throw your hands up in the air
If you's a true player
Watch my life
Pass me by
In the rearview mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer

I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Yeah


'Cause I want you and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger like a burning
To find the place I've never been

Now I'm broken and I'm faded
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

I've been dying inside
Little by little
Nowhere to go
But going out of my mind
In endless circles

Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still


'Cause I want you and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger like a burning
To find the place I've never been

Now I'm broken and I'm faded
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

Falling faster
Barely breathing
Give me something
To believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head


'Cause I want you and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger like a burning
To find the place I've never been

Now I'm broken and I'm faded
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me
This is my absolute pleasure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Who Says You Can't Go Home" by Bon Jovi featuring Jennifer Nettles:

I spent 20 years tryin' to get out of this place
I was lookin' for somethin' I couldn't replace
I was runnin' away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I been there done that and I ain't lookin' back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home Who says you can't go home

I was raised on these streets a concrete jungle
I saw love come and go
I've seen a fire burn out and I've seen a rainbow
I felt the breeze in my hair felt the ground beneath my feet
I've heard the sound of a thousand who've said before me
It's a dead-end street if you don't believe
And what good is just a phone call And what good is just a card
Here's to ya a toast for everyone hear me out
I've seen my hometown lit up like a Christmas tree
I left town when I was 18 with a head full of dreams
I'll be there whenever the welcome home signs rusted and faded
Who says you can't go home Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home Who says you can't go home

Who says you can't go back Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go
Who says you can't go home It's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright
What day is it And in what month
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you

Something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you

Something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

So here we are trying to make sense of it all
As I'm trying to fall asleep tonight
I'm trying to figure out what's wrong and what's right
And I'll probably be up all night

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you
What day is it
And in what month
This clock never seemed so alive
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Stupid Girls" by Pink:

Aha aha
Stupid girl stupid girls stupid girls
Maybe if I act like that that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Go to Fred Segal you'll find them there
Laughing loud so all the little people stare
Looking for a daddy to pay for the champagne
Drop a name
What happened to the dreams of a girl president
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees
Where oh where have the smart people gone
Oh where oh where could they be
Maybe if I act like that that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Break it down now
Disease's growing it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take any more
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see
Disasters all around
World despaired
Their only concern
Will they **** up my hair
Maybe if I act like that that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Maybe if I act like that flipping my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that I don't wanna be a stupid girl
I'm a brunette I'm a girl I'm smart and I know everything
These are the truths the bittersweet truths
Dreams smart girls
You wanna dance

Verse 1:
I am unwritten can't read my mind I'm undefined
I'm just beginning the pen's in my hand ending unplanned

Pre-Chorus:
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Chorus:
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Verse 2:
I break tradition sometimes my tries are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes but I can't live that way oh oh

Pre-Chorus:
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Chorus:
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

Bridge:
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breakin' up
And throwin' their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say hey


Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you


I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breakin' up
And throwin' their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say hey


Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you


And now
Ain't nothing else I can need nothing else I can need
And now

I got you we'll be making love endlessly

Nobody gonna love me better

Nobody gonna take me higher

I see the one 'cause she be that lady Hey
I feel you creeping I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'til you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh
Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the flat now
That rearview mirror looking like a spotlight
Feeling so good tonight
Akon I'm on the radio station playing jams
I feel the game getting ready here we go
You're now rocking with the best mayne
I'm about to test your reflex so bend climb pose

So homie don't bring your girl to meet me
'Cause I'ma send her back feet first with the dent in her head
It's a party baby you can come as you please
So just hopscotch and jump to the beat
And you don't see me greet me or meet me
'Cause I'm antisocial and I don't f*** with people
And I don't f*** with people
Except for the people that I'm f***ing with
And I don't know if you notice or have noticed
Although I'm not the tallest of the fellas I'm in the Guinness book
'Cause I'm a world recorder so tell the bartender to save a
Paul Wall T-pain and Weezy

I see the one 'cause she be that lady Hey
I feel you creeping I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'til you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh
