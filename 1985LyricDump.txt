I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Now that you're gone Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone What I did's so wrong so wrong
That you had to leave me alone

I was I was just a selfish fool
With a-pretendin' a pretendin'
Couldn't see the forest for the trees

Now that you're gone Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone Well what I did's so wrong so wrong
That you had to leave me alone

Now that you're gone now that you're gone
I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Now that you're gone Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone What I did's so wrong so wrong
That you had to leave me alone

I was I was just a shoulder to cry on
A face to long forget
A shoulder to cry on Now that you're gone
A face to long forget Now that you're gone
A shoulder to cry on Now that you're gone
A face to long forget Now that you're gone
A shoulder to cry on Now that you're gone
A face to long forget Now that you're gone
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
And I wanna feel I wanna feel what love is
I know I know you can show me

Let's talk about love
I wanna know what love is the love that you feel inside
I want you to show me I'm feeling so much love
I wanna feel what love is no you just can't hide
I know you can show me yeah

I wanna know what love is
Let's talk about love I know I know you can show me
I wanna feel it I wanna feel what love is
I wanna feel it I know I know you can show me

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never need it
One headline why believe it
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

I want my I want my MTV
Now look at them yo-yos that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb


We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these colour TV's


See the little faggot with the earring and the make-up
Yeah buddy that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot he's a millionaire
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these colour TV's Lord


I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama she got it stickin' in the camera
Man we could have some fun
And he's up there what's that Hawaiian noises
Bangin' on the bongoes like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free


Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love OK

Take on me take on me
Take me on take on me
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me take on me
Take me on take on me
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh the things that you say
Is it life or
Just to play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me take on me
Take me on take on me
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Take on me take on me
Take me on take on me
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Easy lover she'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover she'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other and I'm just trying to make you see

You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it

She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you

Get out quick 'cause seeing is believing

You'll ever know

She's an easy lover she'll get a hold on you believe it

I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction you make everything so clear

And even as I wander I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crushing through your door
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you girl
'Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find

And even as I wander I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore no
Verse 1:
Lookin' back on the track
For a little green bag
Got to find just the kind or losin' my mind
Outta sight in the night
Outta sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way

Chorus:
Outta sight in the night
Outta sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way
Outta sight in the night
Outta sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way

Verse 2:
Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs lookin' behind

Reachin' out touchin' a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere


Bridge:
We built this city we built this city on rock and roll
Built this city we built this city on rock and roll
Built this city we built this city on rock and roll
Built this city we built this city on rock and roll

Verse 3:
Say you don't know me or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla sinking in your fight
Too many runaways eating up the night
Marconi plays the mamba listen to the radio don't you remember

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good mmm make a wrong right
Power of love will keep you home at night

Don't need money don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love

That's the power of love
First time you feel it it might make you sad
Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power that makes the world go'round

And it don't take money don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love

You feel the power of love
Can you feel it
Hmmm
It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' till you feel
You feel the power just feel the power of love
That's the power that's the power of love
Hey hey hey hey 
Ohhh

Won't you come see about me
I'll be alone dancing you know it baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and

Love's strange surreal in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on

Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart baby

Don't You Forget About Me
Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't You Forget About Me

Will you stand above me
Look my way never love me
Rain keeps falling rain keeps falling
Down down down

Will you recognize me
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling rain keeps falling
Down down down down

Hey hey hey hey
Ohhhh

Don't You Try to Pretend
It's My Feeling We'll Win In The End
I Won't Harm You
Or Touch Your Defenses
Vanity And Security

Don't You Forget About Me
I'll Be Alone Dancing You Know It Baby
Going To Take You Apart
I'll Put Us Back Together At Heart Baby

Don't You Forget About Me
Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't You Forget About Me

As You Walk On By
Will You Call My Name
As You Walk On By
Will You Call My Name

When You Walk Away
Or Will You Walk Away
Will You Walk Away
Come On Call My Name
Will You Call My Name

I say
La la la
Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
The time is passing by
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love cherish the life cherish the love
I will cherish you tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come
For all we know
But we have this moment
Tonight I'll hold you tight
So close so tight
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love cherish the life cherish the love
I will cherish you tonight
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love cherish the life cherish the love
I will cherish you tonight
Cherish the love cherish the life we live
Cherish the love cherish the life we live
Cherish the love cherish the life we live
Cherish the love cherish the life we live
Cherish the love cherish the life we live

Growin' up you don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by movin' straight ahead you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone everything has changed


Play the game you know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on only you can do what must be done


You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner and you're tryin' to break free
I can see a new horizon underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher


Will I be a man in motion or a man who's just in love
And as the fire gets higher
Will it burn brighter or die out for good


I can climb the highest mountain cross the wildest sea
I can feel St Elmo's Fire burnin' in me burnin' in me


Just once in his life a man has his time
And my time is now I'm comin' alive
I can hear the music playin' I can see the banners flyin'
Feel like you're back again and hope ridin' high


Will I be a man in motion or a man who's just in love
And as the fire climbs higher
Will it burn brighter or die out for good


I can climb the highest mountain cross the wildest sea
I can feel St Elmo's Fire burnin' in me burnin' in me
The heat is on on the street
Inside your head on every beat
And the beat's so loud deep inside
The pressure's high just to stay alive

'Cause the heat is on
Oh-wo-ho caught up in the action I'm looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it tell me can you feel it tell me can you feel it

The heat is on the heat is on the heat is on
The heat is on the heat is on the heat is on

Oh it's on the street the heat is on
The heat is on the beat is the beat is the beat is on
I'm going to the edge I'm going to the end
No one's gonna stop me now I'm going to break out

The heat is on oh-wo-ho oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action I'm looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it tell me can you feel it tell me can you feel it

The heat is on the heat is on the heat is on
The heat is on the heat is on the heat is on
The heat is on oh it's on the street
The heat is on oh-wo-ho oh-wo-ho oh-wo-ho oh-wo-ho
The heat is on the heat is on the heat is on
There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
Oh and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone somehow will soon make a change
We're all a part of God's great big family
And the truth you know
Love is all we need


We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Well send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand


We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Well well well well let us realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one


We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Shout shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on I'm talking to you come on


In violent times you shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white they really really ought to know
Those one-track minds that took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye you shouldn't have to jump for joy


You shouldn't have to shout for joy shout shout
Let it all out these are the things I can do without
Come on I'm talking to you shout shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without come on


But I'm talking to you come on


Shout shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on I'm talking to you come on


They gave you life and in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to show the tale


Shout shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on I'm talking to you come on


Shout shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on I'm talking to you come on


Shout shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on I'm talking to you come on


I'm talking to you I'm talking to you
In violent times you shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white they really really ought to know
Those one-track minds that took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye you shouldn't have to jump for joy
Shout shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on I'm talking to you come on
Shout shout let it all out
Call up ring once hang up the phone  
To let me know you made it home  
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover  
If she's with me I'll blink the lights  
To let you know tonight's the night  
For me and you my part-time lover  

We are undercover passion on the run  
Chasing love up against the sun  
We are strangers by day lovers by night  
Knowing it's so wrong but feeling so right  

If I'm with friends and we should meet  
Just pass me by don't even speak  
Know the word's "discreet" when part-time lovers  
But if there's some emergency  
Have a male friend to ask for me  
So then she won't peek its really you my part-time lover  

We are undercover passion on the run  
Chasing love up against the sun  
We are strangers by day lovers by night  
Knowing it's so wrong but feeling so right  

We are undercover passion on the run  
Chasing love up against the sun  
We are strangers by day lovers by night  
Knowing it's so wrong but feeling so right  

I've got something that I must tell  
Last night someone rang our doorbell  
And it was not you my part-time lover  
And then a man called our exchange  
But didn't want to leave his name  
I guess that two can play the game  
Of part-time lovers  

You and me part-time lovers  
But oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

You and me part-time lovers  
But oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

You and me part-time lovers  
But oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

You and me part-time lovers  

Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

You and me part-time lovers  

Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

You and me part-time lovers  

Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

You and me part-time lovers  

Oh what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  

You and me
Oh yeah

Work work

Somebody told me

"Boy everything she wants is everything she sees"

I guess I must have loved you

'Cause I said you were the perfect girl for me

Maybe but now we're six months older

And everything you want and everything you see

Is out of reach not good enough

I don't know what the hell you want from me oh

Take take

Take what you want

But baby baby I'll never forget you

I'll never let you go

Oh-whoa oh-whoa

Push me in a corner

But I'll come fighting back

And make me feel like a prisoner

Tell me I'm not free oh-whoa oh-whoa

But I'll set you free

Something that you should know

There's a time to let go

And a time to show we're growin' apart

This is that time

'Cause everything she wants is everything she sees

If you're lookin' for somebody

Who loves you

Like your love

Then you need

Somebody

Somebody

To hold you

Somebody

Somebody

Somebody

Somebody

I want you so much darling I wanna hold you near
Want to whisper sweet and tender in your ear
Can't stand the thought of you with somebody else
Got to have your love got to have it all to myself


I say loverboy oh loverboy
Can't you see that I'm feeling down
I say loverboy oh loverboy
Can't you see my heart's on the ground


Every time you're near me I get that urge to love you
Need your loving arms to hold me tight
Can't face this world without someone to love tonight
I'm the kind of guy who's not afraid to show affection
And I'll give it all to you if you give me your attention

Gonna make you mine all mine


I say loverboy oh loverboy
Can't you see that I'm feeling down
I say loverboy oh loverboy
Can't you see my heart's on the ground

The sun goes down the night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up and the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room and down on the street
Moving through the crowds through the midnight heat
The traffic crawls the sirens scream
You look at the faces it's just like a dream


Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been
'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night


Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon sky
You're searching for something but you don't know why
You're chasing the dragon you're trying to win a race
Before tomorrow comes you'll find the answer in her face
In the city you can't escape the pain
You gotta deal with it it's the price you pay for love
And you pray that someday you'll find a way out of here
But you know in your heart that you belong to the city


Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been
'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the music you belong to the night


Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon sky
You were born in the city concrete under your feet
It's in your moves it's in your blood
You're a man of the street
When you said goodbye you were on the run
Trying to get away from everything you've done


If you wanna find what you're looking for
Come on down to the city
You'll never find what you're looking for
But it's where you'll find everything you need
Just wanna get to know you better

Girl I like your groove

Oh yeah

Sexy sexy sexy

Girl I want to be the one

To make your body feel right

Well all night

Oh Sheila let me love you

Until the morning comes

Oh Sheila you know I want to be

The only one to hold you yeah

Hold you

Oh yeah

Girl I feel so alive

When you're near me

You're all I need

All I need

And I can't deny it

Oh Sheila let me love you

Until the morning comes

Oh Sheila you know I want to be

The only one to hold you yeah

Hold you

I'll take good care of you

Like no one ever did before

I'll never hurt you girl

I'll always love you more and more

Oh Sheila let me love you

Until the morning comes

Oh Sheila you know I want to be

The only one to hold you yeah

Hold you
Come with me my love
To the sea
The sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Do you remember
When we met
That's the day
I knew you were my pet

I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me
To the sea
Of love

Do you remember
When we met
That's the day
I knew you were my pet

I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me
To the sea
Of love
Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places feel the chill
Nightfall covers me but you know the plans I'm making
Still overspread with a chilling thrill

Listen to the bass it's the one on the top
Swingin' with the sinners in the vestibule
Icicles within my heart
A tearful part and the whole story is true

The verses sung to the beat of the drum
Through all and the facts remain
Elusive calls did you to me
Two notes back and we're on again

Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places feel the chill
Nightfall covers me but you know the plans I'm making
Still overspread with a chilling thrill

History repeats itself
It's no surprise and the rhythm rhymes
Can't deny it's a symptom of the time
We're meeting with the plan this time

Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places feel the chill
Nightfall covers me but you know the plans I'm making
Still overspread with a chilling thrill

As we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire to fatal sounds of broken dreams
"The Wild Boys" by Duran Duran:

Wild boys wild boys wild boys 
Wild boys wild boys wild boys 

The wild boys are calling 
On their way back from the fire 
In August moon's surrender to 
A dust cloud on the rise 

Wild boys fallen far from glory 
Reckless and so hungered 
On the razors edge you trail 
Because there's murder by the roadside 

In a sore afraid new world 
They tried to break us 
Looks like they'll try again 

Wild boys never lose it 
Wild boys never chose this way 
Wild boys never close your eyes 
Wild boys always shine 

You got sirens for a welcome 
There's blood stain for your pain 
And your telephone been ringing 
While you're dancing in the rain 

Wild boys wonder where is glory 
Where is all you angels 
Now the figureheads have fell 
And lovers war with arrows over 
Secrets they could tell 

They tried to tame you 
Looks like they'll try again 

Wild boys never lose it 
Wild boys never chose this way 
Wild boys never close your eyes 
Wild boys always shine 

The wild boys are calling 
On their way back from the fire 
In august moons surrender to 
A dust cloud on the rise 

Wild boys fallen far from glory 
Reckless and so hungered 
On the razors edge you trail 
Because there's murder by the roadside 

In a sore afraid new world 
They tried to break us 
Looks like they'll try again 

Wild boys never lose it 
Wild boys never chose this way 
Wild boys never close your eyes 
Wild boys always shine 

Wild boys wild boys wild boys"

So in love when we're together

From tonight until the end of time

Always on my mind in my heart
In my soul

You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you

No one needs you more than I need you
You got it Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Nightshift" by Commodores:

Marvin he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song his heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds and I still can hear him say

Aw talk to me so you can see what's going on
Say you will sing your songs forevermore evermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds comin' down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night it's gonna be all right on the nightshift
You found another home I know you're not alone on the nightshift

Jackie hey what'you doing now
It seems like yesterday when we were working out
Jackie you set the world on fire
You came and gifted us with your love it lifted us higher and higher

Keep it up and we'll be there at your side
Say you will sing your songs forevermore evermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds comin' down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night it's gonna be all right on the nightshift
You found another home I know you're not alone on the nightshift

An old man he was next in line
He came to play and he blew our minds
He was 76 and he owed it to himself
To show us all that he could still get his kicks

Everyone was glad that he came along
'Cause he said that he was weak in the legs
But he could still play a mean guitar
Without missing a beat you know what I'm talking 'bout

Gonna be some sweet sounds comin' down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud oh I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night it's gonna be all right on the nightshift
You found another home I know you're not alone on the nightshift

Gonna miss you Marvin Gonna miss you brother
I'll say for myself for me and my guys you made us feel alright You made us feel much better
We'll miss you Marvin baby Gonna miss you brother
Always hangin' on hangin' in We'll miss you Marvin always coming up with a song to sing We'll miss you Marvin
Oh baby I'll miss you Marvin Gonna miss you brother
I promise to sometimes sing a song for you We'll miss you Marvin and the world Gonna miss you brother
We'll be singing it with you We'll miss you Marvin and the world Gonna miss you brother
All the sweet sounds that you made We'll miss you Marvin
All those love melodies We'll miss you Marvin

Tonight we'll dedicate to you Gonna miss you brother
I'll sing my heart for you We'll miss you Marvin yeah
And all the love that I feel Gonna miss you brother

Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive


It's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger


Face to face out in the heat
Hangin' tough stayin' hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive


It's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger


Risin' up straight to the top
Had the guts got the glory
Went the distance now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive


It's the eye of the tiger it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Strut" by Sheena Easton:

I may be a lover but I ain't no dancer
Got my finger on the trigger but I don't give a damn
I'll be the first to admit it's been a blue moon since I last shaved my legs
But I've been busy being wonderful

If you know just what I mean
Don't need nobody baby I learned how to dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Separate Lives" by Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin:

You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room

I came to take you out tonight
But you said "I need just one more night alone in your arms"

I said "I don't mind but you know that I need you"
And I'll take care of the children for you

Well alright okay so be it
We'll just pretend that we never met
At the beginning it wasn't there
We were lovers but that didn't mean we cared

You say "I'm so empty that I can't even cry"
There's nothing left to believe in
But I won't be the one to tell you goodbye
I found it hard to believe in

We'd only just begun
I remember when we met
The way you touched me I was scared to death
You remember too how we spent the night
I remember how you asked me why

Why why why

Why why you loved me and how could I answer
When I was half out of my mind

You asked me for my love and I gave you a bunch of reasons
Why I never could believe that it would last

And now you're telling me
You're going to leave me and I'm going fast

You say "I'm so empty that I can't even cry"
There's nothing left to believe in
And we both knew the reasons why
But I won't be the one to say goodbye

I won't be the one to say goodbye
I won't be the one to say goodbye
I won't be the one to say goodbye
I won't be the one to say

Goodbye
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Raspberry Beret" by Prince & the Revolution:


I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely


Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her ooh I saw her
She walked in through the out door out door


She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a secondhand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her


Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
No I didn't I-I just couldn't
Say was the only thing I wanted


To place her warm velvet box
On my cheek uh-huh
To feel the unshaved portion of her leg
Velvet then ooh
Thunder oh lightning it's getting exciting
Lights up the sky oh strawberry


The smell of the trees
And the sound of the river
Are more than enough to please my soul
I'll never never never never
Ever leave her no no


Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
No I didn't I-I just couldn't
Say was the only thing I wanted


To see her bathing in the lake oh
She's so fine
I'd never let another lover
Mine mine mine mine


Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her ooh I saw her
She walked in through the out door out door yeah


Raspberry beret ooh
Raspberry beret
I think I I think I I think I love her
Raspberry beret
The kind you find the kind you find in a secondhand store oh no no
Raspberry beret oh yeah
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret

I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing 'cause this love is everlasting


Suddenly life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of
You wake up suddenly you're in love


Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before now you're all I'm living for


Suddenly life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of
You wake up suddenly you're in love


Each day I pray this love affair would last forever
Ooh hoo suddenly
Bangkok Oriental setting
And the city don't know that the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world in a
Show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tyrolean spa had the chess boards in it
All change don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or
Or this place

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces brother

It's a drag it's a bore it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board not looking at the city

Whaddya mean Ya seen one crowded polluted stinking town

Tea girls warm and sweet sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest

I get my kicks above the waistline sunshine

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha

Thank God I'm only watching the game
Controlling it
I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

So you better go back to your bars
Your temples your massage parlours

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me
If you love somebody set them free
If it's a mirror you want just look into my eyes
Or a whipping boy somebody to despise
Or a prisoner in the dark searching for the light
If you love somebody set them free

If you need somebody you can always find me
If you want someone to hold you can reach out to me
I've got some space for you to breathe in
I've got enough love for you to feed in
If you love somebody set them free

If you love somebody set them free
If you love somebody set them free
If you love somebody set them free

You are an obsession
I cannot sleep
I am your possession
Unopened at your feet

There's no balance
No equality
Be still I will not accept defeat


I will have you
Yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you


You are an obsession you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me


I will have you
Yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you
Some boys kiss me some boys hug me
I think they're OK
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mr Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause they are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world material
Living in a material world
repeat

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

A material a material a material a material world
Living in a material world material
Living in a material world

repeat and fade
Talking talking
Talking talking

A prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Hot whispers in the night
I'm captured by your spell

Oh yes I'm touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion

Should I should I

Chorus
You better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
Cause I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth

You better be good to me
I think it's also right
That we don't need to fight
We stand face to face
And you present your case
And I present mine
And we stand there

And we'll argue all day
Even if we should disagree
Ooh yeah you better be good to me

Chorus

C'mon baby
And hold me tight
Cause you couldn't buy
And you know money can't buy
What I'm feeling

Listen why do I have to be your prisoner
Why can't I have one love and one lover
Listen baby let me live my life

Ah all of this pain and strife
Oh should I live just to plea for you
So go on and make your choices
I'll go make mine

Chorus

You better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
Cause I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth

Chorus

Talking talking
He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jewel box life diamond nights and ruby lights high in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls
Diamond life lover boy
We move in space with minimum waste
And maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start
No need to ask he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator smooth operator
Smooth operator
Coast to coast LA to Chicago western male
Across the north and south to Key Largo love for sale
Face to face each classic case
We shadowbox and double cross
Yet need the chase
A license to love insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold
No need to ask he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator smooth operator
Smooth operator
They came at night leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
"I'm never coming back"
They heard him cry
And I believe him
Well he never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long
Billy Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anyone that I can do without
There was no answer
He left no trace
I guess there was nothin' left to say
I'm coming back to where I started
So don't you leave me alone
"Say you'll stay"
'Cause if you go away
I'll think you meant goodbye
Billy Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anyone that I can do without
Billy Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anyone that I can do without
Without without

All through the night
I'll be awake and I'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time when time is new
Oh all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end


All through the night stray cat is crying
So stray cat sings back
All through the night they have forgotten
What by day they lack
Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end


But if my voice is lost in darkness
I know that time will bear witness
Oh all through the night
These whispers in the dark
Oh all through the night
Glimmering shadows that find the light
Oh all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end


All through the night stray cat is crying
So stray cat sings back
All through the night they have forgotten
What by day they lack
Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end


Oh the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there let me stay there a while
Oh the whole world is in your eyes


All through the night stray cat is crying
So stray cat sings back
All through the night they have forgotten
What by day they lack
Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days glory days

Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking about

Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days glory days

Think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah just sitting back trying to recapture
And a little of the glory ofwell time slips away
And leaves you with nothing mister but
Boring stories of glory days

Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days glory days
Verse 1:
You got me dancin' and cryin' rollin' and flying

But I ain't done yet fellas
Misled hmm misled

Verse 2:
You got me thinkin' of wedding rings and diamond rings

Love don't let me go

Would I lie to you
Would I lie to you honey
Now would I say something that wasn't true
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you


My eyes couldn't bear to see you tryin' 
I'd rather stop I'm tellin' you the truth
Than to see you crying


I tried to tell you
But you didn't want to listen
Now you're finding out
Love's not perfect it's a mission
But I wouldn't be here if I didn't care


My eyes couldn't bear to see you tryin' 
I'd rather stop I'm tellin' you the truth
Than to see you crying


Would I lie to you
Would I lie to you honey
Now would I say something that wasn't true
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you


My eyes couldn't bear to see you tryin'
I'd rather stop I'm tellin' you the truth
Than to see you cryin'

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "No More Lonely Nights" by Paul McCartney:

I can wait another day until I call you
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything a flutter
But another lonely night and another and another
Might take forever

We've only got each other to blame it's all the same to me
Love is gonna get you baby someday one way or another

Chorus:
No more lonely nights never be another
No more lonely nights never seen another
You're my guiding light day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No I'll never go away

Yes I know what you're feeling
I've been there before
Never gonna let you go
No more lonely nights never be another
No more lonely nights never seen another
You're my guiding light day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No I'll never go away

bridge
Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again naturally

Chorus:
No more lonely nights never be another
No more lonely nights never seen another
You're my guiding light day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No I'll never go away

No more lonely nights I'll never be another
No more lonely nights oh no
You're my guiding light day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No I'll never go away

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Can't Hold Back" by Survivor:

There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
I've been holding back the night
I've been searching for a clue from you
I'm gonna try with all my might
To make this story line come true
Can you feel me tremble when we touch
Can you feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait
I can't hold back I can't hold back
I can't hold back I can't hold back
I see your eyes behind the mask
You're afraid to reveal your heart
Afraid that I might see
That beneath the scars you're just like me
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait
I can't hold back I can't hold back
I can't hold back I can't hold back
Met a girl she was half out of her mind
She said "I'm gonna have to leave ya behind"
Well she took me by the hand
I could see she was a fiery one
Her eyes flicker with a fatalistic glow
She said "I'm gonna have to leave ya ya know"
Too late for goodbyes too late for tears
Too late to turn back now that we know the years
I I love you more than words could ever say
I I love you darling come what may
There's now nothing left to prove no use to deny
This simple truth can't be refused I won't be a liar
I can see that you're the real thing babe
The only one that makes me feel this way
Together we could take on the world my love
Forever we could live as one my love
Too late for goodbyes too late for tears
Too late to turn back now that we know the years
I I love you more than words could ever say
I I love you darling come what may

Sitting on the doorstep of the house I can't afford
I can feel you there thinking of a reason
Hoping that the facts will pass just like before
Wondering if the neighbours might say something

Don't need no reasons don't need no lies
This is the power of the moment
This is the moment of our lives
This is the power of the moment

Ooh if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let it be let it be
Ooh if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let it be let it be

Watching all the people
People walking by
Wondering where they're going
Wishing they could tell me why

Oh I'm feeling higher than a tower
And I'm feeling more than a mile high

Oh if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let it be let it be
Ooh if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let it be let it be

This is the power of the moment
This is the moment of our lives
Verse 1:
I don't know what this world is coming to 
But I know one thing 
That this is the life for me 
Baby cause I'm a freak 

Verse 2:
I love the way you love me 
You're all that I ever need 
When we're together it feels so right 
Let's make love tonight 

Chorus:
We're solid solid as a rock 
And nothing's gonna stop us now 
We're solid solid as a rock 
And nothing's gonna stop us now 

Verse 3:
We found love in each other's arms 
And we'll never let it go 
Our love is strong and it's here to stay 
And we'll never lose our way 

Chorus:
We're solid solid as a rock 
And nothing's gonna stop us now 
We're solid solid as a rock 
And nothing's gonna stop us now 

Bridge:
I won't let you down 
No I won't ever leave 
Cause darling you mean the world to me 

Chorus:
We're solid solid as a rock 
And nothing's gonna stop us now 
We're solid solid as a rock 
And nothing's gonna stop us now 

Outro:
We're solid solid as a rock 
We're solid solid as a rock 
We're solid solid as a rock 
We're solid solid as a rock
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Angel" by Madonna:

Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near


You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize


Oooh you're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
In disguise I can see it in your eyes
Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why


You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize


Oooh you're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
In disguise I can see it in your eyes
So maybe I'll be a little less afraid
Know that together we could only be okay
I will never forget the way you made me feel
I will never forget all the things you've done for me


You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize


You're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
You must be an angel
Oooh you're an angel
You must be an angel
Oooh you're an angel
Hey little girl is your Daddy home

Tell me now baby is he good to you

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby  
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley

Only you can cool my desire

Down on my luck and up against the wind  
A forty day and night just beginning to begin  
I'm all jacked up and time to let you in  
Cause love is like the fastest thing faster than anything  

I'd like to take you just as far as I can  
I'd like to be your method of modern love  
I won't paraphrase or simplify  
This is absolutely real we're running side by side  

You and I  
Time after time  
Something new  
I never stop to think what I offer you  

Or is this just the way it is when you're young and you're in love  
Or is this just the way it is when forever's not enough  
I'd like to take you just as far as I can  
I'd like to be your method of modern love  

I don't want to fight  
I don't want control  
I'd like to be with you alone  

Girl you've got something special  
I've got nothing to lose  
But it took me all this time to find  
What it is that makes me feel alive  

I'd like to take you just as far as I can  
I'd like to be your method of modern love  
Method of modern love

What's wrong with this lonely ol' night
In this empty house
There's nothing to lose and there's nothing to be gained
When emptiness is all that surrounds you now
You don't have to pretend you're not lonely tonight
You don't have to pretend it's all right
There's nothing like a lonely lonely night
To make you feel like you're the only one alive
Oh oh oh lonely ol' night
Haven't slept in days and I'm coming down
Red eyes and tears lookin' for my baby downtown
Downtown
Gonna find her tonight if I have to walk till dawn
Walk till dawn
I'll be all right on this lonely ol' night

A fortress in which nobody enters
A fortress in which nobody understands
I am losing my way
In a world without sound
And I am afraid
I am losing my sight as I stumble through
This barbed wire web that surrounds you
Don't fence me in

Let me ride through the wide open
Let me know freedom
In my heart and my soul
A fortress a fortress
A fortress around your heart
A fortress a fortress
A fortress around your heart
Opening up this prison in which I live
And holding up a mirror to my self
And letting me see my soul again
Walking through the space and falling through
The stars above the fields of Poland
To swallow the darkness inside
And feel my heart fill with fire
Once more I am pierced
Through the center of the light
And I am whole again
I am whole again
Don't fence me in
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open
Let me know freedom
In my soul and my heart yeah

They're pickin' up the prisoners
And puttin' 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance dance
Rebels been rebels Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance dance dance
They mix it up right in the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round with blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance dance dance
Wild-eyed pistols wavers who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
Well the government bugged the men's room
And all she wants to do is dance dance
To keep an eye on the deeds and the do's of the who's who
And all she wants to do is dance

I can't talk politics like they want me to
And all she wants to do is dance dance
But I know that there's somethin' goin' on
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
They're pickin' up the prisoners
And puttin' 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance dance
Rebels been rebels since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
Well I can't talk about the hunger
People sleepin' in the street
And all she wants to do is dance dance
But when you're talkin' 'bout destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

All she wants to do is dance
Dance
All she wants to do is dance
Dance
All she wants to do is dance
Dance
Dance dance dance

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Sugar Walls" by Sheena Easton:


My sugar walls
My sugar walls


Blood races to your private spots
Lets me know there's a fire
You can't fight passion when passion is hot
Temperatures rise inside my sugar walls


Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never want to fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls my sugar walls


Take advantage it's all yours
I'm giving you keys to a brand new Porsche
Come on and touch the private parts
The private parts


Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never want to fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls


I know lots of games to play
Inside my sugar walls
Let's ride the waves of my sugar falls
Forbidden pleasures I'll give them all
Inside my sugar walls


Let me take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never want to fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls


My sugar walls
My sugar walls
Shake it up is all that we know
Using bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see

Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around

Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes

Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't use them so much
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me

Take a look around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around

Oh oh
Oh oh

Repeating endlessly
Repeating endlessly
Repeating endlessly
Repeating endlessly

Take a look around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around

Oh oh
Oh oh
A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you
It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you
You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you
Oh thinking about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me coming back for more

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Oh once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feeling down
Yeah nothing could change what you mean to me
Oh there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

I've been waiting for so long
For something to arrive
For love to come along
Now our dreams are coming true
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you

And baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
Oh oh oh
We're in heaven
Yeah you're all that I want
You're all that I need

Cool it now ooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now ooh slow down
You're gonna fall in love


You're walking in the schoolyard
Just trying to keep your cool
You say you're not a hard hard-hearted person
But you're acting like a fool


Why don't you chill out
Listen to me
Cool it now you're gonna lose control


Cool it now ooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now ooh slow down
You're gonna fall in love


You remember when you told me
That you don't want my lovin' anymore
You said it's over
But lately you've been acting
Like you want it for sure


Why don't you chill out
Listen to me
Cool it now you're gonna lose control


Cool it now ooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now ooh slow down
You're gonna fall in love


Don't let love take you outta your mind
Don't let love take you outta your mind


Cool it now ooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now ooh slow down
You're gonna fall in love


You better stop take a count of what you're doing
And think before you go too far yeah
The things you say the things you do
Are sure to come right back to you


Why don't you chill out
Listen to me
Cool it now you're gonna lose control


Cool it now ooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now ooh slow down
You're gonna fall in love


Cool it now ooh watch out
Cool it now ooh slow down

This is the uncensored lyrics of "Rhythm of the Night" by DeBarge: 

When it feels like
The world is on your shoulders
And all of the madness
Has got you going crazy

It's time to get out
Get out
Into the street
Where all of the action
Is right there at your feet 
Well I know a place where
We can dance the whole night away
Underneath the electric stars

Just come with me
And we can shake your blues right away
You'll be doing fine once the music starts

Oh-oh feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dancing until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind
Oh-oh feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh-oh feel the beat
Of the rhythm of the night
Dancing until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind

Oh-oh oh-oh
Come join the fun
This ain't no time to be staying home
Mmm there's too much going on

Oh-oh oh-oh
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long

Oh-oh feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dancing until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind
Oh-oh feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh-oh feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dancing until the morning light 
Forget about the worries on your mind 
You can leave them all behind

Oh-oh feel the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dancing until the morning light 
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind

Many times I tried to tell you
Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind


We belong to the light we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong we belong
We belong together

We belong we belong
We belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit
Do we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back when you say


We belong to the light we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong we belong
We belong together

We belong we belong
We belong together

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean


We can't hear each other's voices
We can't see each other's tears
Everything will be alright tomorrow
But tonight I need a friend

Cause it's getting late and the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate see it shining in your eye
Cause I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again
Cause I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon
Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight
Don't know what you're doin'
But you must be livin' right yeah

We got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump right in ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine

City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go
Go on girl

Freeway of love
Feels like I'm drivin' on the freeway of love
With the wind and rain in my hair
Freeway of love love

In my pink Cadillac
We'll get there fast
And we'll never look back

Ain't nothin' but a muffin
We gotta do what we gotta do
And love's the only thing that's steady yeah

How can I convince you what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin' you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you
I was living for a dream loving for a moment
Taking on the world that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes I can see forever
The search is over you were with me all the while

Can we last forever will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate
I was living for a dream loving for a moment
Taking on the world that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes I can see forever
The search is over you were with me all the while
Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you

Now at last I hold you now all is said and done
The search has come full circle our destiny's begun
Ahh I was living for a dream loving for a moment
Taking on the world that was just my style
Then I touched your hand I could hear you whisper
The search is over love was right before my eyes

Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely
Since you've been away
I've been thinking of you

Trying to understand
The reason you left me
What were you going through


I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh ooh I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns


As I look around
I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile
Made my heart feel so free

I used to run away
From things that I didn't know
But now that you're gone
I'm feeling lost without a soul


I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh ooh I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns


Sometimes I hear you call my name
When I'm alone at night
I feel like we're just talking
As we used to do
And everything's alright


I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh ooh I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns


Since you've been away
Been down and lonely
Since you've been away
I've been missing you missing you
I've been missing you missing you
I've been missing you missing you
Nobody on the road nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air the summer's out of reach
Empty lake empty streets the sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house though I know you're not home

But I can see you your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream

Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and you're smiling at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said "Don't look back you can never look back"
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

I can see you your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
Looking for something
We can rely on
There's got to be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains
All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
He said shut up
He said shut up
Oh God can't you keep it down
Voices carry
But there's no sound
Louder louder
Louder louder

Whispering

You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cause I'll never stay
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you

I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please
The lyrics to "Be Near Me" by ABC are:

The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear no
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear

Ever had the feeling almost broke in two
Said you wanna leave me for someone new
Don't be nervous don't be shy
Come on over this is no surprise

Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear no
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear

We can build a dream just you and me
We'll vow our love for all to see
And when the hurdles are high
The dreams often die

Don't let it happen to us no
Don't ever go
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear no
Don't ever go too far
And don't disappear

Be near me be near
Be near be near
Never lose sight of the fact
That you need me much more than I need you

Be near me be near
Be near be near
Ever had the feeling only half-way there
Never understanding completely

Never really dared
Ever had the feeling almost broke in two
Said you wanna leave me for someone new

Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear no
Don't ever go too far
And don't disappear

Be near me be near
Be near be near
Never lose sight of the fact
That you need me much more than I need you

Be near me be near
Be near be near
Be near be near
Be near be near
I got my first real six-string

Bought it at the five-and-dime

Played it 'til my fingers bled

It was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school

Had a band and we tried real hard

Jimmy quit and Jody got married

I should've known we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now

That summer seemed to last forever

And if I had the choice

Yeah I'd always wanna be there

Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'

When you got a job to do

Spent my evenings down at the drive-in

And that's when I met you yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch

You told me that you'd wait forever

Oh and when you held my hand

I knew that it was now or never

Those were the best days of my life oh yeah

Back in the summer of '69 oh

Man we were killin' time

We were young and restless

We needed to unwind

I guess nothin' can last forever forever no yeah

And now the times are changin'

Look at everything that's come and gone

Sometimes when I play that old six-string

Think about you wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch

You told me that it'd last forever

Oh and when you held my hand

I knew that it was now or never

Those were the best days of my life oh yeah

Back in the summer of '69 oh

It was the summer of '69 oh yeah

Me and my baby in '69 oh

It was the summer the summer the summer of '69 yeah
Throughout the lyrics of "Freedom" by Wham there are no profane or explicit words Therefore there is no need to provide an uncensored version Here are the unedited lyrics:

Verse 1:
Everyday I hear a different story
People say that you're no good for me
So you love another
And she's making a fool of you
Oh

Chorus:
If you love me baby
Don't deny it
But you left me
And you tried to hide it
Oh baby

Verse 2:
Honey you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you

Chorus:
Now the chorus repeats from above
What About Love
Words and Music by Brian Allen and Jim Vallance

Verse 1: 
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending
And that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart

Chorus:
What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you

Verse 2:
You might need it someday
When you're begging begging me to stay

Bridge:
I'll get by without you
I'll survive without you
I'll be strong
I'll find someone else

Chorus:
What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you

Verse 3:
You might need it someday
When you're begging begging me to stay

Outro:
Ooh what about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you
Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just covering up
Born in the USA I was born in the USA
I was born in the USA born in the USA
Got in a little hometown jam so they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land to go and kill the yellow man
Born in the USA I was born in the USA
I was born in the USA born in the USA
Come back home to the refinery hiring man says "Son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my VA man he said "Son don't you understand"
I had a brother at Khe Sanh fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the USA I was born in the USA
I was born in the USA born in the USA
I'm a long gone daddy in the USA
Born in the USA I'm a cool rocking daddy in the USA
Verse 1:
You and I we're so ambitious
We only wanted the best out of life
Wanted to be stars
But ambition will get you only so far
And you never will find
What you're after
Till you know what you're livin' for

I'm on a sentimental street
And heartaches are all around me
I'm on a sentimental street
And I'm tryin' to get it right
Verse 2:
The neon lights they cut like a razor
Don't let them blind you no no no
Don't you let them take her away
It's hard to hold on to love
In the middle of the night
You can't help the feelings
That you're feeling inside

I'm on a sentimental street
And heartaches are all around me
I'm on a sentimental street
And I'm tryin' to get it right
Bridge:
You can't find love
On Sunset Boulevard
It's not behind the wheel
Of a dream Cadillac car

I'm on a sentimental street
And heartaches are all around me
I'm on a sentimental street
And I'm tryin' to get it right
Coda:
Sentimental street 
Sentimental street 
Sentimental street
You put the boom-boom into my heart whoo whoo
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain whoo whoo
Goes bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same

But something's bugging you
Something ain't right my best friend told me
What you did last night

Left me sleepin' in my bed whoo whoo
I was dreaming but I should have been with you instead
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high yeah yeah

You put the grey skies outta my way outta my way
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
Turned a bright spark into a flame yeah yeah
My beats per minute never been the same

'Cause you're my lady I'm your fool
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Come on baby let's not fight
We'll go dancing everything will be all right

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight

Wake me up before you go-go don't you dare to leave me
Hanging on like a yo-yo wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing boom-boom-boom
I want to hit that high yeah yeah you get the grey skies outta my way
Hanky-panky wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo hanky-panky
Wake me up before you go-go don't you dare leave me
Hangin' on like a yo-yo take me dancing
I wanna hit that high yeah yeah
Swaying room as the music starts strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say is that

I'm crazy for you touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now we begin to move every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind you'll see

I'm crazy for you touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you crazy for you

It's all brand new I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true I'm crazy crazy for you

I don't want to take it anymore
I'll just stay here locked behind the door
Just no time to stop and get away
'Cause I work so hard to make it everyday


Whoo-oooh whoo-oooh
There's no money falling from the sky
Whoo-oooh whoo-oooh
'Cause a man took my heart and robbed me blind

Someone stole my brand new Chevrolet
And the rent is due I got no place to stay
And it's hard to make it when you're doing it alone
Whoo-oooh whoo-oooh
Oh it's a shame but I'm leaving on the midnight train


Whoo-oooh whoo-oooh
I've paid my dues and I'm leaving on the midnight train

I've got to be a macho man
Except take my money don't want to stand
Got to be a macho man
Got to be a macho


Neutron dance Neutron
Neutron dance Neutron
Oh neutron Neutron
Oh neutron Neutron


Whoo-oooh whoo-oooh
There's no more to chance I'm leaving on the midnight train

Neutron dance Neutron
Neutron dance Neutron
Neutron dance Neutron
Neutron dance

Verse 1]
The first time I saw you
Oh you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine
Honey you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss


When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist
Oh whoa
Penny lover my love's on fire
Penny lover you're my one desire
Tell me baby could this be true
That I could need someone like I need you


Nights warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl I surrender
Oh what more can I do
I've spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say


Don't you ever take your love away from me
I'll never stop needing you oh girl

I've been around the world
But there's no place like home
Warm and tender loving
Isn't it a pity I've been
So long alone
So long alone


I've spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your love away from me
Because I love you I love you


Penny lover don't you walk on by
Penny lover don't you make me cry
Can't you see girl who my heart's beating for
Can't you see girl that I need you more

If I had a penny for my thoughts
I'd be rich in love oh baby
If I had a penny for my thoughts
I'd be rich in love oh baby
If I had a penny for my thoughts
I'd be rich in love oh baby
If I had a penny for my thoughts
I'd be rich in love oh baby

I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention


You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much
Oh you're wasting my time you're just—
Just— just wasting time
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart
Don't don't don't throw it away


I made a fire and watching burn
Thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last
Forever no-one knows


You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much
Oh you're wasting my time you're just—
Just— just wasting time
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart
Don't don't don't throw it away
Oh—oh—oh—oh—oh—ah—oh
Oh—oh—oh—oh—oh—ah—oh




Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart
Don't don't don't throw it away
Head over heels Don't throw it away
Head over heels Don't throw it away
Head over heels Don't throw it away
Don't throw it away Head over heels
Don't throw it away Head over heels
Don't throw it away Head over heels
Don't throw it away Head over heels

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a-dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
Jingle bangle jungle dangle
As we sing the jungle song
If you're squeakin' if you're squawkin'
If you're beatin' it up and down the gong
If you're movin' if you're groovin'
If you're makin' it up as you go along
Don't care what the people may say
What the people may do
Whatever it is I'm here for you

One more night one more night
I've been trying ooh to let it go
Sending all my love to you
You are my love you are my life


Oh oh yeah
I know I'm wrong but one more night
One more night


Trying to find the right words to say
Though I try I still feel this way
But if you love me like I love you
We could be for real like we used to


One more night oh one more night
I know I'm wrong but one more night
One more night


I've been trying ooh so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if you love me like you say you do
Then why don't you love me like I love you


One more night oh one more night
I know I'm wrong but one more night
One more night oh one more night
I know I'm wrong but one more night
One more night

If you show me how to get up off the ground
I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down


Lay your hands on me ooh-ooh-ooh
Lay your hands on me ooh-ooh-ooh
Lay your hands on me ooh-ooh-ooh

Verse 1:
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

Chorus:
I was beat incomplete
I'd been had I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah you made me feel
Shiny and new

Verse 2:
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats after first time "With your heartbeat"
Next to mine

Chorus:
Gonna give you all my love boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

Bridge:
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Chorus:
Like a virgin hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Outro:
Like a virgin ooh ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me and your heart beats and you love me
Oh oh yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time
