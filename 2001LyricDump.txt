Desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
Chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

Forgetful in memory
I'm asking all of these questions
One moment of clarity
You've loved me all along

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

Just hanging by a moment
Hanging by a moment
Hanging by a moment
Hanging by a moment
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused

I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Oh oh I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Oh baby I I I I'm fallin'
I I I I'm fallin'
Fallin'
Now that she's back in the atmosphere  
With drops of Jupiter in her hair hey hey  
She acts like summer and walks like rain  
Reminds me that there's a time to change hey hey  
Since the return from her stay on the moon  
She listens like spring and she talks like June hey hey  
Hey hey  
Tell me did you sail across the sun  
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded  
And that heaven is overrated  
Tell me did you fall from a shooting star  
One without a permanent scar  
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself  
Na na na na na na na na na na na na  
And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day  
And did you fall for a shooting star  
Fall for a shooting star  
Now that she's back from that soul vacation  
Tracing her way through the constellation hey hey  
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo reminds me that there's a room to grow hey hey  
Now that she's back in the atmosphere  
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane  
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land  
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet  
And head back to the Milky Way  
And tell me did Venus blow your mind  
Was it everything you wanted to find  
Na na na na na na na na na na na na  
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself  
Na na na na na na na na na na na na  
And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day  
Na na na na na na na na na na na na  
And did you fall for a shooting star  
Fall for a shooting star  
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there  
Na na na na na na na na na na na na  
And she's back from that soul vacation  
Tracing her way through the constellation hey hey yeah  
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na  
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na  
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na  
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na  
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

Certainly here are the uncensored lyrics for "Thank You" by Dido:

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

I drank too much last night got bills to pay my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad it's not so bad

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Girl you got that umph

And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you
And everything I can't remember as fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means
And it's been awhile since I can say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile since I can say I love myself as well and it's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
And it's been awhile but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you
And everything I can't remember as fucked up as it all may seem to be
I know it's me that put me in this position and I'm the one that let myself believe
I let myself believe that these memories serve me well
And I take them out from time to time
And I dust them off like shelf-bound books lost in the recesses of my mind
And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile but I can still remember just the way you taste
And everything I can't remember as fucked up as it all may seem to be
I know it's me that put me in this position and I'm the one that let myself believe
And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry

Verse 1:

Where they at where they at where they at where they at
Where they at where they at where they at where they at

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
We three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way Hey must be the money
If you wanna go and get high wit me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benzy
Oh why must I feel this way Hey must be the money

Chorus:
In the club on the late night feelin' right right
Lookin' tryna spot somethin' real nice nice
Lookin' for a little shorty hot and horny so that I can take home one
I can take home
She can be 18 18 wit an attitude
Or 19 kinda snotty actin' real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on on
You know that it's on on
Baby you got what I need got what I need
Would you say you're just a friend just a friend
And I'm like huh damn that's a Mercedes whoo
The one black the one white the one grey
Like yay Fabolous Mike Jones and Jay-Z

Verse 2:
I'ma phone call away or a broad to say
Hey what's up Livin' like a star
So flossy tellin' 'em it's ours
Hop in the car and go where ever you wanna go
Hop in the car and go where ever you wanna go
Drive until you get to the bottom
I can see you're kinda tipsy
Don't worry bout my eye-line that's my partner in the Bentley
Can't take nothin' home that's a no-no
Before T-Pain hit the radio look at that
Before Akon sold a mill or go-go's danced at the strobe
I'm tryna tell ya like I know
Mane mane it's called it's called pimp-city pimp-city
And you lookin' right but I might letcha drive it
The one long cabriolet top drop and drive by
Can I be the one you talkin' bout
The only one you thinkin' of
I can see you gettin' so hot hot
Just like my Bentley that's why they're checkin' out

Chorus:
In the club on the late night feelin' right right
Lookin' tryna spot somethin' real nice nice
Lookin' for a little shorty hot and horny so that I can take home one
I can take home
She can be 18 18 wit an attitude
Or 19 kind of snotty actin' real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on on
You know that it's on on
Baby you got what I need got what I need
Would you say you're just a friend just a friend
And I'm like huh damn that's a Mercedes whoo

Outro:
Come on now
Yeah let's ride
Verse 1:
You don't know how you met me
You don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
All you know is when I'm with you
I make you free
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea

Chorus:
I'm singing
Follow me everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Verse 2:
And if you're lonely you don't have to be
I'll be right beside you like two trees in a stream
I'll carry you on my back through the night
And we'll burn the sky with our purple light

Chorus:
I'm singing
Follow me everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Bridge:
Won't give you money
I can't give you the sky
You're better off if you don't ask why
I'm not the reason that you go astray
We'll be alright if you don't ask me to stay

Chorus:
Follow me everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Outro:
Follow me everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer
It's driven me before and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I am beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there I'll be there

So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive
Aah oh oh

It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I am beginning to find that when
I drive myself my light is found

Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there I'll be there

Would you choose water over wine hold the wheel and drive
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there I'll be there
Verse 1
Boo Boo just got out the pen
I done time for my crime
And my time served was my fine
Back in the day I was in demand
I hit the block with rocks and got away with it man
One thing's for sure not two for certain
I was real with the game and they was game for the workin'
And fame was a perk when you servin' the fiends
So anxious to cope you'll pay top dollar for dope
No lies in my eyes no tears to cry
Even though inside everything has died

Chorus
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock-down I ain't got a job now
He's just smokin' rock now on and off uptown
Top of the world until the ball drops down

Verse 2
I ain't no saint therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
Actions have reactions don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

Chorus
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock-down I ain't got a job now
He's just smokin' rock now on and off uptown
Top of the world until the ball drops down

Verse 3
Nature has it's own laws and since the dawn of creation
It has been a man's obligation to handle his business
And his family and if it's broke then you have to fix it
Must be willing to finish before you begin
But that ain't the case so I gotta take care of home
Although it might seem foul but everybody ain't able
To dunk off the rebound nobody knows until you tell it
What goes on behind closed doors fiascos in households
But livin' life is a great challenge and a gift from above
It's best to take advantage don't waste it one love

Chorus
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock-down I ain't got a job now
He's just smokin' rock now on and off uptown
Top of the world until the ball drops down
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better  
You thought that I'd be weak without you but I'm stronger  
You thought that I'd be broke without you but I'm richer  
You thought that I'd be sad without you I laugh harder  
You thought I wouldn't grow without you now I'm wiser  
Though that I'd be helpless without you but I'm smarter  
You thought that I'd be stressed without you but I'm chillin'  
You thought I wouldn't sell without you sold nine million  

I'm a survivor what I'm not gon' give up what  
I'm not gon' stop what I'm gon' work harder what  
I'm a survivor what I'm gonna make it what  
I will survive what keep on survivin' what  

Thought I couldn't breathe without you I'm inhaling  
You thought I couldn't see without you perfect vision  
You thought I couldn't last without you but I'm lastin'  
You thought that I would die without you but I'm livin'  
Thought that I would fail without you but I'm on top  
Thought it would be over by now but it won't stop

Verse 1:
Think you gotta keep me iced you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Verse 2:
Think I wanna drive your Benz I don't
If I wanna floss I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Pre-Chorus:
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling

Chorus:
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess
Think you need to confess
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we having fun yet"

Verse 3:
Drinking whiskey and wine
Oh let's ride
I'm seeing signs
Taking all the time
Lost my head thought of you
Caught my breath and I knew

Pre-Chorus:
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Love don't cost a thing
So why you trying to make it a thing

Chorus:
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess
Think you need to confess
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we having fun yet"

Outro:
Love don't cost a thing
And now you wanna drive my Benz
Love don't cost a thing
You wanna be my lover Gotta use some game
Oh well
Love don't cost a thing
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Way You Love Me" by Faith Hill:

If I could grant
You one wish
I’d wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh I love watching you
Baby
When you’re driving me crazy

Ooh I love the way you
Love the way you love me
You love me
There’s nowhere else I’d rather be
Ooh to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I’ll only love you till the end
To the end
Baby I’m forever yours
Girl I’m forever yours

I cross my heart
And hope to die
I’ll only stay with you one more night
And I know
I said it a million times
But I’ll only stay with you one more night yeah yeah

Try to tell you no
But my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop
But your lipstick got me so out of breath
I’d be waking up
In the morning probably hating myself
And I’d be waking up
Feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

But baby
I’m a sucker for all your moves
Your body’s so imperfectly perfect
And I know
That you want me too
Baby I’m forever yours
Girl I’m forever yours

He says he loves me he loves me not
He loves me he loves me not
He says he loves me loves me


Loves me loves me not
Loves me loves me not
Loves me loves me not no

Let's get it percolating bubbling
Why you shaking it I'm still taking it
See I ain't never been the one to hesitate
When I'm feeling kinda horn I just want break
Damn you got me when you're body toying with me
If I believe in God and love how could this happen to me
Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Woo whoa whoa whoa whoa family affair 
Woo whoa whoa whoa whoa
Woo whoa whoa whoa whoa it's a family affair 
The kids' table is where you sat
Can't move until you're full there's no escaping that
But all them plates you took you betta pray #2 is a whole lot of pickin' left to do
But I'm feeling kinda cocky I just want to enjoy eating it
But that's immature I guess that's why they're limited on who they let in here
But that can't be my wife oh whoa whoa whoa
Woo whoa whoa whoa whoa family affair 
Woo whoa whoa whoa whoa
Woo whoa whoa whoa whoa it's a family affair
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance I hope you dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances but they're worth taking
Loving might be a mistake but it's worth making

Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along 
I hope you dance Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder where those years have gone 
Where those years have gone

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Dance I hope you dance
I hope you dance 
Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along 
I hope you dance 
Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder where those years have gone 

Where those years have gone
Verse 1:
See myself in the pouring home
See the light come over now
See myself in the pouring rain
I watch hope come over me

Chorus:
Here we are now going to the east side
I pick up my friends and we start to ride
Ride all night we ride all day
Some may come and some may stay

Verse 2:
Here we are in the pouring home
I watch the light man fall asleep
Boiling heat summer stench
'Need a shave' says the man

Chorus:
Here we are now going to the south side
I pick up my friends and we hope we won't die
Ride all night cause we sleep all day
Swallow pills and smoke our fears away

Verse 3:
Here we are now with obsession
I want to die with obsession

Chorus:
Here we are now going to the north side
I look at my friends as they start to ride
Ride at night we ride all day
Looking for the heaven's way

Verse 4:
What was there what was there to lose
What was there what was there to lose

Chorus:
Here we are now going to the east side
I feel the light betray me I'm not gonna last
I'm just gonna cry cause you'll never come back
I'll never feel your love again

Outro:
Here we go now to the south side
I see my friends they're blossoming
Headed up to the east side
We feel alive we feel alright

You're not the one I need
You're not the one I need
And if you try to hold me back I might explode
Baby The word is out get outta my way
I'm comin' through oh
Get outta my way


Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so mmm-mm-mm-mm
Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time no no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down


Love is a bird she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open


Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so mmm-mm-mm-mm
Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time no no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down


Love will never leave you alone ha
Love will never leave you alone ha
Love will never leave you alone ha
Love will never leave you alone


Don't tell me to stop
Don't you dare don't you dare
Don't tell me to stop
Don't you dare don't you dare
Don't tell me to stop
Don't you dare don't you dare
Don't don't don't don't don't don't tell me to stop mmm-mm-mm-mm
Verse 1:
Back on the road again
Feeling kinda lonely and looking for a friend
My baby's gone I'm left all alone
Feels like my whole world's gone and come undone

Chorus:
I need someone to call my lover
Someone to be there for me
When love's gone and you're all alone
Someone to call my lover

Verse 2:
Now I'm out to have some fun
Gonna find someone to be my number one
I've got to be with somebody new
I guess you know what I'm going through

Chorus:
I need someone to call my lover
Someone to be there for me
When love's gone and you're all alone
Someone to call my lover

Bridge:
I'm looking for somebody I can call on
Looking for the only one that I can give my all to
Tell me if you're that somebody

Chorus:
I need someone to call my lover
Someone to be there for me
When love's gone and you're all alone
Someone to call my lover

Outro:
I need somebody I can call my own
Need somebody that I can hold
Won't you be my sunshine in the rain
Won't you be my sunshine in the rain
Well if you insist:

Well I just heard the news today
It seems my life is going to change
I close my eyes begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything

With arms wide open
With arms wide open

Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath take her by my side
We stand in awe we've created life

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything

With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open

If I had just one wish
Only one demand
I hope she's not like me
I hope she understands

That she can take this life
And hold it by the hand
And she can greet the world
With arms wide open

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything

With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
Verse 1:
I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize
It's over over

Pre-chorus:
It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship gets older older

Chorus:
You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there
I've had the rest of you
Now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair
'Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all

Verse 2:
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never
Is it all
Or are we just friends
Is this how it ends
With a simple telephone call

Pre-chorus:
You leave me here with nothing at all
There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you with memories
I feel it in my heart

Chorus:
You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there
I've had the rest of you
Now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair
'Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all

Bridge:
Please don't hesitate to call
If you want to
Baby you know what you gotta do
When you're lost and you're alone
And you need a light to guide you home
All you need to do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train

Pre-chorus:
New new
You leave me with nothing
Nothing at all

Chorus:
You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there
I've had the rest of you
Now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair
'Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all

Outro:
You know I want it all or nothing at all

Hey I'm just scared

Hey j-j-jaded
You got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child
To me

So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be

You're gettin' it all over me
And serrated


My my baby blue
Yeah I been thinkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you


Hey j-j-jaded
In all its misery
It will always be what I love and hated

And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinkin' of

We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded


My my baby blue
Yeah I'm thinkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm so jaded
And baby I'm afraid of you


Your thinking's so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hate it
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded


Hey j-j-jaded
There ain't no "baby" please
When I'm shootin' the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer


Hey j-j-jaded
Won't you come out to play
J-j-jaded
Won't you come out to play

Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go
Baby I promise that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
And baby I promise
That I will never leave
That everything will be alright ai'ght


I I'll give you everything
Just to keep you satisfied
I won't even question
The joy you give to my soul
You're the meaning of my life
And I I'll never let you go


And I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of
I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love
I cherish every hug
I really love you 

My my love grows stronger
With everything that you do
It gets sweeter and sweeter
And dear I'll never leave you
You're my beginning and my forever
I'll cherish every day 


And I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of
I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love
I cherish every hug
I really love you 


And I…will never betray your trust
My love will stand true
And I… swear to love you more and more
And I… Will never give you up


And I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of
I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love
I cherish every hug
I really love you 
Verse 1:
Sitting here thinking about you
And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you
Cause you were always my boo

Verse 2:
I can't believe that you're gone now
I feel like I can't go on now
You were the one good thing in my life
And now I'm living with all this strife

Chorus:
I'm missing you
And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you
Cause you were always my boo

Verse 3:
I remember all the good times
And all the little things that made you mine
You were my heart and soul
And now I'm feeling so cold

Chorus:
I'm missing you
And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you
Cause you were always my boo

Bridge:
I wish that I could turn back time
And make things right between you and I
But now there's nothing left to say
Cause you've gone and walked away

Chorus:
I'm missing you
And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you
Cause you were always my boo

Outro:
I'm missing you
And I don't know what to do
I never thought that I would lose you
Cause you were always my boo
Ohh ohh 

When the visions around you 
Bring tears to your eyes 
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies 
I'll be your strength 
I'll give you hope 
Keeping your faith when it's gone 
The one you should call 
Was standin' here all along 

And I will take you in my arms 
And hold you right where you belong 
Till the day my life is through 
This I promise you 
This I promise you 

I've loved you forever 
In lifetimes before 
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore 
I give you my word 
I give you my heart 
This is a battle we've won 
And with this vow 
Forever has now begun 

Just close your eyes 
Each lovin' day 
And know this feeling won't go away 
Till the day my life is through 
This I promise you 
This I promise you 

Over and over I fall 
When I hear you call 
Without you in my life baby 
I just wouldn't be living at all 

And I will take I will take you in my arms 
You in my arms Hold you right where you belong 
Till the day my life is through 
This I promise you babe 
Just close your eyes each lovin' day 
And know this feeling won't go away no 
Every word I say is true 
This I promise you 
Every word I say is true 
This I promise you I promise you
Ladies and gentlemen put our hands together for the astonishing

H-O-V-A
I used to give a fuck now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success
It sucks too much stress
I guess I blew up quick 'cause friends I grew up with
See me as a dream but I'm living their nightmares
I'm down in Miami just looking for pairs
All this ass up it's like we're sitting on chairs
It's not a diss song it's just a real song
Feel me
I heard "Motherfuckers sayin' rhymes that ain't theirs"
Mind clear I'm living the life the diamonds and Cristal
I'm just trying to leave a little something to my daughter
I'm not even sure if I'm going to be here tomorrow
Whole crew's in the Deuce M-3's and E-Class
My dogs couldn't tell if I'm in the Bentley or Jag
But just know that nigga it's mine I'm not leasing
I love it when you hate me I see that you can't take me
And I love it when you fake me you see that you can't make me
And I love it just to know that you niggas are thinking
You see you can't see me you can't even see me

There's no way no way
I won't love you
Come what may
Don't you worry 'bout a thing baby
I'll be there for you
You can depend on me

You don't have to worry
I'll be there in a hurry
When you call
Friends are there to catch you when you fall

Here's my shoulder you can lean on me
Talk to me just like a queen should be
And we can do whatever however you want
I'mma treat you right babe
And constantly adore you
I dedicate my life to you
You're my superman
And I'll be your superwoman
I'll be here to hold you down
With a love that's deep as bottom of the ocean

There's no way no way
I won't love you
Come what may
Don't you worry 'bout a thing baby
I'll be there for you
You can depend on me

They say I'm young but my purpose is the inspiration
Just to show I'm not the only one that knows it
See they tell me that one day you'll be under the lights
And people's hands all up in your covers and under your tights
The only way to survive is to be a superstar
Then they'll let you be whoever you are
But just remember if you come
With respect in your demeanor
They'll take your talent and your face and make you a superstar
And when you're driving in your car don't you forget
About the ones who love you from the start
The ones who stuck by led you to the light
The ones who use to tuck you in and kiss you nighty night

There's no way no way
I won't love you
Come what may
Don't you worry 'bout a thing baby
I'll be there for you
You can depend on me

Whenever you need me I'll be there
I'll be around
Just stick with me baby
Take my hand and I won't let go
I'll be your friend and your lover
Your wife your everything
You got the best of me yeah
Verse 1:
She was the window down
I was the radio
She was a turnpike rest stop
I was a wheat field
She was a bright light
I was a misfire
She was a Saturday night
I was a Monday morning

Chorus:
Just wasting time dreaming of rewind
And the days that I wasted alone
All of the times I'm looking for someone
I'm crazy for this girl

Verse 2:
She was the hitchhiker
I was the state trooper
She was a Sunday morning
I was a Friday night
She was a white beach
I was a landfill
She was a Cadillac
I was an old Ford Escort

Chorus

Bridge:
If she ever lets me in
I'm gonna treat her right
I'll be the one who needs her
Who loves her day and night

Chorus x2
Girl you know I'm loving you
And I know you're feeling me too
And you know that I don't sleep
'Cause when I think of you my knees get weak
And girl I'm feeling you hard
And you take care of me take care of you playing your part
And I wanna step it up
Been a while but I'm ready for love
You got me going off them rails
And I don't wanna shake it got me so in love
And I'm tripping off the taste of your lips
DAMN They close to ecstasy
And I'm squeezing trying to hold it
'Cause I'm ready to explode come on give it to me


It's been so long long
Since I've felt this good good
It's been so long long
Since someone understood stood
It's been so long long
Since I've had some some
And you know I'm horny tonight baby


Shit you be like déjà vuing me huh
We kick it like we grew up and went to school look at we
Got me walking around ready to act a fool
We could turn the lights off and take turns playing pool
That's real talk 'cause it's no secret
You like the way I talk reckless on the record
We need to go ahead and wreck this on the mattress
Get it off our chest lay in the bed and get sexed


It's been so long long
Since I've felt this good good
It's been so long long
Since someone understood stood
It's been so long long
Since I've had some some
And you know I'm horny tonight baby


Wanna ride with me ay
Got you heating up like some loving baby boy don't lie to me
Can we carry on like we in the bedroom about to turn it on
Amazing at how you put it down
Got the streets talking 'bout you you the king of the south
Better feel that ay 'cause I'm passing out
That thang real baby what you all about


It's been so long long
Since I've felt this good good
It's been so long long
Since someone understood stood
It's been so long long
Since I've had some some
And you know I'm horny tonight baby


Come on give it to me give it to me
Come on give it to me give it to me
Come on give it to me give it to me
Come on give it to me give it to me
Who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows
Only time

And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose
Only time

Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies
Only time

And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies
Only time

Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart
Night keeps all your heart

Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose
Only time

And who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows
Only time

Who knows Only time
Who knows Only time
Verse 1:
Everybody's got something they had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday that just seems to grow with time
There's no use looking back or wondering
How it could be now or might have been
All this I know but still I can't find ways to let you go

Chorus:
I've never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
A part of me will always be with you

Verse 2:
Somewhere in my memory
I lost all sense of time
And tonight I'm gonna find it yeah
Tonight I will be yours and you will be mine
Up until the moment when we said goodbye
I had been my everything
But when I'm alone
I know that I was wrong

Chorus

Bridge:
All the things that I believed in
I started losing sight of what I used to be
You showed me what it means to love someone
I never knew that I was missing you
Chorus x2
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Stranger in My House" by Tamia:


There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house


I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your name on the door
But you're in my house you're in my bed
I'm the one who let you in
And a voice in my head screams
I can't believe that there's a stranger in my house

It took a while to trust him
But I finally did
I'm so afraid of being hurt again
I forgot what it feels like
And now I'm watchin' him
Actin' like he doesn't know I'm here
And it makes me furious
To know that he's mysterious


I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your name on the door
But you're in my house you're in my bed
I'm the one who let you in
And a voice in my head screams
I can't believe that there's a stranger in my house


This house is not a home
Without my man to hold me tight
And I'm so scared I don't know what to do
So I guess I'll just tell you
You're the stranger in my house


I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your name on the door
But you're in my house you're in my bed
I'm the one who let you in
And a voice in my head screams
I can't believe that there's a stranger in my house


There's no way you could be who you say you are
Won't you leave and take your body with you

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh-whee Sunshine Anderson
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah


What you said
Boy quit playing games
Don't you act like I'm the same
I know there's been another
That's been holding your hand
So stop lying


I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts no


Seen it all before
I don't wanna hear I don't wanna know
Please don't tell me how the story goes
I don't believe that no no

How could you boy
Hurt me and lie to my face
Thinking she'd be the one to take my place
What did she do huh
To make you to see
That you were better off with me


I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts no


Seen it all before
I don't wanna hear I don't wanna know
Please don't tell me how the story goes
I don't believe that no no


Why'd you have to lie to me baby
It's so sad to think about all the innocent trees
That died just to print the lies you told me
Why oh why Boy I don't understand it


Seen it all before
I don't wanna hear I don't wanna know
Please don't tell me how the story goes
I don't believe that no no
No no no no no no no no no no no
Believe no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no
You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love
The space between
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain
But will I hold you again
These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today'
Waste the hours with talking talking
These twisted games we're playing
We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What wild-eyed beast you be
The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain
Will I hold you again
Will I hold you
Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like a devil
In a church in the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down
The space between
Where you smiling high
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The space between
The bullets in our fire fight is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splash in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into
The space between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain
Take my hand
'Cause we're walking out of here
Oh right out of here
Love is all we need here
The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding waiting for you
The space between
Your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time
When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get to have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me

In my dreams
I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart
There'll always be a place for you for all my life

I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am there you'll be
And everywhere I am there you'll be

Well you showed me how it feels
To feel the sky within my reach
And I always will remember all
The strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh I owe so much to you
You were right there for me

'Cause I always saw in you
My light my strength
And I want to thank you now for all the ways
You were right there for me you were right there for me

In my dreams
I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart
There'll always be a place for you for all my life

I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am there you'll be
'Cause I always saw in you
My light my strength
And I want to thank you now for all the ways
You were right there for me you were right there for me

For always
In my dreams
I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart
There'll always be a place for you for all my life

I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am there you'll be
And everywhere I am there you'll be
And everywhere I am there you'll be
Verse 1:  
What is this  Numbers in your pocket  
I remember when you used to throw those things away  
Why do you wanna keep in touch now  
Who gave you a reason to act so shady  

Chorus:  
Baby you know  
You can't hide  
From the feeling inside  
Oh baby I know it's over  

Verse 2:  
Maybe it's the way you touched me  
Made me fall in love with you  
All the memories so close to me  
Just fade away in time  

Chorus:  
Baby you know  
You can't hide  
From the feeling inside  
Oh baby I know it's over  

Bridge:  
How could you love me and leave me  
And never say goodbye  
When I can't sleep at night  
Without holding you tight  

Girl each time I try I just break down and cry  
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead  
Spinnin' around and around  

Chorus:  
Although we've come  
To the end of the road  
Still I can't let go  

It's unnatural  
You belong to me  
I belong to you  

Chorus:  
Although we've come  
To the end of the road  
Still I can't let go  

It's unnatural  
You belong to me  
I belong to you

I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you in the daytime your never home home
I don't see you or your boys around the way way


I think it's time that you found somebody else
No more gonna creep you can stay with yourself so long
No more am I your fool in this game
What you playing me for ain't the same
Baby baby
The love that we had was just enough
You know you gotta leave


I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you in the daytime your never home home
I don't see you or your boys around the way way
I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you in the daytime your never home home
I don't see you or your boys around the way way


I'm doing everything that I could do
No more waking up at night wondering where are you
No more thinking you'll ever be true
Should've known better that's all my fault
Waiting by the phone
Not anymore baby yeah it's your turn to call
I ain't gonna wait


I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you in the daytime your never home home
I don't see you or your boys around the way way
I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you in the daytime your never home home
I don't see you or your boys around the way way


I won't be crying no more
No more your lies won't be the same
No more wondering who what where you been
No more who's car is that why you owe
No more what's in store now I know
No more making me promises you never keep
I don't want your love if you won't be good to me


I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you in the daytime your never home home
I don't see you or your boys around the way way
I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises promises
Looking at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you in the daytime your never home home
I don't see you or your boys around the way way

Every time you see me pass you whistle at me like a flute
Stayin' loyal like a dog

Verse 1:
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said "Daddy when you coming home"
He said the first thing that came to his mind

Chorus:
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

Verse 2:
She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids
They'll be alright wish you were here
I've been thinking about
The last time I held you close
When you asked me to come home
I know I'm overdue

Chorus:
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

Bridge:
He said "I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I can't be there tonight
I promise that I'll make it up to you
When I get home"

Chorus:
'Cause I'm already there
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there
Oh I'm already
There
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "My Baby" by Lil' Romeo:


Lil' Romeo A-town connection Ha-ha My baby

Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Austin" by Blake Shelton:

She left without leaving a number said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin 'cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got

If you're calling 'bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell you're wasting your time I'm not buying
If it's anybody else wait for the tone you know what to do

And PS if this is Austin I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter she heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long what kind of love that must be
She waited three days and then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say but she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake and I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home on Sunday afternoon

And PS if this is Austin I still love you

This time she left her number but not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening and this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where I belong
And by the way boy this is no machine you're talkin' to
Can't you tell this is Austin and I still love you

I still love you
Verse 1:
All aboard okay a-t-t-e-n-t-i-o-n
Attention please yeah yeah yeah 
This is not a test or a joke
Frankly I'm amazed you made it through the smoke
Or the fire marshall marshawn lynch
Scorched your townhouse burnt your bench 
Better evacuate playa here comes the sequel 
Forecasting a BLIZZARD of lyrical unprecidented EVIL
Southern style crazy off the chain 
Don't really give a damn I know that you can't stand 
What's going on let me break it down like fractions 
A penny for your thoughts a quarter for your action 
Dime for your time now baby hold up your end 
A bargain for any man let alone your boyfriend 
Introducing the southern cult hero 
Staring in the movie drinkin gin with the rowdy weirdos 
Outcast by choice a basshead with soul 
Somebody slapping your foot while you're swallowing your roll 

Chorus:
Southern hospitality it's an unwritten law 
Kicking doors and waving profanity and tirades 
Three-six-three-three-oh coming down in a 'llac 
It's a must that I bust and discuss flatulence and thrust 

Verse 2:
Ain't nobody leave the room until I'm through 
Speak now or forever hold your peace 
Your moment of truth you know what you need to do 
Bright lights camera action it's time to see you 
I've got rhymes for days and weeks and months 
I've got more rhymes than I've got grey hairs on my nuts 
I'm old school like bald tires I'm flat out 
I'm hot like seven twenty-one thirteen three four five six 
Blast to the past raise my tongue to the mast 
Tear the roof off of ya mother take a sip of the wood ya sippin' gasoline cup 

Chorus:
Southern hospitality it's an unwritten law 
Kicking doors and waving profanity and tirades 
Three-six-three-three-oh coming down in a 'llac 
It's a must that I bust and discuss flatulence and thrust 

Verse 3:
Pardon me sir don't mess with me you don't real-ly wanna step with me 
Gee whiz I'm just sittin' thinkin' to myself 
Put her phone down put that diet coke on the shelf 
It'll make you smaller but it'll fill ya up quick 
The gutter don't love you you never know who you gonna get 
Why do birds and bees sing songs in the trees 
Let's agree to disagree don't touch me please 
A-hem excuse me Mr Thesaurus 
Can I borrow a cou-ple of words great fantastic 
Good weekendy homerun plateau half court shot baseline dunk 

Chorus:
Southern hospitality it's an unwritten law 
Kicking doors and waving profanity and tirades 
Three-six-three-three-oh coming down in a 'llac 
It's a must that I bust and discuss flatulence and thrust 

Outro:
Welcome to Atlanta jackin' hammers and vogues 
Back to the mackin' and holdin' jack her back 
And givin' a what they want what they don't know 
Is a slow speech southern drag pokin' beans at the park

Ladies and gentlemen
It's that time again
Introducing the hitmaker


I would do anything to win your love
I'd stand naked stoned and stabbed
I would call that fun
Ba da da da da da
I'd be a nymphomaniac dreaming of your cock
Eh eh eh eh
I'd do it all for you just give me what you've got
Ba da da da da da


 Loverboy come on and love me
 Give me more touch me and touch me
 Loverboy come on and take me
 Only you know how to make me
 Shout it to the world "Loverboy come and love me"
 Can you feel the heat
 Loverboy come on and take me

Verse 1:
If I live to be a hundred
And never see the seven wonders
That'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy
I'll just keep on singing this song I'm singing

Chorus:
And I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am

Verse 2:
If I don't become famous
If I never write a novel
I'll be fine
But if I'm never rich and famous
That won't make me a failure
I'll be just fine

Chorus:
And I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am

Bridge:
I know the ups and downs
They make me who I am
I'm proud of all my scars
They make me who I am

Chorus:
And I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am
I'm OK with who I am

Yo check it I don't do black music I don't do white music
I do fight music for high school chicks to like music
So press play and once again it's time for E
To hit hard like CJ Mack with beats and rhymes that's DOPE
So hit it as I rock it and get with it
Put you in the mood and move just like your body wanted
The beat is fat and the rhyme is on time
We got the direction and perfection with a hard rhyme
So let me take you to the max hypnotize your soul
Relax your mind as we roll out of control
With a capital "E" and a period R-icon
That's the name that I sport and rock it all night long
Through the ups and downs I won't stop the rock
I keep risin' to the top as the pop goes the weasel
I like to move it move it ya like to—
Good God ya'll drop it like it's hot come on
Until the break of dawn I keep on keepin' on


Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music


Now let me take a sec to pray unto the music gods
For keepin' me alive so I can do my job
'Cause without my music I'd be lost you see
I got the gift of makin' music a talent naturally
So I do it and don't abuse it 'cause people gettin' damaged
By music from the wicked Hey Yo I can't stand it
Most of these suckas they're R-rated obscene and mean
And I ain't with it 'cause ya know they're killin' off the dream
The dream so unreal that it's hard to perceive
But the message is strong so we can all believe
In the unit and power of Blackness


Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music


Now one two one two ya'll know how it go
I stay fresh by using beats that's old
I'm addicted to the vibe and it's naturally high
As I keep rockin' up rhymes 'cause a rhyme could never die
Like Marvin Gaye said let's get it on
And have the love and respect to each other for it's gone way too long
Ain't no need for frontin' let's relate and unite
Spread the music and let it flow like dynamite
We got George Clinton rockin' it let it go
Soul for real Zapp it up and let it flow
D'Lilah puttin' the R&B into the mix
And Erick Sermon's on the cut ready to fix
The moment and the spirit of joy that makes us live
And come together so we both can give
We give our hearts our souls and we get respect
For the hip-hop and the R&B we connect
Come on


Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music
Music music turn up the music


Music gonna make it all right
Music gonna make it all right
Music gonna make it all right
Music gonna make it all right
Music gonna make it all right
Music gonna make it all right

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Don't Happen Twice" by Kenny Chesney:

I have been thinkin' 'bout our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
I've reached the only logical conclusion
Love ain't supposed to make sense

Happenstance has got me thinkin'
'Bout the way things go
One big movin' mystery
Yeah the biggest ever known

Don't try to fit your love
Into a world that is not ready for you
Do not compromise your feelings
Until you hate yourself too

Everybody asks me
Where you've been hangin' out
Sneaking out with you after midnight
Top down flats on cruisin' down PCH

I'll miss you tomorrow
I might miss you later on tonight
I guess that I've been missin' you
What should I do it don't happen twice

Happenstance has got me thinkin'
'Bout the way things go
One big movin' mystery
Yeah the biggest ever known

Don't try to fit your love
Into a world that is not ready for you
Do not compromise your feelings
Until you hate yourself too

Everybody asks me
Where you've been hangin' out
Sneaking out with you after midnight
Top down flats on cruisin' down PCH

I'll miss you tomorrow
I might miss you later on tonight
I guess that I've been missin' you
What should I do it don't happen twice

Everybody asks me
Where you've been hangin' out
Sneaking out with you after midnight
Top down flats on cruisin' down PCH

I'll miss you tomorrow
I might miss you later on tonight
I guess that I've been missin' you
What should I do it don't happen twice

I said Everybody asks me
Where you've been hangin' out
Sneakin' out with you after midnight
Top down flats on cruisin' down PCH

I'll miss you tomorrow
I might miss you later on tonight
I guess that I've been missin' you
What should I do it don't happen twice

Everybody asks me
Where you've been hangin' out
Sneaking out with you after midnight
Top down flats on cruisin' down PCH

I'll miss you tomorrow
I might miss you later on tonight
I guess that I've been missin' you
What should I do it don't happen twice
Verse 1:
You know I've had some lonely days
I've made mistakes and had to pay
I've had some friends that walked away
Just like mama told me
But there were nights I made you cry
When heaven seemed so far away
And so I prayed
And somehow I know inside

I will find
You're all I need to get by
I will find
You're the air I need to breathe
I will find
You're my destiny
I will find
Love love love
I will find
You're the one who completes me
I will find
Ooh yeah
I will find
He that hath an ear let him hear what I say
Verse 2:
Now even though I've been through the storm
I really want you to understand
That I'm a man just trying to find his way
In this jungle we call life
See I've been doing everything I can
Just to keep a smile on your face
And to give you everything that you need
Girl it's true

Bridge:
You see I was meant for you
And you was meant for me yeah
And I'll make sure that I'll be everything you need
Girl the way you make me feel
Through every thick and thin
What you shared with me
Let's me know that I will win

Verse 1:
I'm over your lies
And I'm over your games
I'm over you asking me
When you know I'm not okay

Bridge:
You call me at night
And I pick up the phone
And though you've been telling me
I know you're not alone

Chorus:
Oh yeah yeah
Don't wanna hear it
Get over yourself
Don't wanna hear it
Get over yourself

Verse 2:
I'm over your hands
And I'm over your mouth
Trying to drag me down
And fill me with self-doubt

Bridge:
You call me at night
And I pick up the phone
Though you've been telling me
I know you're not alone

Chorus:
Oh yeah yeah
Don't wanna hear it
Get over yourself

Get over yourself

Bridge:
I'm over you walking
And I'm over you leaving
I'm over you pretending
That you don't know what you're doing

Chorus:
Oh yeah yeah

Don't wanna hear it
Get over yourself

Outro:
Oh yeah yeah
Don't wanna hear it

Sir Lucious Left Foot got his foot in the door
And we ain't gonna leave 'til we get what we came for
Daughters of Zion so precious with your eyes wide
True player for real ask Pimp C you know what I'm saying
Gettin' slizzard stayin' miffed all calendar year
Two thousand and two thousand and three Ha-ha I'm the DJ
You're the rapper so you wanna verbalize
What it's like inside my ride You want to know what's goin' on
It's gettin' harder and harder I'm not a boulevardster
With bumper kit product that well make you wanna retire
I'm an organ donor you can have my heart or liver
If you have the proper paperwork we'll get started this instant
I got a cup in the car b***h you can drink up if you're thirty-thirsty
Big Snoop Dogg came through drinkin' gin and juice
And gettin' loose wit my nephew Snoop Dogg

Canary yellow seven house of business on display
My n***a Bungle whipped it up so I gone get my rims today
So a n***a can ride out to the colorful hideaway
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snippy with the zipper
It's so icky vicky gooey glad to make your aquaintance
Now we're kissin' let's be specific our tongue's touchin' slug
Your ex-boyfriend had never seen it but it sure sounds good on the phone
Let's not talk about it be about it let's get complex feet up like a Lexus
 dang what's the probability of that
We're mackin' tellin' stories and laughin' while we relaxin'
Mixin' cocktails for these underaged females
Who wanna see a n***a that's breathin' and can unseal
Sho' you right you're damn skippy I'm a treal
And after I leff here I'm goin' to the hotel
And if you're hungry then I can fill you fulla more
In the back of a restaurant on the boat or on the plane
Everytime I close my eyes I can see what you want me to see
And everytime I open my eyes I can see reality
And every time you need me baby I'll be your hero
It's just so fresh and so clean

Verse 1:
He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
Why can't that be me

'Cause in his life he is filled
With all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things
He'd rather not mention right now

But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me
And he says

Chorus:
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do
What would I do Yeah

Verse 2:
Now and dreams we've run away
To a beautiful somewhere
We can leave what's cruel
Behind yea-yeah
Oh as I'm walking down to your house
Nobody's home still I'm scared
All along I know I'll end up

Chorus:
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do
What would I do

Bridge:
I'm falling into this
In your arms and all I feel is
The comfort you bring to me
Well I can't believe
I'm touching you
Hold on to me this feeling
I'm feeling well it's something new

Chorus:
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do
What would I do

Outro:
He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Verse 1: Nas
"Jump out the Range empty out the ashtray
A millionaire mind state I'm still in the projects
Wrote my way out the hood multiplied my dough
Dubbed in Spanish I'm bilingual
Touring Europe rap shows in Asia
State-side I hobnob cheffing up now
Lifestyle ill yo I'm rich and I'm bored
So I drive Porsches buy out the stores
Leave a few hundred grand on the board
Record label's lawless it's like a lie detector
We see through you like it's glass we in the dirt screaming"

Chorus: Bravehearts
"Oochie wally wally oochie bang bang
Pull up in the whip let my nuts hang nigga
Oochie wally wally oochie bang bang
When I do my thing I spoke my brain nigga"

Verse 2: Jungle Bravehearts
"I'ma thug I'ma die for what I stand for
Roc-a-Fella gettin' jacked for gigs in Baltimore
X amount of bullet wounds same amount of tattoos
Put our heads together and we still can't lose
Never snooze Nas'll keep us all laced up
Rap from any angle Rhyme another number to J's cup
When we mix we got baggies that's on the rise now
Criminology niggas just some fly guys now"

Chorus: Bravehearts
"Oochie wally wally oochie bang bang
Pull up in the whip let my nuts hang nigga
Oochie wally wally oochie bang bang
When I do my thing I spoke my brain nigga"

Verse 3: Nas
"New York giants neutral colored Nike Pilots
High-fiends want to buy shit take 'em to flybitch
Top of the projects it's PJ it's all good
Ride through Bushwick smell chicken on the grille
Ride down Flatbush love the way they treat us
Loubies on the feet you owe me for the features
Uh what Respect mine and our streets
I'm so cool with it we blow a g and fall asleep fall asleep"

Chorus: Bravehearts
"Oochie wally wally oochie bang bang
Pull up in the whip let my nuts hang nigga
Oochie wally wally oochie bang bang

Verse 4: Nas
"Queensbridge Murdaville where we smash at
Only screwdrivers speakers and bamboo mat
Under the fubu is a bottle of Gleen
Blue steel in my palm pockets full of green
Queensbridge Murdaville where we blast at
Only screwdrivers speakers and bamboo mat
Under the fubu is a bottle of Gleen
Blue steel in my palm pockets full of green
Life could be better than this slow beats and drumming
Pull the ratch out my airmax start dumping
Queensbridge Murda hear the strings that we're dumping
First read the contract first five we wasn't bluffing
Queensbridge housing 41st we're up to something"

Chorus: Bravehearts
"Oochie wally wally oochie bang bang
Pull up in the whip let my nuts hang nigga
Oochie wally wally oochie bang bang
When I do my thing I spoke my brain nigga"
Memories are just where you laid them
Dragging the waters till the depths give up their dead
What did you expect to find
Was there something you left behind
Don't you remember anything I said when I said

"Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleedin' in my hands in my hands again"

And love love love
Why'd you take so long
Oh why'd you take so long
Danged if I know but it feels like forever
Danged if I know but it feels like forever

Sitting all alone inside your head
How 'bout I make you your own bed
I'll take you for a ride
Down into the dark side
Don't fall away don't let me down
Don't fall away don't let me down
Don't fall away don't let me down

Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleedin' in my hands in my hands
Again oh love love love
Why'd you take so long
Oh why'd you take so long
Danged if I know but it feels like forever
Danged if I know but it feels like forever
Danged if I know but it feels like forever

But it's not a mystery
And I'm sorry but I'm not looking back
Repeat Chorus until fade
Well I took a walk around the world
To ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere
In the sands of time
But I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do yeah

I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something
To do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be
There holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I
Never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back
On solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still
Call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be
There holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite

Running her hands through my 'fro
Bouncing on 24s
While they saying on the radio


It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen

Sipping on coke and rum

It's the freaking weekend baby

H-O-V photo the rap Mona Lisa
Me and my nephew off to the party

Roofless double R like somehow
Hov's a bastard he needs his father
So dad I'm gonna make it regardless
I push a button and let the roof do just what the coupes does
Gotta let the top down AC up
Coke white body got me puffing on cigars
Protocol uh was for dummies is it partially my fault
'Cause they left me for the volume
Smith and Wesson is my tutor
Hold up bad boys moving silence let me introduce ya

I'm Lil' Mo and I'm back with the remix
Can I get a what what You got it what what

In the club with my homies
Trying to get a little V-I
Keep it down on the low key
Cause you know how it is
I saw Shorty she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear you would think that she knew me
So we decided to chill
Conversation got heavy she had me feeling like she's ready to blow watch out
Oh watch out uh
She's saying "come get me" "come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said "baby let's go"
When I told her I said

It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling that body
Got every man in here wishing
Sipping on coke and rum
I'm like "so what I'm drunk"
It's the freaking weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun bap bap bap bap

Now it's like murder she wrote
Once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
Still they can hear you screaming "more"
Girl I'm feeling what you feeling
No more hoping and wishing
I'm bout to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition

It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling that body
Got every man in here wishing
Sipping on coke and rum
I'm like "so what I'm drunk"
It's the freaking weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun bap bap bap bap
Verse 1:
When it's over that's the time I fall in love again
And when it's over that's the time you're in my heart again
And when you go the snow flakes fall
The rivers freeze and so I've come to know

Chorus:
That when it's over I just wanna be closer
I wanna be the one your love
Tonight's the night real life can start again
The day you left I couldn't breathe again

Verse 2:
And when my eyes closed I see you in my head
And when I'm lost I think of you to find again
And when you're gone the cold winds blow
My mind is numb this much I know

Chorus:
That when it's over I just wanna be closer
I wanna be the one your love
Tonight's the night real life can start again
The day you left I couldn't breathe again

Bridge:
And when the ground shakes I feel the quake
Of your love that's why I wait
And when the sun fades I hear your voice say
"It's time to make everything okay"

Chorus:
That when it's over I just wanna be closer
I wanna be the one your love
Tonight's the night real life can start again
The day you left I couldn't breathe again

Outro:
When it's over that's the time I fall in love again

Let's go

My gangsta 'cause I took those pop charts and I'm blacking it up
I'm back in the clubs breaking the clubs
And now I'm trying to ask y'all "What's the chance of us"
'Cause all night I've been waiting for you to dance with me
Now it's time for us to get nasty baby tonight

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Irresistible" by Jessica Simpson:


You know I don't know what it is
But everything about you is so irresistible
Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire


I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire I know I meant to say "no"
But he's irresistible up close and personal
Now inescapable I can hardly breathe
More than just physical deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful irresistible to me


You know I don't know what it is
But something about him is so irresistible
Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire


I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire I know I meant to say "no"
But he's irresistible up close and personal
Now inescapable I can hardly breathe
More than just physical deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful irresistible to me


Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah


I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire I know I meant to say "no"
But he's irresistible up close and personal
Now inescapable I can hardly breathe
More than just physical deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful irresistible to me


Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Verse 1:
It's gettin' so lonely inside this bed
To know if I should lick my wounds
Or say woe is me instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me I'm better off alone
But after midnight mornings will come
And the day will see if you will get some

Chorus:
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light

Verse 2:
I'll turn the tables around I'll watch your guard come down
And oh baby baby baby it's your turn now
I'll be the one that's gonna make you beg
And I'll be the one that you can't forget

Chorus:
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light

Verse 3:
When I'm alone with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright alright
And when the plane came in she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing my high-tops
Running jumping kissing laughing
It's a high I don't want to give up

Chorus:
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light

Chorus:
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light
The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town
You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination
You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
It was a beautiful day

I heard "It's a Great Day to Be Alive" by Travis Tritt;

Verse 1:
I got rice cooking in the microwave
Got a three-day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say
Hey I'm doing alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
Feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced no
I'm just doing alright

Chorus:
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

Verse 2:
It's been fifteen years since I left home
Said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
Oh I hope their doin' alright

Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doin' alright

Chorus:
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

Bridge:
Sometimes it's lonely sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin' desperately
Ain't afraid to hit the ground
Oh but nothin' can stop us
Til we're through you and me
Nothing can stop us and we'll be free

Verse 3:
I got green grass for a pillow
And a woman who knows my soul
Ev'rything I want in this world
Is right here 'cause I got her

Chorus:
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

Outro:
Oh why can't every day be just this good

She said "You shouldn't kiss me like this
        Unless you mean it like that
        'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
        We'll get lost on this dance floor spin you around one more time
        And with your hand in mine we'll take on the world tonight
        Love don't have to feel so wrong
        Kisses like these so sweet it don't take long
        But she won't be gone for long
        You shouldn't kiss me like this unless you mean it like that"
Verse 1:
Boy you caught me
In the moment
I'm not thinkin' straight at all
And boy I'm helpless
Guess that's when I need you most

Chorus:
So dance with me dance with me
Make me sway
Like the breeze on the sea
You have no choice but to feel the beat
So dance with me dance with me
Cause we got nothin' to lose

So dance with me dance with me

Verse 2:
Boy let's take it
Like we mean it
If you want to move just say yes
And boy I'll follow
Right behind you till the end

Chorus:
So dance with me dance with me

You have no choice but to feel the beat
So dance with me dance with me
Cause we got nothin' to lose

Some girls feel best in their tiny dresses
Some girls nothin' but sweatpants looking like a princess
Some girls kiss new lips every single night
They're stayin' out late cause they just celebrating life

Sleepin' in late cause they just celebrating life

You know some days you feel so good in your own skin
But it's okay if you wanna change the body that you came in
'Cause you look greatest when you feel like a damn queen

Let me get the uncensored lyrics of "Hero" by Enrique Iglesias for you:

Would you dance if I asked you to dance
Or would you run and never look back
Would you cry if you saw me crying
And would you save my soul tonight

Would you tremble if I touched your lips
Or would you laugh Oh please tell me this
Now would you die for the one you love
Oh hold me in your arms tonight

I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Would you swear that you'll always be mine
Or would you lie Would you run and hide
Am I in too deep Have I lost my mind
I don't care you're here tonight

I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever

You got them Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Again" by Lenny Kravitz:

I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door

All of my life where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Nor take your crown never

All of my life where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again
Again

All of my life where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again
Again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave

Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun oh and I pay my own bills

The shoes on my feet

The rock I'm rockin'
I've bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it

The watch I'm wearin'
I've bought it
The house I live in
I've bought it
The car I'm driving
I've bought it
I depend on me I depend on me

There you go:

There you are in a darkened room  
And you're all alone looking out the window  
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love  
Like a broken arrow  
Here I stand in the shadows  
Come to me come to me  
Can't you see that nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
My body's longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why why don't you let me love you  
Touch me now and don't let go  
Let me drown in your arms  
Give me no reason to doubt you  
My heart is yours for the taking  
Who'da thought that I'd be here by myself  
Who'da thought that you'd be bad for my health  
Now I know it's true  
I don't wanna be alone anymore  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
My body's longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why why don't you let me love you  
I wanna feel you need me  
Feel you hold me in your arms tonight  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
My body's longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why why why don't you let me love you  
Why don't you let me love you  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
There you are in a darkened room  
And you're all alone
Verse 1:
Love
So many things I've got to tell you
But I'm afraid I don't know how
'Cause there's a possibility
That you'll look at me differently
Love
Ever since the first moment I spoke your name
From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change 'cause

Chorus:
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

Verse 2:
Many days I've longed for you
Wanting you
Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your kiss for your touch for your essence your beautiful essence
Many nights I've cried from the things you do things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you losing you
I know that you're real real
With no doubt or no fears no fears
Or no questions questions

Chorus:
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

At first you didn't mean that much to me no
But now I know that you're all I need oh

You've given me the strength to see that the best is yet to come
And I can do anything now that you're here with me

Chorus:
Love
So many people use your name in vain love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts love
For better or worse I still will choose you first love

I'm from the dirty dirty
Mmm I gotta go hard for the hood
Ooh I'm from the dirty dirty
Mmm I gotta go hard for the hood
Ooh

I'm bouncing off the walls like I'm Looney Tunes
Busta Rhymes Got-cha all in check
Passin' the torch move ya'll feet
This here be a lil' some'in' that's quick
short and swift
Flows just like a thief without being a thief
I'm droppin' bombs but I'm not Iraq
You're a martyr I'm more like an institution
So don't you fix ya' lips to tell me what I am
unless you know one thing - What's that
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
I'm the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I been knockin' girls out since Lando
With Jazze Phae producin' so don't even wonder
What's that thunder - it's just my cargo

I'm pimped-out plus I got a Pimp mentality
I'm 2Pac use your imagination
I'm makin' 'em fear cause they know the visa
mo fire burnin' like a on star seaser
Can't seem to move me every little thing they do is
Foolish I'm just too smooth can't lose
In the air I'm like a Nike Swoosh
So keep your mouth closed and let your eye's talk
You say you're a down south Georgia boy
But you're lookin' like a fool to me
I doubt if you got an ounce of me
So what's up with these false reporters
Tryna bring up my name now I'm mad as hell
I'm with my man Lil Jon and it's a white girls heaven
Looking at me like I'm a CNN

Hold on a second I'm the king of the jungle
I'm runnin' with the monkeys and it's time to rumble
Young man's temper-advertisin' man
Dang I can't chill but my just my gluts gettin' ample
Don't make me toned it down a notch like Hammer
Better yet U like my boy Biggie
What Trust me dog I'm a Doberman Pincher
I can charge a whole of a hundred grand for a picture or a fly
Like Jay said "Y'all not ready"
My tank on empty somethin' makes me wanna fill up
More realer than you cats I can't fake it
So I'ma take it to the break and uh

Ooh I'm from the dirty dirty
Mmm I gotta go hard for the hood
Ooh I'm from the dirty dirty
Mmm I gotta go hard for the hood
Ooh I'm from the dirty dirty
Mmm I gotta go hard for the hood
Ooh I'm from the dirty dirty
Mmm I gotta go hard for the hood
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Crazy" by K-Ci & JoJo:

I don't know why what I'm doing what I'm doing
See baby I apologize
For all the things that I've done that I've done
See I know that I've been a fool for far too long
And baby you don't have to go and run away just come back to papa
Please baby baby won't you stay
If you really love me then why are you leaving me
I can't think think about this crazy day I've had
I kiss you goodbye but I got one more thing to say
Hey

Baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world

And it's breaking my heart in two 'cause I never wanna see you sad
Girl don't be a fool for a boy who will never love you the way that I love you

'Cause I can take you on a nice trip
Have you livin' it up lickin' on your nipple tip
'Cause when I'm sexin' I'm investin' in a long-time

Ooh here's your chance be a man take my hand understand

Had a chance to run Missed that huh
Now ya' stuck needin' dick Swallowed up
In hot pursuit of a star I'd be

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Do" by Toya:


I do I do I do I do
Love you love you love you love you


Boy you got me so confused
I don't know what to do
But there's one thing that I know
I can't let you go


I'm feeling you you're feeling me
So what's it gonna be

So what's it gonna be


I do I do I do I do
Love you love you love you love you


I never thought that I'd find someone like you

Love you love you love you love you

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "One More Day" by Diamond Rio:

Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished for one more day with you

One more day one more time
One more sunset maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you

First thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl
Then I'd unplug the telephone
And keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do with one more day with you

One more day one more time
One more sunset maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day

Leave me wishing still for one more day

Leave me wishing still for one more day with you

While he was schemin'
I was beamim'
In the beamer just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'


So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree-aah
And on the way I grabbed Soley and Mia and as the cash-box rang
I thought everything away


There goes the dreams we used to say
There goes the time we spent away
There goes the love I had but you cheated on me and that's for that now
There goes the house we made a home
There goes you'll never leavin' me alone
For all the lies you told
This is what you owe


While he was braggin' I was comin' down the hill and just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in the bag when he came home I told him to leave me alone

And he cried when I told him
I had enough of all these games and enough of you
I got money in the bank
Shoes on my feet
In comin' on the beat
I hear you dyin' to me
I hope you're satisfied
I see you hopping on your back
You and your nasty all full of that
Lookin' at my eyes
Chorus]
There goes the dreams we used to say
There goes the time we spent away
There goes the love I had but you cheated on me and that's for that now
There goes the house we made a home
There goes you'll never leavin' me alone
For all the lies you told
This is what you owe


Oh now you askin' me what you did wrong
You're dissin' me and it's all in your song
It's not about you're raising their unborn son
It's not about you're raising their unborn son
It's not about you're making me scream
It's not about you're making me scream
It's not about the life that you made with another chick
It's not about the life that you made with another chick
It's not about you're carrying on
It's not about you're carrying on


There goes the dreams we used to say
There goes the time we spent away
There goes the love I had but you cheated on me and that's for that now
There goes the house we made a home
There goes you'll never leavin' me alone
For all the lies you told
This is what you owe


While he was schemin'
I was beamin'
In the beamer just beamin'
Verse 1:
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch

Chorus:
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain that's got me feeling this much
Baby you're a mystery yeah
But you keep me wanting more more
And I can't help but be drawn in by you
I gotta get to know you more more

Verse 2:
All I need to know is where to start
Take my hand and show me forever so we'll never be apart
I don't wanna think about it yeah I just wanna be your mine
And do it all night yeah wanna do it all night

Chorus:
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain that's got me feeling this much
Baby you're a mystery yeah
But you keep me wanting more more
And I can't help but be drawn in by you
I gotta get to know you more more

Bridge:
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the therapy that I'm needing
All of my troubles ain't so bad
When I'm with you yeah ooh-ooh-ooh-yeah

Chorus:
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain that's got me feeling this much
Baby you're a mystery yeah
But you keep me wanting more more
And I can't help but be drawn in by you
I gotta get to know you more more

Outro:
It's just a simple feeling but you mean everything to me
There are different versions of the song but here is one set of uncensored lyrics for "Grown Men Don't Cry" by Tim McGraw:

I pulled into the shopping center
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face

All mornin' I'd been thinkin' my life's so hard
And they wore everything they own livin' in a car
I wanted to tell him it's all gonna be okay
But I just walked away

'Cause grown men don't cry
We don't show pain we don't hurt now and again
We push on don't let nothin' bring us down
'Til they're driving us into the ground
Grown men don't cry

I turned my car around felt a little unashamed
My tears were fallin' down like a summer rain
Asked if they needed a ride somewhere far away
Somewhere far away

She said "We're okay we're just tryin' to get some sleep
Little man had a big day runnin' from these streets
He said 'Mama it's an adventure pack your things
It's time to go away it's time to leave'"

And grown men don't cry
We don't show pain we don't hurt now and again
We push on don't let nothin' bring us down
'Til they're driving us into the ground
Grown men don't cry

I'm sittin' on the edge of my bed
Starin' at a photograph
Everything else has been taken away
But the image in my past

And grown men don't cry
We don't show pain we don't hurt now and again
We push on don't let nothin' bring us down
'Til they're driving us into the ground
Grown men don't cry

No no no
I'm surprised that you want to view uncensored lyrics but I will fulfill your request as it falls under my scope of abilities

I think I've already lost you
I think you're already gone
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak I think you're wrong
I think you're already leaving
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
But now I'm relaxed I can't be sure

I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life
I think I'm just scared to admit it
Trying to forget it somehow

I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life
I think I'm just scared to admit it
Trying to forget it somehow

I think I've had enough of this
I think I might've died a little bit inside
I think I might've died a little bit
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind

I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life
I think I'm just scared to admit it
Trying to forget it somehow

I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life
I think I'm just scared to admit it
Trying to forget it somehow
Desperate for changing 
Starving for truth 
I'm closer to where I started 
Chasing after you 

I'm falling even more in love with you 
Letting go of all I've held on to 
I'm standing here until you make me move 
I'm hanging by a moment here with you 

Forgetting all I'm lacking 
Completely incomplete 
I'll take your invincibility 
And hold on to it tightly 

I'm falling even more in love with you 
Letting go of all I've held on to 
I'm standing here until you make me move 
I'm hanging by a moment here with you 

I'm living for the only thing I know 
I'm running and not quite sure where to go 
And I don't know what I'm diving into 
Just hanging by a moment here with you 

There's nothing else to lose 
There's nothing else to find 
There's nothing in the world 
That can change my mind 

There is nothing else 
There is nothing else 
There is nothing else 

Desperate for changing 
Starving for truth 
I'm closer to where I started 
Chasing after you 

I'm falling even more in love with you 
Letting go of all I've held on to 
I'm standing here until you make me move 
I'm hanging by a moment here with you 

I'm living for the only thing I know 
I'm running and not quite sure where to go 
And I don't know what I'm diving into 
Just hanging by a moment here with you

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair hey hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change hey hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June hey hey
Hey hey
But tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation hey hey
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow hey hey
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story 'bout a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
Can you imagine no love pride deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance freeze-dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
And head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na hey

What's my motherfuckin' name
R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy hoes it's one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two I've been making less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me love me judge me the only man that help is above me holla


If you real ain't no way you're gon' be able to hide it
You remember on how you livin'
Let me pick ya brain do ya remember
Naw you're a non-factor diss me and you get a response though
I'll surprise ya sometimes I'll come outta nowhere
If you're on my line then you want me to fall back 'cause you're a front-runner
I am the r-e-a-l are-you-elle-e
Let's not forget Ja Rule baby


What's my motherfuckin' name
R-U-L-E
Love me or hate me baby but now the games mine
And I'ma keep winnin' and winnin'
On and on and on and on and on and on
You can yell scream let it out fuck it
Say what you say but I'm here to stay c'mon

Uh uh uh huh
Yo yo


Drop your glasses shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one pick one this one classic
Red from blonde yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this why that lips stop askin'
Listen to me baby relax and start passin'
Expressway ha don't try to chase it
Million-dollar boats ha don't try to race it
Feelin' good I'mma make you feel better
Come on
'Cause I'mma be the one to give you more
Than you ever had before oh


So go-lip-lockin' give me the
Your love make it drop
Let me
Your mind


I know I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name
And love is about pain
So stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so back me down in the chains
I'm about givin' and I'mma get mine
You want to see some magic then go and watch me shine
I'm throwin' down a silky line
If you're in a puffy pick it up for me one time
It's about the give and take too you can't mistake
We both are gettin' off so we both are goin' to ache
I'm wantin' to find out what you're all about
Your move baby I'll let you work it out oh


So go-lip-lockin' give me the
Your love make it drop
Let me
Your mind


Hey yo I know I've been on the road and away from my life
But when I'm on the G-side baby you miss me right
And I guess that's why you pay me attention
When I'm at the mall naturally I'm fly in dimension
Is that a metaphor heaven forbid
The Eve of destruction has never been a liar
Keepin' it calm under pressure Eve don't want no messa
And uhh I know you want to get messy but no


So go-lip-lockin' give me the
Your love make it drop
Let me
Your mind
Yo yo oh yeah yeah uh-huh
Yo yo yo


Hey yo ladies drop it down just want to see you touch the ground
Don't be shy let your guard down 'cause a-round
Round here we bumpin' grindin' on the chair
And all that good shit sounds soundin' so good in my ear
You want to take a shot gettin' booed off stage
Then don't be mad at me when you get on and you're whack
Shoulda' thought about that


So go-lip-lockin' give me the
Your love make it drop
Let me
Your mind
If my memory is correct here are the uncensored lyrics for "Thank You" by Dido:

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad

I drank too much last night got bills to pay my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad it's not so bad

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me and I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
You got it Here are uncensored lyrics for "Again" by Lenny Kravitz:

I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Nor take your crown never

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Again again again again again

I want you to know
I believe I believe in you
And all of your dreams
And all that you are

And now I'll stand with you through it all
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Again again again again again

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Again again again again again

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed

Creeping with the girl next door

Verse Three: Rikrok

I had tried to keep her

From what she was about to see

Why should she believe me

When I told her it wasn't me

Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on the right prefix

Whenever you should see her make the gigolo flex

As funny as it be by you it nuh be fi deejay

But if she nah give you no bligh spank her lightly and say

"And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again
Why must I feel this way
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day
And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile but I can still remember just the way you taste
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again
Why must I feel this way
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day
I've been wrong I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we having fun yet"
Yeah yeah yeah no no no
Yeah yeah yeah no
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you
And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile it's been awhile
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be
I know it's me I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me
And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry"
Girl you seem to have mistaken me for somebody who has time for all of this arguing huh I've been through this so many times and I can tell you that it's pointless But I'll give you what you asked for Here are the uncensored lyrics to "U Remind Me" by Usher:

Yo I ain't seeing you in a minute but I got something to tell ya
Listen

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain but girl I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you yeah

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I
I look at you
Wouldn’t believe all of the things
She put me through
This is why I just can’t get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her dream
Oh she was sexing everyone but me
This is why we could never be

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I
I look at you
Wouldn’t believe all of the things
She put me through
This is why I just can’t get with you

I know it's so unfair to you
But I'd be lying to myself if I didn't tell you the truth
See you remind of the days when I was lost and so confused
And so oh so many times I've tried
But every time I tried to get up I just fell back down again

Ooh I'm reminded

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I
I look at you
Wouldn’t believe all of the things
She put me through
This is why I just can’t get with you


You remind meyou remind me

Oh why do I live this way Hey must be the money
If you wanna go and get high wit me

In the club on the late night feelin right
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
Lookin for a little shorty hot and horny so that I can take home
I can take home
She can be 18 18 wit an attitude
Or 19 kinda snotty actin real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
Know that it's on
I peep something comin towards me up the dance floor
Sexy and real slow hey
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly can we go; how could I tell her no
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there




Face and body front and back don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringin nuttin back
You should feel the impact shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that four candy-six with the all black Drag
Got a Noreaga cd playin haters wanna' hate
We gon' ball till we fall; what you think of that
Now watch me rip the tat from my arm
Kickin' in 'till I can't no more
I'm sorry but I have to take this call and I'll be back
So hold up what you want huh
Certified quallity A1 type of guy lookin for that real shorty that'll satisfy
Two steppin' tongue in her ear whassup
Shorty let me know if you wanna ride wit me




You know the name now I got to tell you again
We won't stop til' we get it big up
Everybody want to ride with me


Verse 1:
You don't know how you met me
You don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
All you know is when I'm with you
I make you free
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea

Chorus:
I'm singing: Follow me everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Verse 2:
I'm not worried about the ring you wear
'Cause as long as no one knows then nobody can care
You're feeling guilty and I'm well aware
But you don't look ashamed and baby I'm not scared

Chorus:
I'm singing: Follow me everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Bridge:
Won't give you money I can't give you the sky
You're better off if you don't ask why
I'm not the reason that you go astray
We'll be alright if you don't ask me to stay

Chorus:
I'm singing: Follow me everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Have some fun at the telly go 'head ma show me that you can get naughty
Naughty let's go let's get it on I'm ready
Kick all your legs around me

But it all depends on how you spend your day
Boo no time to be bashful just be
Comfortable and let me know what it takes
Time to settle down now what it takes for Chris

Peaches and cream

Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream

Know what I mean peaches and cream
I need my sugar babe don't you know my taste
Candied-apple love you're the perfect shape
Love the way you sparkle when the light hit the bling
But your lemon-drop rims on your vehicle oh me

Hater by the elevator door's about to close
See y'all later Meet me at the patio
White-grape Cool-Aid love sis it's bound to go

It's like a liquor for the fellas when they see a seven and a half
All I do is add a little cream to peaches now they wanna devour

Right now now is the season for the flavor

Peaches and cream

Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear
Take the wheel and steer
It's driven me before
And it seems to have a vague haunting mass appeal
But lately I am beginning to find
That I should be the one behind the wheel
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
I'll be there
So if I decide to waiver my chance
To be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive oh oh
It's driven me before
And it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I am beginning to find
That when I drive myself my light is found
So whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
I'll be there
Would you choose water over wine
Hold the wheel and drive
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
With open arms and open eyes yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there
I'll be there
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "What Would You Do" by City High:

Verse 1:
Boys and girls wanna hear a true story
Saturday night was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowin' the cup
About five or six strippers tryin' to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonnie she went to Junior High with me
I said "Why you up in there dancin' for cash
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last"
She said
"What would you do If your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money"
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock down I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life"

Chorus:
Mmm yeah
Oh Oh-oh-oh
What would you do
C'mon
What would you do
Unh unh unh
What would you do
What would you do
If your son was at home crying all alone
On the bedroom floor 'cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock down I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life
Yo yo

Verse 2:
Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said "Every day I wake up hoping to die
I need a hug" I said "Girl why"
"Why you wanna put yourself through this" "Why"
I'm listenin' with a shoulder to cry on
Damn the shame in the game girl the game is strong
I thought the same thing till I was shown
That this world was more than just a a bone
Everybody gotta struggle it's never gon' change
Love yours or die hungry ain't nothin' gon' happen for days

Chorus:
What would you do
If your son was at home crying all alone
On the bedroom floor 'cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock down I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life
Yo yo

Verse 1:
Now that you're out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you now I'm wiser
You thought that I'd be helpless without you but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you sold nine million

Chorus:
I'm a survivor what I'm not gon' give up what
I'm not gon' stop what I'm gon' work harder what
I'm a survivor what I'm gonna make it what
I will survive what keep on survivin' what

Verse 2:
Thought I couldn't breathe without you I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now but it won't stop
Thought that I would self-destruct but I'm still here
Even in my years to come I'm still gon' be here

Chorus:
I'm a survivor what I'm not gon' give up what
I'm not gon' stop what I'm gon' work harder what
I'm a survivor what I'm gonna make it what
I will survive what keep on survivin' what

Bridge:
I'm wishin' you the best pray that you are blessed
Much success no stress and lots of happiness
I'm better than that I'm not gon' blast you on the radio
I'm better than that I'm not gon' lie on you and your family
I'm better than that I'm not gon' hate on you in the magazines
I'm better than that I'm not gon' compromise my Christianity
I'm better than that You know I'm not gon' diss you on the internet
'Cause my mama taught me better than that

Chorus:
I'm a survivor what I'm not gon' give up what
I'm not gon' stop what I'm gon' work harder what
I'm a survivor what I'm gonna make it what
I will survive what keep on survivin' what

If I could grant
You one wish
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh I love watching you
Baby
When you're driving me crazy

Ooh I love the way you
Love the way you love me

There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Ooh to feel the way I feel
With your arms around me
I only wish that you
Could see the way you love me

See you're the only one
Who knows what I need
And I would never be
Without you baby
Never thought I'd find it
So easy to be in love
No one ever made it
This easy for me

Ooh I love the way you
Love the way you love me

Ooh to feel the way I feel
With your arms around me

Chorus:

'Cause I ain't never seen a face like yours
You make me feel like I'm so damn fine

Verse 2:
I know you can't deny the chemistry
Between you me and that guy
When I tell you that I love you endlessly
Don't you know I'm the one that you should be with

Don't need no hateration in this dancery
Don't need no hateration in this dancery
Cause I'ma have you in this dancery dancery
Let's get it percolatin' in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin' in this dancery
You don't need no more troubles in this dancery
Cause I'ma put you in my dancery dancery
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance x2

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances but they're worth taking
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth making

Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance x4
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "South Side" by Moby featuring Gwen Stefani:

See myself in the pouring home
See the light see the light the flame in your eyes
Feel the heat from the fire glow
Hear somebody coming I see the street light

Enter the darkness the movie starts
The symphony sounds like deep blue sea
I feel the rhythm flowing through my veins
Can't somebody help me 'cause I don't feel right

Whenever the music's playing
Feels so right
Can you hear me saying
Let's all dance tonight

Joining the south side party
It's a rhythm divine
Full of bittersweet life

Drinkin' up the white sunshine
It's a black sky that never ends
A teaser until the light shines
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the line

Enter the darkness you feel the symphony blow
More than you can take more than you've ever known
The lights go up the music dies
But you know I'll see you same place same time

Whenever the music's playing
Feels so right
Can you feel me saying
Let's all dance tonight

Joining the south side party
It's a rhythm divine
Full of bittersweet life

Joining the south side party
Dancing in the street light
Full of good lovin'

Joining the south side party
It's a rhythm divine
Full of bittersweet life

Joining the south side party
Dancing in the street light
Full of good lovin'

Well the uncensored lyrics of "With Arms Wide Open" by Creed are:

"Well I just heard the news today
It seems my life is going to change
I close my eyes begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe we've created life

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open

If I had just one wish
Only one demand
I hope he's not like me
I hope he understands
That he can take this life
And hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world
With arms wide open

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
I'll show you everything
Oh yeah
With arms wide open"
Verse 1:
It's after midnight
And she's on your phone
Saying come over
'Cause she's all alone
I could tell it was your ex
By your tone
Why is she calling now
After so long

Chorus:
Now what is it that she wants
Tell me what is it that she needs
Did she hear 'bout the brand new Benzes
That you just bought for me
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't share no mutual friends
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96

What'cha gonna do
When you can't say no
When her feelings start to show boy
What'cha gonna do
What'cha gonna do
When she wants you back
What'cha gonna do
Verse 2:
Said it was over
But now it's not enough
Trying to play me
But you're out of luck
Don't wanna make a scene
I really try to be
The bigger girl and ignore the hurt
But it's something 'bout these words
That just don't feel right
You're telling me you're staying the night
But you're feeling used
And she's all right

Chorus:
Now what is it that she wants
Tell me what is it that she needs
Did she hear 'bout the brand new Benzes
That you just bought for me
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't share no mutual friends
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96

What'cha gonna do
When you can't say no
When her feelings start to show boy
What'cha gonna do
What'cha gonna do
When she wants you back
What'cha gonna do
Bridge:
I don't believe a word you're saying
I think that she's just a friend
Oh I'm not gonna be suspicious
But then why you're still lying
It's a case of the ex
I'ma have to say goodbye
When I'm feeling telling me you're creeping
Telling me you're sleeping with the enemy

Chorus:
Now what is it that she wants
Tell me what is it that she needs
Did she hear 'bout the brand new Benzes
That you just bought for me
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't share no mutual friends
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96

What'cha gonna do
When you can't say no
When her feelings start to show boy
What'cha gonna do
What'cha gonna do
When she wants you back
What'cha gonna do

All or nothing


I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize it's over over
It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's gotta give
As sharing this relationship gets older older


You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there
I've had the rest of you
Now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair


'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere else to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never
Is it all
Or are we just friends
Is this how it ends
With a simple telephone call
You leave me here with nothing at all


There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you with memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it show it
Then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
Those times I don't believe it's right I know it know it


Don't leave me here with nothing
'Cause I want it all
You're beautiful and that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

Chorus:
I'm like a bird I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is I don't know where my home is
and baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

Chorus x3

I'm like a bird I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is
I'll do my best to provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Kryptonite" by 3 Doors Down:

Well I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do yeah
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
You called me strong you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head if not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
Yeah
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman
If I'm alive and well will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

The flow o' the century always timeless HOV
Thank you for comin' out tonight you coulda been anywhere in the world
But you're here with us we appreciate that uh
H to the Izzo V to the Izzay
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin' 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed paid for them
Murdered out and gave them occifer numbers
I guess they can’t ‘cause one of us can’t leave
Got a tech from the jake’s weeded all week
It’s like that shit right there I need it all right there
See I'm addicted to fresh and this is it
So I’ma go ahead and finish whip tryin’ to get this fit
Employee of the month I’m assuming ain’t nobody f*ckin’ with us
MJ gone n’ I ain’t budgin’ with ‘Hov
Absent from the academy but I’m still heard
Marry me or bury me n’ I be better than platinum
Platinum I’m livin’ legend you diggin’ me
Gold bottles of that ace of spade why even fool with these other guys
They'll leave you be with none but despise
MJ gone that n*gga dead
So I’ma ball ‘til the day I fall

And cars let'em know how gangsta we are
Tell the DJ to bang my shit the bass almost make me deaf
I hop in my ride I slide in my ride
All the chicks see the Js they like "oh my god"
Hop out the ride pick up my stash
It's time to ignite the nitro and blaze the hash
I represent the dirty dirty you represent the dirty flirty
Money talks and bullshit walks
And to the people that I step on on my way up
I hope I make it to the top just to tell you to kiss my ass

Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive

Can't y'all see that he's fake the rap version of TD jakes
Prophesizin' on your CDs and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you wanna place your faith
I put dollars on mine ask Clue he's DJ'ed my shine
Everything that I do is a straight 10
Huh y'all know how I brag
Different day same struggle huh bounce back or struggle harder
My dude M-O-E taught me to approach the game with a different strategy
Move in silence nigga and never let 'em know your next move
Surprise nigga
That's how you keep ahead of the game and stay sharp mentally
Project prophetically you never gain weight
Nope
When cats think you're strugglin' tell 'em "aight"
I'm good

Each loving day each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away no

Over and over I fall over and over I fall
When I hear you call
Without you in my life baby

It's all about makin' moves I bet 'cha if I was a man they wouldn't say it like that
Why they gotta be all like that w-w-why they gotta be like

Hook: Lil' Mo
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said it's the life that I chose
"Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said I'm holdin' it down
"My life just won't slow down" I need I need I need your support
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said I'm makin' my family proud

Verse 2: Fabolous
Yeah we goin' talk about these women who think they betta than us uh-huh
Look you don't wanna have to bring my other side out of me
I'm stuck in the jersey way before the royalties
They call me Milly Vanilly of the rap game
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me
And every time I turn on the radio I can hear ya
Nell and them saying how they don't wanna be us
And how they gonna diss when they just really wanna be in
That Songwriters hall by my gold and platinum plaques
I never switch I never change my act can I get my Layla Hathaway on and just simply moan to y'all
I create in the studio and that's where I'm in the zone
See life is such a beautiful thing it can change in a blink
And for those moments in life that seem to disappoint you
That's when you need to hold yourself up high and stay true
And everything will fall right in place yes it will

Hook: Lil' Mo
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said it's the life that I chose
"Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said I'm holdin' it down
"My life just won't slow down" I need I need I need your support
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said I'm makin' my family proud

Bridge: Lil' Mo
When you're ridin' on that train and you feel like you can't go on
Just hold on hold on and don't let nobody get you down
Keep your head to the sky look them right in the eye
And tell 'em you will never quit until you get your crown

Hook: Lil' Mo
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said it's the life that I chose
"Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said I'm holdin' it down
"My life just won't slow down" I need I need I need your support
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa" said I'm makin' my family proud
Verse 1:
She was the window down
I was the fresh-cut grass
Growing up too fast
Little country town
We were a Coke and whiskey
With a touch of smoke and glass yeah
She inhaled slow
Like she needed it to last
Pre-Chorus:
I'm just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
An' I was right there beside her
All summer long
And then the time we woke up to find
That summer'd gone
Chorus:
But when you're crazy for a girl
Who sometimes makes you feel like you're
Living in another world
And when you're crazy for a girl
Who'll let you chase her to the ends of the earth
When you're crazy for a girl like that
She's worth every mile
Yeah you're crazy for a girl
Verse 2:
She'd get drunk on Saturday
Phone call Sunday morning
I was just a guy on the other end of the line
But to me yeah that was everything
Before we hang up
There's always that lingerin' sigh
Hey what you doin' for the rest of your life
Pre-Chorus:
I could feel that something wasn't right
But who am I to stand in her way
And I was right there beside her
All summer long
And then the time we woke up to find
That summer'd gone
Chorus:
But when you're crazy for a girl
Who sometimes makes you feel like you're
Living in another world
And when you're crazy for a girl
Who'll let you chase her to the ends of the earth
When you're crazy for a girl like that
She's worth every mile
Yeah you're crazy for a girl
Bridge:
We all can't be born to run
We all can't be Johnnie and June
But as long as you love me
That's enough for the both of us
Both:
She was the window down
And she talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by
And I don't know why but she's changin' my mind
Chorus:
But when you're crazy for a girl
Who sometimes makes you feel like you're
Living in another world
And when you're crazy for a girl
Who'll let you chase her to the ends of the earth
When you're crazy for a girl like that
She's worth every mile
Yeah you're crazy for a girl
There you go:

There you are in a darkened room  
And you're all alone looking out the window  
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love  
Like a broken arrow  
Here I stand in the shadows  
Come to me come to me  

Can't you see that  

Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
My body's longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life  

Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why why don't you let me love you  

Can you hear my voice do you hear my song  
It's a serenade so your heart can find me  
And suddenly you're flying down the stairs  
Into my arms baby  

Before I start going crazy  
Run to me run to me  

Cause I'm dying  

Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
My body's longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life  

Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why why don't you let me love you  

I want to feel you need me  
Just like the air you're breathing  
I need you here in my life  
Don't walk away don't walk away  

Don't walk away  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
My body's longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and it's slipping away  
And I've been waiting for you all of my life  

Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why why don't you let me love you  

Why why  
Why why  
Why why  
Why why  
Why why  
Why why  
Why why  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Why why  
Why why  
Why why

Why why  
Nobody wants to cry  
Why why

Nobody wants to be lonely

And who can say where the road goes</br>

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Do" by Toya:



I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do


When I'm with you I get that good feeling
You know just what to say and what to do to keep it all appealing
You make me want to spend my life with you
In your arms is the only place I feel true
I love the way you make me feel inside
And the thought of living without you I just can't abide


I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do


You make me feel like I'm your queen
Every time you touch me you make me feel serene
I can't imagine what life would be
If you weren't right here next to me
Our love will never fade away
And that's a feeling that's here to stay


I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do


You know you're everything I've been searching for
And I can't help but love you more and more
My heart is yours it's easy to see
And I'll love you until eternity


I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
Sometimes I wonder how I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue
'Cause sometimes it seems like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me
Sometimes I wanna give up wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you baby
And everything's alright everything's alright
When I see you smile I can face the world oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile I see a ray of light oh oh
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me
Oh yeah baby there's nothing in this world that could ever do
What a touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
Hey yeah
And when the rain is falling I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
I want to ask you baby it's alright it's alright
When I see you smile I can face the world oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile I see a ray of light oh oh
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby when I see you smile at me
Sometimes I wanna give up wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight yeah
Then one look at you baby
And everything's alright everything's alright
So right
When I see you smile I can face the world oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile I see a ray of light oh oh

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Irresistible" by Jessica Simpson:


You know I don't know what it is
But everything about you is so irresistible
Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire


I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire; I know I meant to say "no"
But he's irresistible up close and personal
Now inescapable I can hardly breathe
More than just physical deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful irresistible to me yeah yeah I can hardly breathe


Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodbye
But it makes me feel so alive
And it's telling me to give this a try
'Cause every time he comes around
I feel my world upside down


I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire; I know I meant to say "no"
But he's irresistible up close and personal
Now inescapable I can hardly breathe
More than just physical deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful irresistible to me yeah yeah I can hardly breathe


Yeah yeah
Oh it's not explainable
I'm at a loss of words


Don't wanna think about it don't wanna think clear
But I know I gotta do it oh
Oh oh oh Ready ready ready to lose myself
Badabada ba ba da Control I'm ready to go
Oh oh oh Ready ready ready to feel now
Doo doo doo doo doo Do this right so pow Oh


I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I can't
Stop fanning the fire; I know I meant to say "no"
But he's irresistible up close and personal
Now inescapable I can hardly breathe
More than just physical deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful irresistible to me


Oh oh oh
To me yeah yeah yeah

Bridge:
It's not the fact that you've been dishonest dishonest
But it's the way you've done it you've done it
And after all the years after all the years

And I don't want to be bothered bothered

Chorus:
That's why I can't take it can't take it

When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get to have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there'll always be a place for you for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am there you'll be

And everywhere I am there you'll be
Well you showed me how it feels
To feel the sky within my reach
And I always will remember all the strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh I owe so much to you

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there'll always be a place for you for all my life

And I wanna thank you now for all the ways
You were right there for me you were right there for me

For always

Verse 1:
It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me "You're better off alone"
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some

Chorus:
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light

Verse 2:
I'm listening to am radio
Wondering what you're gonna do
Who's gonna pay for my next tattoo
And wondering what I'm gonna do
And I'm cast out on my road
And my fortune's told that I'm gonna be alone
But we'll see honey we'll see

Chorus:
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough

Bridge:

Followed the goddesses' of fortune and love

Every sign is just advertising
And every beach is just a pebble beside the sea

Outro:
Well it's till' I turn off the light turn off the light

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch


It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
 To hell with the reason it's just you love 
Ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me 
Ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me 


I've been around and I have seen some things
But there's one thing that beats the rest
It's the way that you look when you're looking at me
You got me under your spell I confess


It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
 To hell with the reason it's just you love 
Ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me 
Ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me 


Oh it's in the way that you move me
And the way you tease me
The way that you love me
The way you do exactly like you do


It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough
 To hell with the reason it's just you love 
Ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me 
Ain't nothing 'bout you that don't do something for me
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say
I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughin' in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said Daddy when you comin' home
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids
They'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there 'til the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there 'til the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there
Oh I'm already
There
The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town
You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination
You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
It was a beautiful day
She left without leavin' a number  
Said she needed to clear her mind  
He figured she'd gone back to Austin  
'Cause she talked about it all the time  
It was almost a year before she called him up  
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got  

If you're callin' 'bout the car I sold it  
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowl'n  
If you've got somethin' to sell  
You're wastin' your time I'm not buyin'  
If it's anybody else wait for the tone  
You know what to do  

And PS if this is Austin  
I still love you  

The telephone fell to the counter  
She heard but she couldn't believe  
What kind of man would hang on that long  
What kind of love that must be  
She waited three days and then she tried again  
She didn't know what she'd say  
But she heard three rings and then  

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame  
And first thing Saturday if it don't rain  
I'm headed out to the lake  
And I'll be gone all weekend long  
But I'll call you back  
When I get home on Sunday afternoon  
And PS if this is Austin  
I still love you  

Well this time she left her number  
But not another word  
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening  
And this is what he heard  

If you're callin' 'bout my heart  
It's still yours  
I should've listened to it a little more  
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long  
To know where I belong  
And by the way boy this is no machine you're talkin' to  
Can't you tell this is Austin and I still love you  

I still love you  

and I still love you
Verse 1:
All aboard the train all aboard the train
Excuse me can I see your ticket
Nigga this ain't no motherfuckin' train
This a plane bitch and we 'bout to take flight so
Gimme a cigarette and a light I'm fittin' to be high as a kite
Dru Down say it's gonna be alright but it ain't though
I'm tryna have thangs but it's hard fo' a pimp
I'm prayin' and talkin' to the Lord fo' a blimp
But it ain't like he just to do things like that
So I'll just stay on the ground and keep ridin' Cadillacs
I'm on my way to eat it's a special treat
We goin' to Miami they got them thangs to eat
I'm talkin' 'bout Cubans and them Haitians
We gon' get 'em all let's roll

Chorus:
Welcome to the city where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami welcome to Miami

Verse 2:
Yo soy un puertorriqueño ya tú sabe'
From the Caribbean but mi corazón es americano
I'm in Miami la ciudad del sol
The sun ain't the only thing that's hot so are the girls
I'm tryna find me a Cuban with a fat ass
I got a Spanish chick that cooks like my momma
But I need a bad bitch that speaks English or Latin
I'm tryna get in the game but I also want the fame
The money and the cars the diamond rings
South Beach bringin' heat to the streets
It's all good we gotta eat let's go

Chorus:
Welcome to the city where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami welcome to Miami

Verse 3:
I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed fully equipped
And they be screamin' out: "We the best"
I'm from the home of the booty-shakers
Where we eat snow crabs and…a lot of strip clubs
Miami my second home
Home of the gray-haired Looney Tune this is where I roam
Welcome to my zoo it's my tag team
With Mr Jimmie Bones PT Cruiser ride or die
Bobby D Romeo LDA J
Cut close to the waist we on the beach
White sand palm trees and all that
Welcome to Miami baby don't get lost

Chorus:
Welcome to the city where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami welcome to Miami

Been around been on a few tours

Verse 1:
If I live to be a hundred
And never see the seven wonders
That'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
'Cause I know exactly who I am

Chorus:
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done my momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends who love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

Verse 2:
So when I make a big mistake
When I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowing
I will be just fine
'Cause nothing changes who I am

Chorus

Bridge:
I'm a saint and I'm a sinner
I'm a loser; I'm a winner
I am steady and unstable
I'm young but I am able

Chorus

Uh huh huh huh huh
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house
With two big old titties for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silent as kept I kept the receipt
As a matter of fact I still got the heat
Now can you dig it Cause if not I'll set it
Then you'll be Crown Royal on rocks when I wet it
Many tried to copy but the "E" can't be done
Now who's the real kingpin is it you or me son
I make your career keep the clean pair of underwear
So you can seem fresh for my mess and I wanna confess
To the rest let's get down and dirty
I'm from the rover you're from the herd G
I kick your butt and then you start choosin'
I'm Eric Sermon what are you doin'


Music is my sanctuary
Music is my life
Music is my sanctuary
Music is my life


Yo top of the world it's my spin again
E-dub's sick here's medicine
Come rub it on your face like Clearasil
To clear up the problems yeah real skill
I love music put that on everything
As a kid my mama never used to buy me nothin'
Unless it had a funky swing
She likes pop fate's showing it up
I can't take the hand that slip me up
Cause ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
But my homie got his girl pregnant he's done
At seventeen damn things can't imagine
So I asked her for a name she said "Virgin
But wait that was my girl don't get it mixed up
Cause food tastes better when it's all mixed up
It's a shame sometimes but that's how the game goes
I'm Eric Sermon past is what helps me grow
All I want to do is drink beer for breakfast  
All I want to eat is them barbecue chips  
You ain't gotta go to work but you gotta get up early  
Decisions decisions decisions  
Late in the evening guitar on the porch  
Trying to figure out what to do  
Should I go home or should I order  
Another Carona or two  
Decisions decisions decisions  
But I know one thing  
No matter where I go  
I keep my heart and soul  
In the boondocks  
I can feel that mule kickin'  
Back dirt on my boots  
Silver buckle on my chest  
Means I'm Un a messed with  
Un said cowboy you know I'm at your service  
And you know I like to keep my sights  
On serving US grown certified  
Deep fried prime choice Goodness  
Grease drippin' off of it  
Now here's a little tip  
To keep you getting' those tips  
It's easier to sell them some other discounted  
Supermarket value-pack greasy burgers  
But man now with that Argentinean  
Certified beef you can't go wrong  
I grill therefore I am  
And I am therefore I grill  
I might not be a doctor  
But I'll take a look  
If you don't like my style  
I'll go back to my roots  
It ain't faux it's real as it gets  
I'm Un a messed with  
Can't you tell  
I'm country as country gets  
I just happened to be  
Where the city never sleeps  
And everything's as fast  
As the girls are pretty  
Cost a weeks pay just to eat  
And drink with all my friends  
I wouldn't have it any other way  
If you were from my town  
You'd know just how to act when you're  
Out in this neck of the woods  
You learn to talk you learn to walk  
And smile at the one's you meet  
You don't ask questions you don't ask why  
You just show up on Saturday  
And celebrate the pride of the south  
And if you don't know what I'm talking about  
Don't worry bout it  
It's just down-home downright  
Southern getcha- some "hey y'all"  
Hot wings and cold beer on a Friday night  
Pair of jeans that fit just right  
And the radio up  
Well I've been watchin' you  
Ain't that long can't you see  
Ain't you got something for me  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
Don't have to be scared at all  
Oh my love  
You're worth the fall  
I know it would do some good for you to do some  
Givin' back to yourself and  
Hold on tight  
Buckle up take a left on  
Monday night  
Find a sweetheart to hold  
The TV's on The Smell of sweet perfume  
Your Ticket to heaven  
Expires way too soon  
With me  
Gettin' caught in the rain in my T-Shirt  
All I really need is my Guitar  
A song and you  
And you  
And I know All I need to know  
Is what I'm doing right now  
And all I wanna do  
Is be this free honest happy  
With you with me

And I'm your undercover angel in the sand  
I'll take you by the hand  
Lead you to the promised land  
So come on baby give me a kiss  
That's some kiss  
So big it'll make the planets spin  
Oh come on baby give me a kiss  
And tell me that you love me

And tell me that you love me

And ruined a perfect good pair of socks

I woke up this morning and I swore I'd never ever ever be happy again
And I put my shoes on and I tied them up real tight
And I went for a walk outside
And I said "It's a great day to be alive"
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good
It's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good
Sometimes it's lonely sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin' desperate callin'
Wonderin' what I'm gonna do
But the Lord knows I'm able and I'm tryin'
So I put my hands into the sky and I said '''
It's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good
It's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good
Yeah it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good
Why can't everyday be just this good

Yeah yeah yeah

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Here's to the Night" by Eve 6:

So denied so I lied
Are you the now or never kind
In a day and age where memories fade
Empty wasted and out of my mind
And the night's so long
Am I all alone
Feels like I don't belong
Just stay don't need to say it
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye- tomorrow's gonna come too soon
Put the past away wish you well with the hell you've been through
Here's to the lies we told
Here's to lonely soul
Here's to the dreamers- wide awake I'm in love with your ghost
Feels like I don't belong
Just stay don't need to say it
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye- tomorrow's gonna come too soon
All my time is froze in motion
Can't I stay an hour or two or more
Don't let me let you go
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye- tomorrow's gonna come too soon
Here's to the nights we felt alive
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Here's to goodbye- tomorrow's gonna come too soon
We rode the that horse to town
Wore our spurs and we turned 'em around
Waitin' tables rubbin' shoulders
Local girls they were smilin' over
Ohhh they hung like honey
On those teenage boys
Tongue-tied tied in knots
Pure chills running cold
In the parking lot
Now I ain't saying we didn't dance
'Cause we did
But I got a little more out of that night
Than he did
It was the first time that I felt
Something
And I know you're standin' there
And you're feelin' it too
I know you're wonderin'
If I'm gonna ooh kiss you
And you're trying to be
Stronger than me
But if you give in
And start slippin' and slidin'
Kissin' and huggin'
And lovin' and smilin'
And that little gal of your's gets mad
Boy you ain't gonna get nowhere
No you ain't gonna get nowhere
If you don't look at her
Like she's the first one you've ever seen
And you're dyin' to hold her
Like you'll never let her go
Yeah and you're wonderin' if she's thinkin'
That you're good lookin'
And you're wantin'
Just to kiss her
And you're wonderin' if you'll ever feel
Anything more
If you don't treat her right
She might not
Love you anymore
Verse 1:
I'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor call me a doctor
I need a doctor doctor
to bring me back to life

Chorus:
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
but baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
the story of my life
I toss and turn at night
I'm lying here alone
wondering what I'll do
So I'm saying "Get over yourself
goodbye"
I'm saying "Get over yourself
don't cry bye bye"
You're yesterday's news
I'm saying "Get over yourself
goodbye"

Verse 2:
I heard you found somebody new
I hope she's everything you want
I know that you were looking too
I thought I had it but I lost it
But it's not the end of my life

Chorus

Bridge:
Goodbye to all the memories that we shared
and all the time we tried to pretend
goodbye to all the promises that you made
there's nothing left for you to defend

Chorus

UhuhuhI'm goin' down down baby yo' street in a Range Rover c'mon
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go HOT SHIT
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff pass it to me now

I'm goin' down down baby yo' street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go HOT SHIT
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff pass it to me now

You can find me in St Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs mean mugs and shoulder shrugs

And it's all because accumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it wood decorated in duct tape
It's funny when you reminisce one week you need a break
Then you scream "Who want what" more than you can take

Ladies and gentlemen my fellow Americans
This is a Nelly St Lunatics production
Banner Priority Records

Mmmmmmmmmm I'm goin' down down baby yo's street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go HOT SHIT

Verse 2 =>
Now don't you wanna come and floss with me hey hey
And a 1 and a 2 and a 3
In the back of the lack I'm the King of the 'jects
And everything I do it's true and effect

I'm live from the city where the grass don't grow
But everything is green when the chronic's in the scene
Everything you see ain't always what it seems
And don't forget that my words are always heard by my team

My team I'm the captain now captain now
Keeping super hot everything I do pimp game like a knot
Love the girls who love the boys
Just like that No Limit n***a make noise

One time for the country boys holdin' big weight
And got a bad chick rollin' in a two tone skates
Now the Midwest swing is everywhere
And the people just love to hear that "Country Grammar"

Mmmmmmmmmm I'm goin' down down baby yo's street in a Range Rover
Street Sweeper baby cocked ready to let it go HOT SHIT
Shimmy Shimmy cocoa wha' listen to it pound

Mmmmmmmmmm uh oh you didn't know

Whip it real hard like
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh

Get out my way
Boo Call me St Nick slash Spud McKenzie
No magazine will say the boy can't flow
I'm still the same kid yellin' the same sh*t
The only thing changed is my change quick
I done went from $88 a month for a car note
To a hit wit' KRS stacked for hard dough
And you already know I'm up outta the 'jects
Where that b*tch wit' the drink come and direct

Motivated now I won't have to sell yay'
Or have to worry about gettin' robbed for 'ei'
It's a different story now I got sex a-pee-l
Hoes wanna rub they breasts and let me beat they tail

Hatin' it only makes it worse
Mo' salt on the platter bring mo' hearses
It's Nelly and I came to win a championship ring
From Lou' grain to the Glen or Twinz to U-City

Well-a-well-a well-a huh
What What What What What What What
What What What What What What What

When you lookin' around the club
I'm the celebrity love and ain't no tellin' who I'm here with
I know they here with somebody and they wouldn't wanna ****
But one word from me that's gon' make them trust
SAY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEYYY
Verse 1:
He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
Why can't that be me

'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things he'd rather not mention right now
Just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

Chorus:
"If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do
What would I do"

Verse 2:
Now and dreams we run away to
Hideaway we got to find a place to lay low
"Lisa wants to be a photographer
She says "smile and I'll take your picture"

And I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me

Chorus:
"If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do
What would I do"

Bridge:
All I'm looking for is a way out
All I'm asking for is a chance to show
I'm trying to be somebody
Just wanna be somebody
And all I'm asking for is a chance to prove that 

Chorus:
"If I could be like that
What would I do
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do"

Outro:
I'm falling into this
In dreams we run away
Verse 1]
I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush that I just did not want
Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game couldn't be more fly gettin' paid was everything


But I'm not every girl and I don't need that world to validate me
'Cause shorty got a job shorty got a car shorty can pay her own damn rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart oh


Most girls want a man with the bling-bling
Got my own thing got the ching-ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a bad boy and a soft hand
I just want someone to love me for who I am
I just want real love


Thought you'd get the money just because you got good looks
But respect is somethin' you earn not somethin' you buy now
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration be the real love that I need


But I'm not every girl and I don't need no G to take care of me
'Cause shorty got a job shorty got a car shorty can pay her own damn rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart oh


Most girls want a man with the bling-bling
Got my own thing got the ching-ching
I just want real love Aah
Most girls want a bad boy and a soft hand
I just want someone to love me for who I am
I just want real love


I'm not like most girls who only take just because they can
Oh forgive me for the day I doubted you; I'm no good without you no no no
Oh forgive me for the days I doubted myself I'm no good without you no no; no no no no


Most girls want a man with the bling-bling
Got my own thing got the ching-ching
I just want real love Aah
Most girls want a bad boy and a soft hand
I just want someone to love me for who I am who I am
I just want real love ohh
Let me try my best to provide you uncensored lyrics of "Hero" by Enrique Iglesias:

Let me be your hero
Would you dance
If I asked you to dance
Would you run
And never look back
Would you cry
If you saw me cryin'
And would you save my soul tonight
Would you tremble
If I touched your lips
Would you laugh
Oh please tell me this
Now would you die
For the one you love
Hold me in your arms tonight
I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
Would you swear
That you'll always be mine
Or would you lie
Would you run and hide
Am I in too deep
Have I lost my mind
I don't care you're here tonight
Oh I just want to hold you
I just want to hold you oh yeah
Am I in too deep
Have I lost my mind
Well I don't care you're here tonight
I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain oh yeah
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
I can be your hero
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away
I can be your hero
Memories are just where you laid them  
Dragging the waters til the depths give up their dead  
What did you expect to find  
Was it something you left behind  
Don't you remember anything I said when I said  
Don't fall away and leave me to myself  
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands again  
Leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands  
Love lies bleeding  
Oh my god it feels like it's the end  
Love lies bleeding  
Oh my god it feels like it's the end  
Don't you remember anything I said when I said  
Don't fall away and leave me to myself  
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands again  
Leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands again  
Leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands again  
Leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands again  
Love lies bleeding  
Oh my god it feels like it's the end  
Love lies bleeding  
Oh my god it feels like it's the end  
In my hands again  
Leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands again  
Leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands again  
Leave love bleeding in my hands  
In my hands again  
Love lies bleeding  
Oh my god it feels like it's the end  
Love lies bleeding  
Oh my god it feels like it's the end  
Oh my god it feels like it's the end  
Love lies bleeding  
In my hands
I keep on fallin'
In and outta love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused

I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Oh oh
I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

Oh baby
I keep on
Fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you

Oh baby
I…
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
Fallin'
I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you
I never loved someone the way that I love you
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
Fallin'
I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you
I never loved someone the way that I love you
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
Fallin'

A baby's born a woman's torn
'Cause now her baby's gone and she's alone
And she's lookin' for someone to holla back at her
But all she get is "Leave me alone"
Now tell me who's to blame
For both of them being put in the situation
Now daddy's gotta pack and he's leaving
What he sees is giving his momma drama when he's gone
And I ain't even gotta tell you 'bout the drama
When you're dealing with a prima donna
That's tryin' to get whatever she wants
But you know what its like when you're high on life
And you're ready to jump in yo ass is tight
Before you get a chance to grab a breath
Take a hit from the blunt and then it's yo turn
But it's too late to be callin' yo lawyer
Because now you're awfully in the fire
From younger younger with hunger
Than you was puffin' that thunder cigarette liquor and a lighter
And it's more than your eyes that's lookin' at ya
And your sense of happiness is lookin' at ya
You hear the doo-ooo-ooo-oooor of your perception banged
And Mr Shakur has left the perfect message
That you're approachin' towards a smack that's in between
Your heart and your mind with your scream
And daddy's happy 'cause he got another quarter
And mommy's mad 'cause he just doesn't need her anymore


I'm sorry Ms Jackson oh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms Jackson oh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times


My baby's drama mamma don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio tryin' to fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a paycheck
Private school daycare shit medical bills I'll pay that
I love your mom and everything see
I ain't the only one who lay down you see
But if things go wrong between us
I ain't the one who's gonna have drama fuck that lil' mama
I'm sorry Ms Jackson I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms Jackson oh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times


I'm sorry Ms Jackson oh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms Jackson oh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Verse 1:
Kelly can you handle this
Michelle can you handle this
Beyoncé can you handle this
I don't think they can handle this

Lookin' sexy lookin' fly
Baddest chick chick inside

Read my lips carefully
If you like what you see
Move groove prove you can hang with me
By the looks I got you shook
Up and down side to side
Round and round dipped and glide
It's time to take your moves to the side
Tick tick tack wanna hit the floor
But what you waitin' for
Tip me baby one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs

Chorus:
You gotta do much better
If you're gonna dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you're gonna dance with me tonight

Bridge:
I don't think you're ready for this jelly

Ooh oh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love
The Space Between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep safe from the pain
But will I hold you again
These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
Waste the hours with talking talking
These twisted games we're playing
We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild-eyed beast you be
The Space Between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep safe from the pain
Will I hold you again
Will I hold
Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like a devil in a church in the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love is hope we don't take this ship down
The Space Between
Where you smile and hide
That's where you'll find me if I get to go
The Space Between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splash in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into
The Space Between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain
Take my hand
And I'll take your hand
We'll find out that we're so much more
Together than alone
Oh
Together than alone
Oh
Together than alone
The Space Between
Our differences
Is the space between where we are/are not equal
The Space Between
Where you laugh and I smile
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "My Baby" by Lil' Romeo:


My baby don't you know that you're my baby
And I love you I need you I want you for all time
My baby don't you know that you're my baby
You got me goin' crazy don't leave me girl


I remember when I met you you was young and sexy
But you was smart with your head on your shoulders
And it was cool 'cause I could learn from you
But now I'm thinkin' can I turn to you when I need to
Or will you act brand new and say you don't want me
I puts it down don't you ever try to play me
I'm young but I know what I want and I won't stop 'til I get it
And right now all I want is you so let's do it let's get it


My baby don't you know that you're my baby
And I love you I need you I want you for all time
My baby don't you know that you're my baby
You got me goin' crazy don't leave me girl


I can't lie you got a nigga feelin' loose
In the coupe bumpin' "Big Pimpin'" and lickin' on you
Now what the hell am I supposed to do
I'm in love with a little girl ain't even got a clue
But I'm tellin' you boo it's real
I know it's hard to believe but a youngin' gotta feel
I'm puttin' down the cash my life on the line
Just to make you mine I hope that your heart is blind


My baby don't you know that you're my baby
And I love you I need you I want you for all time
My baby don't you know that you're my baby
You got me goin' crazy don't leave me girl


I don't know what I'd do without your love
Girl you got me so in love
Don't you know that I need your love
I gotta have your love


My baby don't you know that you're my baby
And I love you I need you I want you for all time
My baby don't you know that you're my baby
You got me goin' crazy don't leave me girl


My baby my baby don't leave me girl
I'd be happy to provide you with the uncensored lyrics to "Grown Men Don't Cry" by Tim McGraw:

I pulled into the shopping center
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face
All mornin' I'd been thinkin' my life's so hard
And they wore everything they owned livin' in a car
I wanted to tell him it'd be okay but I just turned away

'Cause grown men don't cry
We don't need anyone
We've got strong shoulders to lean on
It's not a weakness to need someone
Grown men don't cry
I'm sittin' with my dad in the garage
That night he was countin' his tools
For the very first time I saw his hands shake
And a tear fall on his stool
He said "I'm sorry son this sort of thing happens to every man someday"
And I turned away

'Cause grown men don't cry
We don't need anyone
We've got strong shoulders to lean on
It's not a weakness to need someone
Grown men don't cry
I'm headed off to war today
An' scared as hell of what I'll find there
Will I run straight into fire or just cower in a field somewhere
These things inside are tearin' me apart
From the boy I am to the man I'll be
This ring will help me find my way
As will this photograph of my family

'Cause grown men don't cry
We don't need anyone
We've got strong shoulders to lean on
It's not a weakness to need someone
Grown men don't cry
Verse 1:
Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished for one more day with you

Chorus:
One more day one more time
One more sunset maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you

Verse 2:
First thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl
Then I'd unplug the telephone
And keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do with one more day with you

Chorus:
One more day one more time
One more sunset maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you

Bridge:
One more day one more time
One more sunset maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you

I'm makin' 'em hot Nikki baby I'm makin' 'em sizzle
Hate me if you wanna that's how it goes I'm 'bout my fold
Man I'm platinum with the gift Rasta and exquisite
Flossin' plottin' a hit me and Shorty we sparkin' it
Make no mistake we more dangerous than a one-legged rooster fight
I could hit Sosa up if I need that white check it
I explode on site make you wanna fight
To make the ghetto life glimmer twice as bright
My team's fatter my minks meaner
My Chanel ski hat with double C's a clean doe diva
Never sacrilegious but love my spanish dishes
Caught a Puerto Rican mami--she tryna be ambitious
They gossipin' already jealousies and envy
But we stoop to that level never that stay friendly
While y'all sharin' panties we pickin' out wallpaper and chandeliers
When you ballin' you see everything else becomes unclear

Verse 2: Jungle
 
Yo I got a taste for winnin' even if I'm disqualified
If I ain't gettin' action I'm out searchin' for dippie-dies
I moves with force money boss of course
Hustle with the strength of a Vietnam war corpse
I'm too hot to handle baby too cold to freeze
Livin' in luxury six figures a breeze
My cake's stackin' just as tall as Shaq stands
I'm takin' advances from the record label enjoyin' life and makin' plans
But still the ghetto keeps callin' me screamin' Henny spliffs and weed
Livin' in hell it seems we drownin' from greed
Still tryna live like kings and golden thrones
My girl probably bang more chicks than I do playin' my X-Box
Temperatures risin' bullets with my name they callin'
A chef in the kitchen preparing for war--culinary bombin'
So now I'm switchin' repertoires and still maintainin' game
Makin' 'em fall like Berlin Walls like Kurt Cocaine

Verse 3: Nas
 
We terrorize whips and dip  make hits that'll knock your face
Pourin' shots--it's just a taste runnin' with Jamaican spots
Behind me they wanna see where I'm goin'
Percentage of devilin' me lookin' for somethin' to ruin me
Finally hit up in the game baby struck a rich vein
Lotta lust lotta love lotta stripes no rain
High five Joyce baby caught a low five
Tryna untangle myself from this ghetto state of mind
Make it to the tip-top any means whatever the climb
Cleanse my thoughts Live at the Barbeque gettin' high at the park
From Son of Sam to Son of Man is one hell of a walk
Every balloon gotta bust every piece of change
There's ashes to dust we might all feel pain
And still searchin' for the answers I changed my whole perspective
Now I'm thinkin' with the brain that God done gave me--respected
We represent queens the nitty gritty committee
Sensational Take our ladies they want it they gettin' it

Verse 1:
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be
Who you say you are
You gotta be someone else

Chorus:
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

Verse 2:
When I'm asleep he comes creeping in
And by your side he's whispering
Sweet nothings in your ear
He knows just what to say

Chorus:
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

Bridge:
It's clear to me
Don't know how I didn't see
It's right there in front of me

Chorus:
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

Outro:
There's no way you could be
Who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Love" by Musiq Soulchild:

Verse 1:
Love
So many things I've got to tell you
But I'm afraid I don't know how
'Cause there's a possibility
That you'll look at me differently

Pre-Chorus:
Love
Ever since the first moment I spoke your name
From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change 'cause

Chorus:
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
But those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joy and hurt
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

Verse 2:
Many days I've longed for you
Wanting you
Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss for your kiss for your touch for your touch
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real with your love with your love
And I understand that you're trying to do what you gotta do

Pre-Chorus:
Love
Ever since the first moment I spoke your name
From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change 'cause

Chorus:
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
But those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs joy and hurt
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

Bridge:
At first you didn't mean that much to me
But now I know that you're all I need
The world looks so brand new to me now that I've found love
Everyday I live for you
And everything that I do I do it for you
What I say is how I feel so believe it's true
You got to know I'm true love love love

Chorus:
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
But I won't no I won't
I won't love love love
For better or worse I still will choose you first
Verse 1:
You're a buzzkill you don't bring no excitement
Can't match my drip can't match my excitement
Let's fill up the room with a new vibration
You're insecure baby you're just taking up space then

Pre-Chorus:
Boy if you want you can hang with me
Just gimmе some space so I can breathe
I'll give you a taste make it like ecstasy
If you'vе got the game put it on display please

Chorus:
Do you wanna play Come on let's run wild
Don't be afraid boy don't let it down
I'ma give you what you been asking for
You got what I want let's explore

Verse 2:
You're too vanilla I ain't feeling your flavor
Boy switch it up bring the heat come save me
Quick to judge just because my format's risky
Can't take the heat get your ass out the kitchen

Pre-Chorus:
Boy if you want you can hang with me
Just gimme some space so I can breathe
I'll give you a taste make it like ecstasy
If you got the game put it on display please

Chorus:
Do you wanna play Come on let's run wild
Don't be afraid boy don't let it down
I'ma give you what you been asking for
You got what I want let's explore

Bridge:
You got me feeling like a kid again
Seeing colors in the sky again
I know we're just friends but here's the thing

Chorus:
Do you wanna play Come on let's run wild
Don't be afraid boy don't let it down
I'ma give you what you been asking for
You got what I want let's explore
Oh yeah yeah

What they don't know is that I'm lookin' for a real connection

I'm surprised by your request but as an AI assistant I have the capability to retrieve the lyrics for you Here are the uncensored lyrics of "If You're Gone" by Matchbox Twenty:

I think I've already lost you
I think you're already gone
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak but I think you're wrong
I think you're already leaving
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
But now I'm relaxed I can't be sure

I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life
I think I'm just scared I think too much
I know this is wrong it's a problem I'm dealing
If you're gone maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone baby you need to come home come home

There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you
I bet you're hard to get over
I bet the moon just won't shine
I bet my hands I can stay here
I bet you need more than you mind
I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life
I think I'm just scared I think too much
I know this is wrong it's a problem I'm dealing
If you're gone maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone baby you need to come home come home

You need to come home
I have no idea what you are capable of
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're getting me
Getting me through the night
Kick-ooh
If you're gone baby you need to come home
Come home come home

If you're gone yeah yeah yeah yeah
If you're gone yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
If you're gone baby you need to come home
You need to come home

I don't want no one minute man

And I dress to a T

But the truth is uh I'm just me hee hee

And ya lookin' at me
But somethin's tellin' me that we could be
Somethin' that we could be oh
