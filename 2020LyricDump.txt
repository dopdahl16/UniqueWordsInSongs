Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty oh
No one's around to judge me oh
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said ooh I'm blinded by the lights
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said ooh I'm drowning in the night
Oh when I'm like this you're the one I trust
Hey hey hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive baby oh
The city's cold and empty oh
No one's around to judge me oh
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said ooh I'm blinded by the lights
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said ooh I'm drowning in the night
Oh when I'm like this you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know back to let you know
I could never say it on the phone say it on the phone
Will never let you go this time ooh

I said ooh I'm blinded by the lights
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey hey hey

I said ooh I'm blinded by the lights
No I can't sleep until I feel your touch

Oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now but know I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I try
You don't believe it we do this every time


Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away run away


I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away run away run away


Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away run away


Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me what you got to lose
Make up your mind tell me what are you gonna do
It's only me let it go


Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away run away
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"
Though it took some time to survive you

This bag is all I know that's why they need me on the court
Not long ago I was dancin' for dollars
No Spotify I hustled and sold the shit for an impala
Took in  they hired someone to handle it
They frame me just like them but they ain't on the scammin' shit
I'm blessed I ain't never need a chick to write hits
And when I die hope I somehow got the right kids
They all say that they real but they don't know what it is
I gotta keep a circle tight 'cause these niggas wanna snitch huh
This ain't nothin' that ya'll used to
I'm from the trenches I got the grind out the mud ooh
Sometimes I wish I could go back to when I was in school
Nowadays I got roommates who playing for keeps huh
Nowadays shit's all facade righteously
I keep my feelings and my pain paper chasin' with no frownin'
Yeah I'm tryna get paid drinkin' Gatorade

Yeah yeah
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Memories" by Maroon 5:

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you but I know I will one day yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday ayy ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say ayy

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back memories bring back you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo memories bring back memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember when I never felt so lost
When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop ooh yeah
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday ayy ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say ayy

Here's to the ones that we got oh oh
Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through no no
Toast to the ones here today aye
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way woah
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories aye aye
And the memories bring back memories bring back you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo memories bring back memories bring back you

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no no
Memories bring back memories bring back you

We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left but we're alright
Yeah life sure can try to put love through it but
We built this right so nothing's ever gonna move it


When the bones are good the rest don't matter
Yeah the paint could peel the glass could shatter
Let it break 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good


Call it dumb luck but baby you and I
Can't even mess it up although we both try
No it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing


When the bones are good the rest don't matter
Yeah the paint could peel the glass could shatter
Let it break 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good


Bones are good the rest the rest don't matter ooh
Bones are good the rest the rest don't matter
When the bones are good
When the bones are good


When the bones are good the rest don't matter
Yeah the paint could peel the glass could shatter
Let it break 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good


When the bones are good
Bones are good the rest the rest don't matter

You ain't coming out your shell you ain't really been yourself
Tell me what must I do do tell my love

Okay back to my session said "Don't you second guess baby you know"
Day to night to morning keep with me in the moment

You got to keep me focused you wanna say so
I hope she makes you miserable 
Like you made me oh 
I hope she turns your world 
Upside down like you did to me 
I hope you're happy right now 
Now that you're out of my life 
I hope she gives you something 
That you just can't leave 
And if it's love you're lookin' for 
I hope you find it 
But I hope you miss me 
I hope you miss me 
I hope you finally realize 
That you messed up 
And you need me 
And sometimes I think about you 
Late nights in the middle of June 
Heard a song we used to 
Listen to and it made me think of you 
And I don't know where you went 
But you're listenin' to this song 
And if the timing's right right right 
You might be thinkin' of me too 
And I don't know where you are 
But you're listenin' to my voice 
And if the timing's right right right 
You might be thinkin' of me too 
I hope she makes you feel lonely 
The way you always wanted me 
I hope you feel pretty pretty good 
About yourself 
Now that you broke every promise 
That you made to me 
I hope you're happy right now 
Now that you're bein' the guy you wanna be 
And if it's love you're lookin' for 
Then I hope you find it 
But I hope you miss me 
I hope you miss me 
I hope you finally find 
Someone who loves you 
Someone who's patient and kind 
And I hope she treats you too 
Good like you deserve 
But I hope you miss me 
I hope you miss me 
Thinking you could live without me 
Thinking you could live without me 
Baby I'm the one who put you up there

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly Fly
So I stepped off the Golden Golden
Nobody cried Cried cried cried cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care Might care might care

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up I see
You with me
And you say "As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear they don't deserve you"

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up I see
You with me
And you say "As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear they don't deserve ya"

If I knew it all then would I do it again
Would I do it again
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead
If I knew it all then would I do it again
Would I do it again
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead

Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling

You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling

Centre of attention whenever you want it baby
It's you in my reflection I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it baby
I would have stayed at home 'cause I was doing better alone
But when you said "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart

I wonder when you go if I stay on your mind
Two can play the game but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah you got me

You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling

Centre of attention whenever you want it baby
It's you in my reflection I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it baby
I would have stayed at home 'cause I was doing better alone
But when you said "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart

Ooh break my heart

I can provide the uncensored lyrics of "Señorita" by Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello Here they are:
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh I should be running
Ooh you keep me coming for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la yeah no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la yeah
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh I should be running
Ooh you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh I should be running
Ooh you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall oh
Ooh when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
All along I've been coming for ya
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya coming for ya coming for ya
For ya-na-na-na oh she loves it when I come
For ya-na-na-na
Oh I should be running
Oh you keep me coming for ya
No problem here are the uncensored lyrics to "Bad Guy" by Billie Eilish:

Verse 1:
White shirt now red my bloody nose
Sleeping you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say "thank you" or "please" I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul So cynical

Chorus:
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy duh

Verse 2:
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

Chorus:
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy duh

Bridge:
I'm only good at being bad bad

Verse 3:
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me
I mean I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

Chorus:
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy bad guy I'm a bad guy
Bad guy bad guy I'm a bad

Siempre picante todo lo que haces
Lo haces brillar baby eres una estrella
La forma en que bailas me tiene loco loco
Ya la noche se asoma y llegamos los grosos


Prepárate que llegamos
Y si de paso te dejamos
Nos seguimos moviendo
Escucha como va diciendo


Ritmo sudor y calor ¡Calor
Mis caderas no aguantan ¡No
La noche es de nosotros quédate a mi lado
Vamos a pegarnos como animales ¡Ah
Indecentes locos firmes oh-oh-oh-oh
Los bandidos con los terroristas oh-oh-oh-oh
Los grandes seguimos siendo los mismos oh-oh-oh-oh
Y yo sigo siendo el rey aunque no tenga reino


Tu cuerpo es un poema pintando en el cielo
Eres una geisha bienvenida a mi templo
La fiesta está que arde perreo hasta abajo
Lentos rápidos ilegales bailamos
Te llevo conmigo tienes mi corazón
Contigo soy sincero baby sin confusión
Tu belleza me inspira tus besos son mi motor
Créeme que tengo lo tuyo en papel de satin


Prepárate que llegamos
Y si de paso te dejamos
Nos seguimos moviendo
Escucha como va diciendo


Ritmo sudor y calor ¡Calor
Mis caderas no aguantan ¡No
La noche es de nosotros quédate a mi lado
Vamos a pegarnos como animales ¡Ah
Indecentes locos firmes oh-oh-oh-oh
Los bandidos con los terroristas oh-oh-oh-oh
Los grandes seguimos siendo los mismos oh-oh-oh-oh
Y yo sigo siendo el rey aunque no tenga reino


Tato dale Tato dale Tato dale hey
Tato dale Tato dale Tato dale hey
Tato dale Tato dale Tato dale hey
La familia cómo va familia hey
La familia cómo va familia hey


Prepárate que llegamos
Y si de paso te dejamos
Nos seguimos moviendo
Escucha como va diciendo


Ritmo sudor y calor ¡Calor
Mis caderas no aguantan ¡No
La noche es de nosotros quédate a mi lado
Vamos a pegarnos como animales ¡Ah
Indecentes locos firmes oh-oh-oh-oh
Los bandidos con los terroristas oh-oh-oh-oh
Los grandes seguimos siendo los mismos oh-oh-oh-oh
Y yo sigo siendo el rey aunque no tenga reino
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Heart on Ice" by Rod Wave:


SpeakerBangerz look alive
Lil Ju made this beat and I'ma tie my soul
Lost so many I'm like why I'm still here


I can't feel my legs Mmm
I'm a monster got no heart inside my chest Nah
In my safe I'm surrounded by the blues and the blacks Mmm
I'm a big dawg my nickname is "The Feds"
Uh huh they keep callin' for my head
Presidential saves on me I gotta keep 'em strapped
I don't know what's goin' on or what's goin' happen next
I'm a youngin raised by the old heads yeah


I felt like since a jit that I would die like John F Kennedy you know
All gunned down legends never really die No
Saya'all they did it for clout I don't think they know better
You know they would do it for clout we just call them clout chasers
Really they're just a bunch of pussies who ain't have no love for us
I gotta keep on keepin' on I'm trustin' God with this *****
They always askin' where Rubirosa know I love you brother
Got a relationship with God I feel like that's the only thing that's pushin' me
And it's a shame how we fell apart but **** it is what it is
We started off strong but it took a wrong turn it is what it is
You know I ain't never too proud to apologize for my *****
But I just be tryna stay focused and keep my mind on my work
And time movin' slow but really it's flyin' they say time waits for no man
And if you don't change your situation then you won't go where no man has ever gone


I can't feel my legs Mmm
I'm a monster got no heart inside my chest Nah
In my safe I'm surrounded by the blues and the blacks Mmm
I'm a big dawg my nickname is "The Feds"
Uh huh they keep callin' for my head
Presidential saves on me I gotta keep 'em strapped
I don't know what's goin' on or what's goin' happen next
I'm a youngin raised by the old heads yeah


I'm findin' new ways to cope
With depression that **** real uh
I battle with my thoughts and now I'm dealin' with this stressin' uh
Survivin' in the trenches know some **** tried to kill me huh
This **** here get deeper than the surface
Weigh heavy on my mental hurts
Got a sack inside my hand I'm tryna get to this money
Got a chopper inside my car you know some **** might jump off
And I feel like where I am and who I am I put a target on my back
My lifestyle it was chosen for me
And I ain't choose it for myself
My moms and dad they couldn't get along
But **** look how I turned out
I'm raisin' my son by myself I can't lie I need some help
One of my dawgs'll be home in 2022
I pray he do it right and get back to it
I was raised by the OGs in my home yeah


I can't feel my legs Mmm
I'm a monster got no heart inside my chest Nah
In my safe I'm surrounded by the blues and the blacks Mmm
I'm a big dawg my nickname is "The Feds"
Uh huh they keep callin' for my head
Presidential saves on me I gotta keep 'em strapped
I don't know what's goin' on or what's goin' happen next
I'm a youngin raised by the old heads yeah


In the sport where no one would go
With all this money still no one would know
Cause I got secrets and I got demons uh huh
But knowing that you're the reason for this pain in my heart
Makes me fearless undefeated uh huh

I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves


Now they're right upon me
Waitin' for me to breathe
And I try to make a sound
But they got me tongue-tied
And I can't believe it's been a while since I had somebody
So good so good


And I'm still rememberin' how it felt
And I'm tryin' to forget it now
And I know I shouldn't be complainin'
Complainin' yeah


Now they're right upon me
Waitin' for me to breathe
And I try to make a sound
But they got me tongue-tied
And I can't believe it's been a while since I had somebody
So good so good


They're all around me
Circling like a honeybee
I'm drownin' in them now I know you're the one I need


So I'll be brave for you
Stand tall for you
When you're gone I'll go
To to the ends of the earth for you


To to the ends of the earth
For you for you

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin' were you out drinkin'
Were you in the living room chilin' watchin' television


It's a quarter to midnight
And suddenly you're sayin' it
Didn't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
If the world was ending you'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it
All our fears would be irrelevant


If the world was ending you'd come over right
Right


I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the building started collapsing
I kinda thought you'd say something like "Oh no What's happening"
But you were nowhere to be found


It's a quarter to midnight
And suddenly you're sayin' it
Didn't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
If the world was ending you'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it
All our fears would be irrelevant


If the world was ending you'd come over right
Right


It's a quarter to midnight
And suddenly you're sayin' it
Didn't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
If the world was ending you'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it
All our fears would be irrelevant


If the world was ending you'd come over right
If the world was ending you'd come over right
If the world was ending
You'd come over right

The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind you might think
There's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got
Girl I don't

No I don't need no vacation
No fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home
Listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

And I got what I got
I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind you might think
There's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got
Girl I don't

No I don't
Oh oh-no
I said I don't
No I don't
Verse 1:
Feelin' good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feelin' blessed never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Chorus:
Every day can be a better day despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay uh-huh-huh-huh it's okay
It's okay uh-huh-huh-huh it's okay

Verse 2:
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away run away

Chorus:
Every day can be a better day despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay uh-huh-huh-huh it's okay
It's okay uh-huh-huh-huh it's okay

Bridge:
We're all just tryna find some meaning
In the things that we believe in
But we can't see the signs
Misleading us ooh

Verse 3:
So we'll take what comes
And we'll keep on going
Leaning on each other's shoulders
Then we'll find what we've been looking for

Chorus:
Every day can be a better day despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay uh-huh-huh-huh it's okay
It's okay uh-huh-huh-huh it's okay

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi'
In AA with an AK melee finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate retreat like a vacay mayday
This beat is cray-cray Ray J H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the
Monster: You get in my way I'ma feed you to the monster
I'm normal during the day but at night turn into a monster
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla fire spitter monster
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet
Fire Godzilla fire monster
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet


I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see will I still be like this tomorrow
Risperdal voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch "Suck my dick" or "I'll sock you in my pocket"
I'm a cocky prick but you're suck my dick
The balls on this dick oh fickle-ish
Y'all are like a bunch of girls been edgin' a Vicodin
With an A-K to with a stamin' up like Rihanna
With a snake thrown in A-lenn-a Kadir
Ma' a W what's his name Ma' a W-A-K-I-L
I'm a player I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear and even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury herself
And put me on a pedestal yeah
More garbage My music is literal actual


I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake

Fire Godzilla fire monster
Blood on the dance floor and Louis V carpet


If you never gave a damn raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger finger prostate exam exam
How can I have all these fans and perspire
Like a liar's pants I'm on fire fire and I got no plans to retire retire
And I'm still the man you admire revere
These chicks are spazzin' out I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you doin' when you hanal-ing flyers
Brain dead eye drops pain meds cyclops
They bedrock ayy cyclops we-pod know that
Montalk but it's time to walk me

These racks keep me flashin' handsome
She begging me to smash it tragic
Settle down can't do that too erratic

Got my ex tryna ruin
Steel toe you can't walk in my shoes
Ex-drug dealer used to moving pounds
Got my shooters on the roof with a Brown
And they'll shoot at who-ev ever try to bring me down
One thing they know I'm only above the ground
Seven hundred horses now I'm tryna race
Driving fast I think I'm gon' escape
Switchin' lanes nitrous on my engine I'm feelin' like a spaceship
I just wanna smoke weed get deep deep deep
In too deep everytime I wake up I'm somewhere new


Been on my grind won't stop yeah
Don't give a damn you're not my man
I'm ridin' round in a coupe
Used to ride just for the bus
I don't really care 'bout what you do yeah

And I'm on the roads with the bands
I'm thinkin' how the fuck did I make it
I got a bad lil' shorty on my line and she tryna be mine
We both too high and wasted



Yeah yeah
Feelin' deep go and catch a breeze
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Die from a Broken Heart" by Maddie & Tae:


Standing on the front porch staring down the road
Desperately waiting for you to come back home
Twisted up on the floor surrounded by your clothes
I ain't got nowhere to go no no


I'm a little drunk on you and high on summertime
Did my best to make it work but you're still gone and I'm still hurting


I can barely breathe I'm drowning in the deep
Breaking up is never easy I know but I have to go
Know I'm overdue give me all my blues
Honey that's the only way that I'll survive
I gotta learn to love without you die from a broken heart


This sleeping pill ain't working I'm wide awake at 3 AM
Got too much to do without you messing with my mind
And if I don't call then I'm just wasting my time
Wondering if you're out there and if you still think of me


I'm a little drunk on you and high on summertime
Did my best to make it work but you're still gone and I'm still hurting


I can barely breathe I'm drowning in the deep
Breaking up is never easy I know but I have to go
Know I'm overdue give me all my blues
Honey that's the only way that I'll survive
I gotta learn to love without you die from a broken heart


Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I gotta learn to love without you I gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle the tears and the twirls the pain and the pearls
Girl
Did my best to make it work but you still chose to leave
Laughing with my friends holding my head high
Pretending I'm alright


I can barely breathe I'm drowning in the deep
Breaking up is never easy I know but I have to go
Know I'm overdue give me all my blues
Honey that's the only way that I'll survive
I gotta learn to love without you die from a broken heart


Without you without you
Die from a broken heart
Without you without you
Die from a broken heart
Without you without you

Song: Hard to Forget              
Artist: Sam Hunt


The pretty ones like a diamond  
They're always shining always glowing  
Somebody oughta take 'em home  
Some nights I still can hear the Jeep tires squeaking  
I'm barely sleeping in motel parking lots  
It's easy to remember harder to forget


I'm gonna pull my phone out of my pocket  
I'm gonna press record  
And you can tell me every last thing that went wrong  
And I'll point out every rhyme that you blew  
And every reason why we're through  
But you still love me yeahayy  
And you're gonna want me blacked out on the floor  
And you can't help but beg for more  
But darlin' don't you let me don't you let me go


I've had the bourbon let it seep in yeah  
And now there ain't no getting over you  
I'll pour a Medalla and pretend I'm beachside  
And pretend my heartbeat's soundin' like a kick drum  
But all alone just gettin' drunk  
It's easy to remember harder to forget


I'm gonna pull my phone out of my pocket  
I'm gonna press record  
And you can tell me every last thing that went wrong  
And I'll point out every rhyme that you blew  
And every reason why we're through  
But you still love me yeah  
And you're gonna want me blacked out on the floor  
And you can't help but beg for more  
But darlin' don't you let me don't you let me go


I smell your perfume in this pillowcase  
It's all laid out like you planned this place  
I'll never know how you got here  
So damn sure you were over me  
So why'd you have to come tonight  
Baby what's the point of making me cry  
And walk away with somebody else  
Cause darlin' I already tried ayy


I'm gonna pull my phone out of my pocket  
I'm gonna press record  
And you can tell me every last thing that went wrong  
And I'll point out every rhyme that you blew  
And every reason why we're through  
But you still love me yeah  
And you're gonna want me blacked out on the floor  
And you can't help but beg for more  
But darlin' don't you let me no don't you let me  
Darlin' don't you let me don't you let me go
I'll provide the uncensored lyrics of "One Margarita" by Luke Bryan below:

Woo
Haha
Right
 
Couple boys clock out about a half past five
Tryna put a little hammer in their head
Tank tops and flip flops
With a little bit of lime
Cold beer kind of living
Letting all hang out
Sure not much to do but:
 
Chorus:
One margarita two margarita three margarita shot 
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down we'll be on our way 
One more barefoot run
One more last chance to say
 
Hey Seniorita don't you think we need a salt and a Buffet song
A little bit of you little bit of me by the waterside
Order up a boat drink; waitress bring another round
Homemade happiness
A little taste of paradise
 
Chorus:
One margarita two margarita three margarita shot 
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down we'll be on our way 
One more barefoot run
One more last chance to say
 
It's five o'clock somewhere
 
Chorus:
One margarita two margarita three margarita shot 
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down we'll be on our way 
One more barefoot run
One more last chance to say
 
One margarita two margarita three margarita shot 
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down we'll be on our way 
One more barefoot run
One more last chance to say

It's all on me it's my mistake
I said "I don't love you" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye


I just watched you walk away knowing I'll regret this hell I'm living
Everybody tells me that it's time to move on
And I can't even get up I hope you're happy now


Now you're the reason why I can't sleep
And I ain't even had a drink
I'm just thinking how'd I ever let you leave
No lying to myself no reason to pretend
It's a picture in my head of you and him


I just watched you walk away knowing I'll regret this hell I'm living
Everybody tells me that it's time to move on
And I can't even get up I hope you're happy now


Do you feel the way I feel right now
'Cause baby we don't stand a chance no
If you're not going to be running wild with me
Do you feel the way I feel right now


I just watched you walk away knowing I'll regret this hell I'm living
You're the one thing that I want but I can't have
And I can't even get up I hope you're happy now now now
Oh oh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh oh oh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Sometimes I think I'm Living in his song  
But when I look into my daughter's eyes  
I only pray that she Don't have to wait as long as I did  
Yeah I have been to Tennessee and back  
As a fool and as a man  
And I have traveled down some gravel roads  
With a six pack In a hand  
And I have lost bologna sandwiches  
And I have lost more expensive things  
But I have held on to a pretty thing  
And I have held on to some swings  
Yeah everyone wants to have their say  
Just like a stray dog looking for a place to stay  
Cause as soon as you turn them loose  
They're gone like yesterday  
Last night I took bullets off my shoulders  
And put 'em in the sky  
You're a long way from home  
But I fixed up your room just in case you stop by  
Yeah I have been to heaven on the Fourth of July  
And I have seen the F-100 lighting up the black sky  
And I have witnessed grown men cry  
And I know that if good men die  
There'll be a place already waiting for us in the sky  So when I'm gone  
And when I'm gone  
I hope you miss me some  
Cause someday You'll need to know  
The kind of pain You sold  
And it's crossed my mind  
Even though I'm leaving

Off the swing on your front porch  
Just swings and TV Guide

Chorus:
Well I'm a turner I turn around
Find a way back to my heart
And babe I'm a runner I run around
But I always come back to the start
Oh don't you see me
I'm shining like a diamond
In the rough

And I'll become the bird so you can spread your wings
And I can go both high and low

Verse 2:
Yeah when you shake your head â€˜no'
And you tell me that you're done
Well I know that it's not over until you run

I'm a rebel like that

Chorus:
Well I'm a turner I turn around
Find a way back to my heart
And babe I'm a runner I run around

And I'm feeling pretty damn good
And I'm not feeling stuck
I'm headed to the city lights
And then I'm taking flight flight

I can't breathe Chopsquad I can't breathe 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
I can't breathe I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well


Still no luck but oh well Oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Ring-ring phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line I talk to addiction Uh
Speaking of the devil all the drugs I miss them
This can't be real is it fiction
Somethin' feels broke need to fix it
I cry out for help do they listen
I'ma be alone until it's finished


I can't breathe Chopsquad I can't breathe 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
I can't breathe I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well


I can't breathe Yeah
I'm struggling fighting demons yeah Demons
I'm praying for better seasons yeah
I'm tryna put my mind at ease
Sometimes I don't know what's harder to deal with
The pain or the reasons I'm feeling this way
I need a wonder pill oh I'm late
Codeine's in my liver yeah I'll yell at my liver Liver
Kill me with the drugs I'm the one on the hit list
I'm losing my balance I've been dizzy
You take the knife and compress it to my ribbons
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Devil in my ear tellin' me I'm heartless
How could I be so How could I be so Yeah yeah
Cold in my ways heart frozen it's snowin' in my soul


I can't breathe Chopsquad I can't breathe 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
I can't breathe I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well


But my wishes never granted
I'm broke where the cash at Yeah
I gave her everything she took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken is better than no me
Hope death is easy 'cause life is hard it'll leave you scarred
Oh well better get back to the stars
I guess I'm lying to myself it's fine 'cause I'm fine oh well
Oh well ah well ah-ha

I was sittin' there sellin' turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinkin' "This is where the rednecks come from"
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and lookin' for the interstate
Needin' directions and I was the man for the job
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

I was born in the country and that's where I'll stay
Every dollar I make I'll be owed some day
If it's God's will and I'm lucky yeah I might get to stay
When I die I wanna go out like my grandpa did
Peacefully in his sleep
Askin' every friend and neighbor he had
If they wanted to buy a slightly used plow
I was born in the country and that's where I'll stay

I never thought I'd be a Cadillac buyer
I ain't backin' up I ain't backin' down
I ain't afraid of what they'll say about me
I'm a Jesus-freak a Jack of all trades
I ain't got a dime but what I got is mine
I ain't rich but Lord I'm free

I was born in the country and that's where I'll stay
Every dollar I make I'll be owed some day
If it's God's will and I'm lucky yeah I might get to stay
When I die I wanna go out like my grandpa did
Peacefully in his sleep
Askin' every friend and neighbor he had
If they wanted to buy a slightly used plow
I was born in the country and that's where I'll stay

Oh it does to me
Yeah it does to me

I was born in the country and that's where I'll stay
Every dollar I make I'll be owed some day
If it's God's will and I'm lucky yeah I might get to stay
When I die I wanna go out like my grandpa did
Peacefully in his sleep
Askin' every friend and neighbor he had
If they wanted to buy a slightly used plow
I was born in the country and that's where I'll stay

Yeah it does to me
Yeah it does to me

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Lovin' on You" by Luke Combs:

Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn headlights
Blue eyes tan legs yeah that don't get old
Watching you standing there
Singing along
Yeah I'm into that
Chorus:
But girl I'm diggin' on your curves
And I'm diggin' on your lips
And I'm diggin' on your hips
And I'm diggin' on your kiss
We're holding onto midnight
Like it's a leather jacket
You're sneaking out the window
Yeah this feels like a secret
You got me wrapped around your finger
Like a ring around your finger
Yeah that's just the way you do
I'm lovin' on you
I'm all about long  walks
And the rush of a breeze and a little bit of cardio
Yeah I'm into that
And I'm all about buzzing stealing kisses
Watching the world while my baby twirls
Girl you got me turned up loud
Playing air guitar
Yeah I'm into that
Chorus:
But girl I'm diggin' on your curves
And I'm diggin' on your lips
And I'm diggin' on your hips
And I'm diggin' on your kiss
We're holding onto midnight
Like it's a leather jacket
You're sneaking out the window
Yeah this feels like a secret
You got me wrapped around your finger
Like a ring around your finger
Yeah that's just the way you do

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you I hate you I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone all I hear are the words that I needed to say


When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well time can heal but this won't
So before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face


When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well time can heal but this won't
So before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know you know


Before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know you know
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm on my way to the top no escalator
Used to pour in my Aqualite now I'm pourin' four in a liter
I done made so much money that it's non-stop
I get high 'til I'm highest I won't stop
It's just me myself and I
Ride until I die 'cause I got me for life
I don't need no handouts I'ma get it myself
I'm no stranger to the work I put that shit on myself
They gon' feel me when I'm gone
They say Lil Mosey gone but I ain't goin' nowhere you know
One bad bitch and she do what I say so
Two big 40's and a big-ass Draco
Three more millions when you ask how my day goes
Poured up a four now that's blueberry Faygo
One false move and we straight to shooting shit
Two small bands just to take you out real quick
Three more hoes pull up we let 'em gang-bang
Gone off the Xan thirty man that's insane
One false move and we straight to shooting shit
Two small bands just to take you out real quick
Three more hoes pull up we let 'em gang-bang
Gone off the Xan thirty man that's insane
I'm Lil Mosey I'm a rockstar
Check out my chains yeah I'm a rockstar
The kid ain't mine but the throat is
Diamonds on me keep me icy
Full-length Mink coat cost a brick
No stylist but I'm flyer than a bitch
Bitches on my dick tellin' me that I'm the man
I got bands I'm flexin' with my hands
I got bands I'm flexin' with my hands
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Nobody but You" by Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani:


Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't want your love to make me a better man
I just want to be who I am


So while you're out there ****** up
I'll be here waiting patiently
Hoping that you'll come back to me
You you're all I want when you're not here
Ain't nothin' on the radio
Stevie Nicks is singing in my head
And up in your room
Only one of us was lonely


Sweet but psycho a little bit psycho
At night she's screamin' "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Soon she'll be there scratchin' at the window
I see you ******* I see you lurkin'
Girl don't make me wait too long
Girl don't make me wait too long


So while you're out there ****** up
I'll be here waiting patiently
Hoping that you'll come back to me
You you're all I want when you're not here
Ain't nothin' on the radio
Stevie Nicks is singing in my head
And up in your room
Only one of us was lonely


In the dead of night you went dark on me
I flew off the handle that's what you do to me
I'm just tryna talk problems with us
So don't make it worse I'll see you at the club


So while you're out there ****** up
I'll be here waiting patiently
Hoping that you'll come back to me back to me back to me
You you're all I want when you're not here
Ain't nothin' on the radio
Stevie Nicks is singing in my head
And up in your room
Only one of us was lonely
Nobody but you nobody but you nobody but you
Nobody but you nobody but you nobody but you

I gotta get it off my chest My chest

Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I regret
About that night I wrote a message on your car
Late night we took it too far

Verse 1
I don't wanna seem like it's carelessness
Cause 'cause we be going in too deep
Unexpected you seem to forget your
Words and it's hard for me to believe

Chorus

You you You you
You should be sad
You should be you should be

And now it's too late to tell you how I feel
Take each other to the limit to the max breakin' up again like I do
Oh it's your fault Oh it's your fault

Chorus
You you You you
You should be sad
You should be you should be sad yeah

Alright alright

Benee I'm-a come and make it right

Benee I'm-a come and make it right
Alright alright

Verse 1: Kane Brown
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never met your a**
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that

Chorus: Kane Brown & Swae Lee
We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're good
Kissin' me goodnight
Twenty-five missed calls
In the middle of the night yeah
But we both sayin'
We both sayin' "Don't let it go don't let it go"
Come see me 'fore it's over

Verse 2: Khalid
I said it's okay
But you the only one that knows my heart
Yeah I'm not afraid of being vulnerable
God forbid you leave me in the dark
I need someone to hold
Someone to love
Sometimes I still be feeling alone
I'm more concerned with where you are
Someone to touch someone to trust

Chorus: Kane Brown & Swae Lee
We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're good
Kissin' me goodnight
Twenty-five missed calls
In the middle of the night yeah
But we both sayin'
We both sayin' "Don't let it go don't let it go"
Come see me 'fore it's over

Bridge: Swae Lee
Lately lately I don't wanna talk about it
Feel like I'm tryna work it out work it out
Why you gotta run your mouth
Like you know everything I'm all about
Cause the truth will surface eventually
I don't do this usually
But for you I'll make an exception
Begging for affection oh

Chorus: Kane Brown & Swae Lee
We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're good
Kissin' me goodnight
Twenty-five missed calls
In the middle of the night yeah

Come see me 'fore it's over

Outro: Kane Brown & Khalid

Yeah yeah yeah
Wanna argue until we're good
Twenty-five missed calls
In the middle of the night yeah
Wanna argue until we're good
Come see me 'fore it's over
Verse 1:
Another missed call from my momma
I bet she's wondering what the hell is wrong with her son
I tried to tell her that I'm fine nah I'm lying
I'm losing my mind and I'm running out of time
Wishin' I was somewhere somewhere else out of town
Wishin' I was lost in the woods or maybe halfway around the world right now
Once I get gone ain't no comin' back
I'm on a one-way ride in the wrong direction

Chorus:
So sing it like a hymn another highway blues
We keep listenin' to the wind trying to carry the truth
But I've been living in a hurricane trying to find my way back home
The only thing that I can say is at least I'm not alone
Feels like I'm going insane yeah it's just a part of the show
Everyday feels like the same damn I'm homesick but it's alright though

Verse 2:
Late night facetime with my shorty
I know I always say the same shit but somethin's wrong
I can hear it in your voice you ain't gotta say it
I'ma hit you when I find a spot with service
Wishin' you was here wishin' you were ridin' shotgun
When I'm feelin' like I can't go on you hit me with a song
Once you get away it's hard to go back
I'm on a one-way ride in the wrong direction

Chorus:
So sing it like a hymn another highway blues
We keep listenin' to the wind trying to carry the truth
But I've been living in a hurricane trying to find my way back home
The only thing that I can say is at least I'm not alone
Feels like I'm going insane yeah it's just a part of the show
Everyday feels like the same damn I'm homesick but it's alright though

Bridge:
I gotta keep on keepin' on gotta leave it all behind
Knowin' that it won't be long until I get back home
It's alright though it's alright though yeah

Chorus:
So sing it like a hymn another highway blues
We keep listenin' to the wind trying to carry the truth
But I've been living in a hurricane trying to find my way back home
The only thing that I can say is at least I'm not alone
Feels like I'm going insane yeah it's just a part of the show
Everyday feels like the same damn I'm homesick but it's alright though

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal somebody to know somebody to have somebody to hold
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now I need somebody to know somebody to heal somebody to have just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around

For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

They say "Oh my god I see the way you shine
Take your hand my dear and place them both in mine"
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Hey I'm glad you're back with your bitch

Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend "shoot your shot" when you see 'em
It's OK he already in my DMs
Why men great 'til they gotta be great
Don't text me tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair

Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts needed something more exciting

I'd be happy to provide the uncensored lyrics of "One Man Band" by Old Dominion:


Been flying solo for so long
Nobody's singing the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass no guitar no tambourine
And I found you like a melody
You were singing in the same key as me
We had 'em dancing in the streets
I don't wanna be a one-man band


I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rippling river
Count every kiss every beat of your heart


Been flying solo for so long
Nobody's singing the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass no guitar no tambourine
And I found you like a melody
You were singing in the same key as me
We had 'em dancing in the streets
I don't wanna be a one-man band


I wanna be your A-team
I wanna be your end game end game
I wanna be your classic
On vinyl and digital streaming
And when I'm eighty-seven
You'll know what I mean


Been flying solo for so long
Nobody's singing the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass no guitar no tambourine
And I found you like a melody
You were singing in the same key as me
We had 'em dancing in the streets
I don't wanna be a one-man band


In the taverns of my gray cells
The clock ticks and the time bells
Feeling like I'm running out of time
But if you love me everything's alright


Been flying solo for so long
Nobody's singing the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass no guitar no tambourine
And I found you like a melody
You were singing in the same key as me
We had 'em dancing in the streets
I don't wanna be a one-man band


I don't wanna be a one-man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone
Putting miles on a run-down van
Baby we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat you can carry the tune
We'll get tattoos and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby take my hand
I don't wanna be a one-man band
I don't wanna be a one-man band

Less is more
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah


I love like a fool and don't give a damn
I'd do anything just to get you back again
I used up all of my wishes on you
And all that magic we felt just disappeared too soon


And girl I'm laid up here tonight
Thinkin' 'bout those candy eyes
Thinkin' 'bout how you roll with the punches
And still keep on smilin'
Thinkin' 'bout how much I love
The little things about you like the sound of your laugh


And honey from now on
If you're thinkin' 'bout lettin' go
You can forget about it
Oh and hold on with all your might
Now I love this life that I'm livin'
And I wanna see you by my side
Sayin' that's my baby who needs me
More than my hometown


I ain't tryna let my friends know
How lost I'd be without you though
They see right through they know me too
Baby they know 'bout us whoa


But girl you're laid up here tonight
Thinkin' 'bout the times we've had
The way I always run back to you
When somethin' makes me mad
Thinkin' 'bout how good it feels
Just to lay your head down on my chest


And honey from now on
If you're thinkin' 'bout lettin' go
You can forget about it
Oh and hold on with all your might
Now I love this life that I'm livin'
And I wanna see you by my side
Sayin' that's my baby who needs me
More than my hometown


Oh oh oh oh

Yeah when I get to Hank's place yeah it takes me back to that feeling

When I could finally be by myself

Said I wouldn't be no one else

Just look at me

I'm still goin' out like that

And I'm still hangin' around with my boys

Still finding hell raisin' noise

I'm still singing 'Free Bird' with the crowd

And ya know my mama still hates ya

And daddy still laughs about the time

You shot out his truck tire

But I'm still chasin' you

Like that first high

Colorado hit like a freight train

We climbed a mile high to the top of that rock

Never seen anything never felt so alive

Just me and you and the sky

That view's been trippin' me out

So I'll ease up on the loud

But when I hear that song and I'm alone

It hits me right in my feels and that fire dome

I still turn it up yeah

And sing it like we're still around

Untie me from this line baby

No matter how hard I try

I'm still chasin' you

Like that song does

Shot of whiskey down in Mexico

One more sunrise that I'll never know how to let go

You set up shop in the deepest part of my mind

I'm still a little bit drunk off that high

I'm still chasin' you

Like that goodbye hard to find

Oh so baby say you're moved on

Say that you finally found someone

That loves you better than I could

And you see it now what we had was good

Oh but I'm still chasin' you

'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round 'round

'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round 'round

'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round 'round

'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round 'round
