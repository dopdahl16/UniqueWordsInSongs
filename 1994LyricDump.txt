I I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you
Why do I bother when you're not the one for me


Is enough enough
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong


But where do you belong
Under the pale moon for so many years I've wondered who you are
How can a person like you bring me joy
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars


Is enough enough
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong


I saw the sign I saw the sign
I saw the sign I saw the sign
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the sign


No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side 
I see the questions in your eyes 
I know what's weighing on your mind 
You can be sure I know my heart 
`Coz I'll stand beside you through the years 
You'll only cry those happy tears 
And though I make mistakes 
I'll never break your heart 

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there 
I swear like the shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 
For better or worse `till death do us part 
I'll love you with every beat of my heart 
I swear 

I'll give you every thing I can 
I'll build your dreams with these two hands 
We'll hang some memories on the walls 
And when just the two of us are there 
You won't have to ask if I still care 
`Coz as the time turns the page my love won't age at all 

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there 
I swear like the shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 
For better or worse `till death do us part 
I'll love you with every beat of my heart 
I swear 

I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there 
I swear like the shadow that's by your side 
I'll be there 
For better or worse `till death do us part 
I'll love you with every beat of my heart 
I swear 
I swear 
Oh I swear

Baby all through the night  
I'll make love to you  
When you want me to  
And I will not let go  
Till you tell me to
The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
The power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light-years away

'Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
The power of love

The power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
The power of love

There's a hero if you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer if you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away


And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you


It's a long road when you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love if you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt will disappear


And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you


Lord knows dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone tear them away yeah
Hold on there will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way


And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Verse 1:
You say
I only hear what I want to
And you say
I talk so all the time so

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you

Chorus:
Yeah I missed you
And you say "I only hear what I want to"
I don't listen hard
Don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
To anyone anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative: no no no

Verse 2:
So I turned the radio on
I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
Lovers in love and the others run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay

Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
dying since the day they were born
Well this is not that:
I think that I'm throwing but I'm thrown

Chorus:
And I thought I'd live forever but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
but that won't take me anyhow
Or anywhere with you

Bridge:
You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought 'hey I can leave I can leave'
But now I know that I was wrong 'cause I missed you

Chorus:
You said "I caught you 'cause I want you and one day I'll let you go"
You try to give away a keeper or keep me 'cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say "Stay"

You say "Stay"

If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear 'I love you' now and then
Will I never make love to you once again
Please understand if love ends
Then I promise you I promise you that

I shall never breathe again Breathe again
I shall never breathe again

If I never sail through your stormy skies
If I never hear your soothing lullabies
If I never see the truth in your lies
Will I never learn how to love again
Please understand my love's real
I was sittin' here with this pain I feel

I shall never breathe again Breathe again
I shall never breathe again

No one can tell me exactly what to expect
But I know love is worth the risk

I shall never breathe again Breathe again
I shall never breathe again

If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear 'I love you' now and then
Will I never make love to you once again
When it's love you give
I'll be a man of good faith
Then in love you live
I'll make a stand I won't break
I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold

When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
Then there's a reason why
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain

Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

When it's love you make
I'll be the fire in your night
Then it's love you take
I will defend I will fight
I'll be there when you need me
When honor's at stake
This vow I will make:

That it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

Don't lay our love to rest
'Cause we could stand up to the test
We got everything and more than we had planned
More than the rivers that run the land

We got it all in our hands

Now it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
When there's someone that ya want
When there's someone that ya need
Let's make it all all for one and all for love
Verse 1:
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life
When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
Oh what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you
Verse 2:
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
Verse 3:
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
Bridge:
So if you are in sight
And the day is right
She's the hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever
It's a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

If you wanna leave I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go darling maybe it's better that way
I'm gonna be strong; I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine


Just walk out the door and see if I care
Go on and go now but don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking in two
It's gonna happen to me before it happens to you


Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway and that's what made you so mad
I'm gonna be strong; I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine


Just walk out the door and see if I care
Go on and go now but don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking in two
It's gonna happen to me before it happens to you


And it won't be long 'til you're alone
When your lover boy hasn't come home
'Cause I decided to make you cry
When you love someone they just don't treat you right

Just walk out the door and see if I care
Go on and go now but don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking in two
It's gonna happen to me before it happens to you


Don't turn around don't turn around
Don't turn around just walk away
Verse 1: Salt
Uh hey alright ya come on uh huh
I used to want a man to satisfy me
But I'm not the kind of girl who needs a guy
To be sweet to me - the recipe is
Another man - a lover and a friend to me oh lord

Chorus: En Vogue
What a man what a man what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man what a man what a man
What a mighty good man

Verse 2: Salt
What I need is someone who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush of passion hmm
I need someone who'll understand
That it's alright when love's taken slow
Ohh

Chorus: En Vogue
What a man what a man what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man what a man what a man

Verse 4: Salt & Pepa alternating
I wanna take a minute or two and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said / she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect I give props to those who deserve it
And if you're from my hood you can understand that
I'm giving a shout out to the men who never cuss
Strange to the brother's from down under
I give a hollar to my man in the crispy blue Tusc
I never liked a boaster that's why I'm so pleased
To announce that Oaktown's on the sceez

Chorus: En Vogue
What a man what a man what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man what a man what a man
What a mighty good man

Verse 5: En Vogue
What a man what a man what a mighty good man repeat 3x

Bridge: En Vogue

Well sure Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Wild Night" by John Mellencamp with Meshell Ndegeocello:

As you brush your shoes  
And stand before your mirror  
And you comb your hair  
And grab your coat and hat  
And you walk the streets  
Trying to remember  
Yeah wild night is calling  
All right  

The streetlights  
Dazzle you  
The neon  
Feeling just won't let you go  
And the memory  
Of all that you've had  
All that you've known  

Yeah wild night is calling  
All right  
Buckle up now  
Wild night is calling  
All right  

The wistful boys and girls  
Invade your world  
They attack your heart  
and soul yeah

Wild night is calling  
All right  
Wild night is calling  
All right  

All right  

So come on out  
And dance  
Come on honey  
And dance oh yeah  

Because the memory  
Of all that  
That you've had  
It just won't let you be  
No no  

Wild night is calling  
All right  
Wild night is calling  
All right  
All right

I hope that helps
Verse 1:
No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

Chorus:
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrows
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

Verse 2:
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give I can't give anymore

Chorus:
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrows
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

Outro:
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give I can't give anymore
Verse 1:
If you could give me one good reason
Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell
I would sure like to believe you
My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere

Chorus:
You know that I love you
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
I don't wanna live without you

Verse 2:
Ooh you've got a way about you
And I've got a way about me
And if you show me your love
I will show you mine

You know that I love you
You know that I want you

I don't wanna live without you

And if ever I ever fall asleep
I'll never sleep without you
Cause you mean the world to me

Chorus:
You know that I love you
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
I don't wanna live without you
There's a calm surrender
To the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
You're the most beautiful girl in the world
It's plain to see
If the world is seven seas
Then let me sail with thee

You're the eighth wonder of the world
I could even dream
Just give me your hand
And I'll let you lead

You're the most beautiful girl in the world
And that's a fact
Without you there's no reason
For my world to turn

You're the apple in my eye
The sugar in my tea
The two scoops in my sundae
Without you there's no me

You're the most beautiful girl in the world
Without you there's no joy
All the laughter and smile
Pales in comparison to your charming voice

You're the most beautiful girl in the world
Simply the best
Better than all the rest
I'll take you in my arms
And in your love I'll rest
Verse 1:
Come on y’all let’s take a ride
Don’t you say shit just get inside
It’s time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cause you can’t have the hop if you don’t have the hip
Grab your gat with the extra clip and
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We’re goin to a place where everybody kick it
Kick it kick it yeah… that’s the ticket
Ain’t no bloodin’ ain’t no cripin’
Ain’t no punk-ass nigga’s set trippin’
Everybody’s got a stack and it ain’t no crack
And it really don’t matter if you’re white or black I
Wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya
If you can’t take the heat get yo’ ass out the kitchen
We’re on a mission

Chorus:
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
With switches on the block in a ‘65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
Ain’t no valley low enough for mountain high
I’m tryin’ to find a place where I can live my life
And maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside
Without livin’ in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive-by killers
I still got to worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searching and I keep on lookin’
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin’ like they evil
You don’t understand about runnin’ with a gang
Cause you don’t gangbang and
You don’t have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can’t help me if you can’t help yourself
You better make a left

Chorus:
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage

Verse 2:
I’m the captain of this vessel
We wanna take you to another place
A place where your body can be free
And your mind can operate at uh
At uh at a much higher level
It’s not necessary for you to stress
But you can’t get it let me tell you why
We’re so buck why Why Why
Why do we have to die
You’re only 17 you ain’t even lived life
But you’re gonna’ end up a D-B G or BG
Or a key light a wannabe night
But it seems like all the time
Our only new jack’s gettin’ amped just like a vine
They gettin’ stuck and then they jive
That suicide drive
We over and out we’re gone peace

Chorus:
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Ooh baby I love your way everyday
Ooh wanna tell you I love your way everyday
Ooh wanna be with you night and day

Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some firefly
Wonder how they have the power to shine shine shine
I can see them under the pine

But don't hesitate 'cause your love just won't wait
Ooh baby I love your way everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way everyday
Wanna be with you night and day hey

Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some firefly
I wonder how they have the power to shine shine shine
I can see them under the pine

But don't hesitate 'cause your love just won't wait
Ooh baby I love your way
Ooh baby I love your way everyday
Ooh wanna tell you I love your way hey

Ooh wanna be with you night and day

Ooh wanna tell you I love your way hey
Ooh wanna be with you night and dayBigInteger

It was a clear black night a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride chillin' all alone
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr Warren G
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

 
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said "let's do this"
I jumped out the ride and said "what's up"
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said "I'm stuck"
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all-in-a-mix

 
I'm gettin' jacked I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothas and said "damn what's next"
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down

 
They got muscle and said "we're real hard to hit"
But I said "ya'll some fools watch me make ya'll split"
They kept on comin' and then they went too far
When Warren G gets involved ya'll know the deal is bizarre
I hooked up with the playa that's going to get me paid
I got him at the store and picked up is the scoop
235 on a 12-gauge shotgun
Gotta short got to get what's mine
Repeat until fade
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "If You Go" by Jon Secada:

If you go you take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no baby please don't go
And if you leave then everything I do is out of tune
My baby no no please don't go
And if you go I'll have a hole in my soul
I'll feel the world would lose its control
And if you go who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up oh yeah
When I'm down
No one else can make it right
Only you oh treat me like you do
And if you go you'll take away the very heart of me
My baby please don't go
And if you go the world could know nothing about living
It's so true no no please don't go
And if you go I'll have a hole in my soul
I'll feel the world would lose its control
And if you go who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up oh yeah
When I'm down
No one else can make it right
Only you oh treat me like you do
And if you go you take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no baby please don't go
And if you leave then everything I do is out of tune
My baby no no please don't go
When I'm down
No one else can make it right
Only you oh treat me like you do
And if you go you take away the very heart of me
My baby please don't go
Please don't go
Don't go away
Please believe me when I say
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Back & Forth" by Aaliyah:

Let me see you go back
Let me see you come forth
It's Friday
And I'm ready to swing pick up my girls
And hit the party scene
Tonight oh it's alright
So get up and let this funky mellow groove
Get you in the mood
'Cause you know
It's alright alright

It's alright alright
back and forth
And it's alright oh yeah
Now honey don't you take your love
Away from me
And if you leave my heart
In misery
Then you'll understand the
Error of your ways
But we can work it out
And everything will be okay alright
back and forth
We can work it out alright

And everything will be okay
Let me see you go back let me see you come forth
Let me see you go back let me see you come forth

Whenever I'm weary from the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever I will be your man

Sometimes I just hold you too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune that heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever I will be your man
Now and forever I will be your man
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "When Can I See You" by Babyface:

When can my heart beat again
When does the pain ever end

When can my heart beat again

Hey yo here we go here we go
Now listen I'ma break it down and start from scratch
I'm frying chicken up in here

Verse 1:
Yo VIP let's kick it
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop Yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Chorus:
Dance go on and dance
Come on and dance
A come on and dance

Verse 2:
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point to the point no faking
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning 'em if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped-up tempo
I'm on a roll it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 50
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
Did you stop No I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue

Chorus:
Dance go on and dance
Come on and dance
A come on and dance

Verse 3:
Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast other DJs say "damn"
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

Chorus:
Dance go on and dance
Come on and dance
A come on and dance

Outro:
Yo man let's get out of here Word to your mother
Oh Heaven let your light shine down

I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine
Heaven let your light shine down
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine

Heaven let your light shine down
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine
Heaven let your light shine down
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine

Heaven let your light shine down
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine
Heaven let your light shine down
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine

Heaven let your light shine down
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine
Heaven let your light shine down
I'm gonna let it shine
I'm gonna let it shine

Heaven let your light shine down
You are my guiding light
A shining star
You take my hand
And show me the way

I care about you
More than words can say
I need you near me
Every single day

Said I loved you
But I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you
But I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong

Said I loved you
But I lied

With all my soul
I've tried in vain
How can mere words
My heart explain

This taste of heaven
So deep so true
I've found in you
So many things

'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you
But I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong

Said I loved you
But I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you
But I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong

Said I loved you
But I lied

Said I loved you
But this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you
But I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong

Said I loved you
But I lied

End of lyrics
Hit it

This ain't no disco
And it ain't no country club either
This is LA

"All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die" says the
man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me
'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels
From his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match
In an oversized pack
Letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds
And the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon
But all all I wanna do wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do wanna do
Is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over
Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over
Santa Monica Boulevard
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" by Crash Test Dummies:

Once there was this kid who  
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school  
But when he finally came back  
His hair had turned from black into bright white he said  
'Cause it was all that they had left him  
And that's called er gets rid of stains

And when he finally came back  
His hair had turned from black into bright white he said  
'Cause it was all that they had left him  
And that's called er gets rid of stains

Momma she was a queen of the road  
But we'd steal car wheels and cross country  
And that's how we'd get our meals  
We'd go to a restaurant then  
Bite our backs and then we'd beat our tails  
But waitress would come and bring our meal  

And when he finally came back  
His hair had turned from black into bright white he said  
'Cause it was all that they had left him  
And that's called er gets rid of stains  

Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm  
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Funkdafied" by Da Brat:

Verse 1:
I put it down 
for the L-town
I'm the round mound 
with the dope sound
Yes I'm the B-R-A-T
with the funkified style that you hear me
And when I step up in the place
Ain't nothin' but sweat inside my hands
That's when I got to grab the mic 
and make it understood
I'm from the bad bad L-town 
And ain't nothing good

Chorus:
Ain't nobody dope as me
I'm dressed so fresh so clean
So fresh and so clean clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy
I'm just so fresh so clean
So fresh and so clean clean

Verse 2:
I love the way you stare 
At me when I'm working on my thang
I wanna take you to my attic 
And show you all my bling
I'm looking for a real big twinkle 
To make my earrings sparkle
Genuine funky for ya 
And my trunk is gonna rattle

Chorus:
Ain't nobody dope as me
I'm dressed so fresh so clean
So fresh and so clean clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy
I'm just so fresh so clean

Bridge:
We flip the strip back 
As we dip in our Cadillac
We got these haters looking 
Mad because they want our style
All up in our business 
Like a kitty in a litter box
You know we're the baddest chicks 
So it's time for our victory lap

Chorus:
Ain't nobody dope as me
I'm dressed so fresh so clean
So fresh and so clean clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy

Outro:
Funkdafied and we're hittin' the spot
All headed to the beauty shop
We've got our nails and hair done
All steppin' out in our sexy thongs
Gettin' our party on
From dusk until dawn
I'll take you around the way 
And let you hang with Da Brat

And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
oh no no way
And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love but I won't do that no no no I won't do that


Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again


Maybe I'm crazy but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me no one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true you better believe it
That I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love but I won't do that
No no no I won't do that


Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the gods of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling
Some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls


And maybe I'm lonely that's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only one and only promise I can keep


As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true you better believe it
That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there until the final act
I would do anything for love
And I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love but I won't do that
No I won't do that

Verse 1:
You're staring me down
A glance a touch
I'm weak
It's true
I've fallen for you
But it's alright
Because of love

Chorus:
I'll walk the line for you
Because of love
I'll lose my mind over you
Because of love
I'll stand before a jury
And gladly testify
Because of love
I'd lie for you
Cross my heart and hope to die
Because of love

Verse 2:
You somehow change me
Inside out
I can't explain
But there's no doubt
I'll go through hell
And face the flames
Because of love

Chorus:
I'll walk the line for you
Because of love
I'll lose my mind over you
Because of love
I'll stand before a jury
And gladly testify

Cross my heart and hope to die
Because of love

Bridge:
Through thick and thin
I'll be your friend
Until the end
Because of love

Chorus:
I'll walk the line for you
Because of love
I'll lose my mind over you
Because of love
I'll stand before a jury
And gladly testify
Because of love
I'd lie for you
Cross my heart and hope to die
Because of love
If you if you could return
Don't let it burn don't let it fade
I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining every day
For me I swore I swore
I would be true
And honey so did you
So why were you holding her hand
Is that the way we stand
Were you lying all the time
Was it just a game to you
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger
Oh I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong I was wrong
If you if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just wanna be with you
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger
And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger
In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches sleep on the love seat
Someone keeps sayin' I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park
Yo cut it
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
Double-barrel buckshot
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of a folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
That's chokin' on the splinters
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
Get crazy with the Cheez Wiz
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
Drive-by body-pierce
Yo bring it on down
Soooooooyy
I'm a driver I'm a winner; things are gonna change I can feel it
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
I can't believe you
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
Sprechen Sie Deutche baby
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me
All alone on the edge of sleep  
My old familiar friend  
Comes and lies down next to me  
And I can see your face  
Light up the place  
As I fall back to sleep  
I have never felt so complete yet so incomplete  

And I try to find the words  
But none of them will do  
To describe my fear of losing you  

I found out about you  
I found out about you  
Out on a wind-swept evening  
Blowing through the corridors in absolute silence  
I found out about you  

Broken by the rain  
Broken by the world  
I know there's something that will heal me  

And I try to find the words  
But none of them will do  
To describe my fear of losing you  

I found out about you  
I found out about you  
Out on a wind-swept evening  
Blowing through the corridors in absolute silence  
I found out about you  

All this eyes  
Can't be the same  
And all these years  
Seem to have gone in vain  

And I try to find the words  
But none of them will do  
To describe my fear of losing you  

I found out about you  
I found out about you  
Out on a wind-swept evening  
Blowing through the corridors in absolute silence  
I found out about you  

I found out about you  
I found out about you  
Out on a wind-swept evening  
Blowing through the corridors in absolute silence  
I found out about you  

I found out about you  
I found out about you
Verse 1:
With so much drama in the L-B-C

So turn off the lights and close the door
But but what we don't love them hoes yeah
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this yeah
G's up hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Chorus:
Rollin' down the street smokin' indo sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Verse 2:
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G
I got the cultivatin' music that be captivatin' he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie Sadie
She used to be the homeboy's lady Oh that bitch
Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's 'cause you gets none of these
At ease as I mob with the Dogg Pound feel the breeze

Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Chorus:
Rollin' down the street smokin' indo sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Outro:
Later on that day
My homie Dr Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke shit this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin' I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut I'm raisin' to the top
The Dogg Pound's got me workin' overtime
And I'm eight five five seven nine three eleven
From OGLLC what
Willie D and who
It's like that and as a matter of fact rat-tat-tat-tat
Cuz I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back yeah
Y'all remember that shit Yeah
From the D-O-double-G Snoop Dogg

Fool I'm the king of the gangsta groove
Gettin' funky with it

Yeah yeah yeah
Uh-huh


Never lie no no no no
Never lie no no no no
Never lie no no no no
Never lie to me baby


I heard you talking to your sister on the phone
Said you couldn't wait for me to leave you alone
Now why you wanna go and do me like that
After all that we've been through everything we had


I can't believe you'd do me like this
Every time I think about it girl I can't resist
The pain that I feel in my heart
I never thought that you would go and tear my world apart


Never lie no no no no
Never lie no no no no
Never lie no no no no
Never lie to me baby


I can't ignore the tears that are streaming down my face
I've been trying for so long just to find my place
But every time I try to leave your side
I find that I just can't understand why you lied


I can't believe you'd do me like this
Every time I think about it girl I can't resist
The pain that I feel in my heart
I never thought that you would go and tear my world apart


Never lie no no no no
Never lie no no no no
Never lie no no no no
Never lie to me baby


Don't you ever lie
Don't you ever lie
No no no no no no
Don't you ever lie to me girl
I was bruised and battered I couldn't tell what I felt I was unrecognizable to myself I saw my reflection in a window I didn't know my own face Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away On the streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone At night I could hear the blood in my veins Black and whispering as the rain On the streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me It's just you and I my friend And my clothes don't fit me no more I walked a thousand miles Just to slip this skin The night has fallen I'm lyin' awake I can feel myself fading away So receive me brother with your faithless kiss Or will we leave each other alone like this On the streets of Philadelphia
Verse One:
Bustin’ on fools known for it
Bellin’ through the hood yellin’ "I’m schemin’ on gettin' more grip"
Than any brother seen or dreamin’ about
I’m just a microphone fiend out on the route
To put my groove on wax and tax
Brothers that try to flow but they just collapse
To the side as I glide and ride
On any funky track that be soundin' tight
I’m makin’ papers and breakin’ fools
In the town where I’m from known for breakin’ rules
And shakin’ fools that wanna come in my path
Tryin' to hold me back with my foot in their ass
So step back and give a brother some room
The Domino is back and I’m bringin' it soon
With the Getto Jam so clap your hands
And hold onto your girl cause I guarantee she’ll scram
For me and my homies that’s how the story goes
In Compton the city that we call home

Chorus:
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh

Verse Two:
I’m ridin’ through the hood pumpin’ the sound
That’s makin’ all the homies wanna gather around
To hear the rhymes that flow with the beat
And if it’s not Domino it’s incomplete
So listen up close to the rhymin' rhyme
As we roll to the give and give to the blind
And praise the lord for all of the help
And let the chumps come and feel how we felt
Passin’ us by tryin’ to hold us down
While we up on the stage throwin’ down mad sounds
Comin’ direct from the Getto that’s how we movin'
And if you didn’t know the Domino’s groovin'
So clap your hands to the beat and feel
The groove that we’re groovin' we keepin' it real
The Getto Jam is a way of life
We hustle everyday just to get the price

Chorus:
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh

Verse Three:
When I'm rollin' I'm controllin'
The bass treble echo all that mouldin'
To make a funky beat like this
Takes a lot of patience and time and twist
But I always seem to find the right groove
That’ll make you move or shake or prove
That you can dance to the groove I make
So tell me how many people wanna break
Off a little somethin' with the Domino
And tell all your friends that you heard it from the O
The Comptown Mack with the funky rap
And just like the King said "I’ll be back"
So don’t try to step or break the rules
Cause we comin' with the Getto Jam for the fools

Chorus:
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
Getto Jam oh oh oh oh
  
My love  
There's only you in my life  
The only thing that's bright  
My first love  
You're every breath that I take  
You're every step I make

  
And I I want to share  
All my love with you  
No one else will do  
And your eyes your eyes your eyes  
They tell me how much you care  
Oh yes you will always be  
My endless love

  
Two hearts  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Our lives have just begun  
Forever oh  
I'll hold you close in my arms  
I can't resist your charms

  
And I I'll be a fool  
For you I'm sure  
You know I don't mind  
Oh you know I don't mind  
And yes you'll be the only one  
'Cause no one can deny  
This love I have inside  
And I'll give it all to you  
My love my love my love

  
My endless love  
  
I'll be that fool  
For you I'm sure  
  
You know I don't mind  
  
Oh you know I don't mind  
And yes you'll be the only one  
'Cause no one can deny  
This love I have inside  
And I'll give it all to you  
My love my love my love  
  
My endless love
I miss you I'm talking to you baby
I miss you yeah
Listen
Verse 1:
I'm still caught up with the thought of you
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
All alone in my room I can't help but think of you
You're not here and it ain't right
What's goin' on how could this be so wrong
I can't stand another night alone
Without you ooh without you
Baby baby I miss you

Chorus:
I miss you I'm talking to you baby
I miss you ooh
I hope you miss me too
I miss you I miss you I'm talking to you baby I'm talking to you
I miss you I miss you ooh
I hope you miss me too ooh baby

Verse 2:
There's no way that I can shake this feeling
I'm in too deep I can't let go
It's not a game it's real my heart's still beating
Just for you don't you know
What's goin' on how could this be so wrong
I can't stand another night alone
Without you ooh without you
Baby baby I miss you

Chorus:
I miss you I'm talking to you baby
I miss you ooh
I hope you miss me too
I miss you I miss you I'm talking to you baby I'm talking to you

Chorus:

Verse One
It's kinda easy when you're listening to the G'd-up sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo' yo' ass and it's easy to see
That this DJ be Warren G

I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it goin' on baby in the Palisades
You can hear my whistle blowin' as I'm comin' around the mountain
Thankin' all the fans and I'm countin'

Honeys break out your red dress
I'mma take you out tonight on a train to Paris
Going to a party at the embassy
And wouldn't you know It's starring me

Chorus
I'm the G in the place to be
Warren G is in the house and he's here to stay
I'm the DJ at the Club n-a-n-a
The crowd is live and the breaking in the front door
Verse Two
I'm creeping with the freaks and I'm peeping out the window
And Brenda's got a baby but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame the girl can hardly spell her name
That's not our problem that's up to Brenda's family
Well let me hit the freeway and I'm gone
Bella ain't no need to explain further
I'm a Long Beach n---- with a rap sheet
As long as my muthaf----ing rap sheet

I'm chillin' real laid back
'Stead of just being jealous you can't hack
Come back like a prodigal son
Let me hit you with some of this "Get-Biz-Done"

Chorus
I'm the G in the place to be
Warren G is in the house and he's here to stay
I'm the DJ at the Club n-a-n-a
The crowd is live and the breaking in the front door
Verse Three
It's a quarter to twelve and we're just getting in
About to hit the club for the night yo' man
In the queue ain't no doubt in my mind
That we're the freshest crew so step aside

I'm 'way too cool for school that's why I'm on the radio
And I'm cruisin' I'm just cruisin'
Cruisin' down the street that I love
And everything is fine all of the time

Chorus
I'm the G in the place to be
Warren G is in the house and he's here to stay
I'm the DJ at the Club n-a-n-a
The crowd is live and the breaking in the front door
I'm the G in the place to be
Warren G is in the house and he's here to stay
I'm the DJ at the Club n-a-n-a
The crowd is live and the breaking in the front door
All alone tonight
I'm calling out your name somewhere deep inside
This endless silent cry
Can't you hear my lonely soul Oh no

It's like a river of tears
That's running through my veins
I'm feeling all this pain
I'm going insane
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please
Baby won't you hear my cry
Cry for you

Chorus
I can't imagine life without you
So tell me what am I supposed to do

Verse 2
Can't you see that I'm going out of my mind
I'll give you all my love
My heart my time
I'm begging you
Please don't let me go
I'm reaching out for you
Baby don't you know

It's like a river of tears
That's running through my veins
I'm feeling all this pain
I'm going insane
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please
Baby won't you hear my cry
Cry for you

Chorus
I can't imagine life without you
So tell me what am I supposed to do

Bridge
I can't go on without your love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
I can't imagine life without you
So tell me what am I supposed to do

It's like a river of tears
That's running through my veins
I'm feeling all this pain
I'm going insane
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please
Baby won't you hear my cry
Cry for you

Chorus
I can't imagine life without you
So tell me what am I supposed to do
Verse One:
Little somethin' for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares and don't nobody else care
And uhh I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry dry your eyes never let up
Forgive but don't forget girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy
When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women do we hate our women
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies but keep your head up

Chorus:
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things'll get brighter

Verse Two:
Aiyyo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for tha pen
I try and find my friends but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for tha future and then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up you got to keep your head up

Chorus:
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things'll get brighter

Verse Three:
And uhh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
Cause I think we can make it in fact I'm sure
And if you fall stand tall and come back for more
Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son wants to know why
Daddy don't love him no more
And ain't nothin' worse than when your daughter
Wants to grow up to be a woman
And she's told that she's fat and she's ugly
The opposite of a Thairoughbred
Mississippi dipped in chocolate
The girls are brought up to be thinkers
And taught that they're smarter
Boys are brought up to be soldiers
And taught to be harder
We're `posed to be perfect
And when we f--k up we're reminded
The only way to deal with it is brush it off and keep grindin'
Climbin' to the top wherever that may be
Just keep your eyes on the prize and one day you'll see

Chorus:
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things'll get brighter

Outro:
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things'll get brighter fade out

Eazy-E: Yo man Aye you remember that shit we did back in '94
Snoop Dogg: Hell yeah Let me hear some of that Doggy Dogg shit
Eazy-E: And it goes like this and it goes like that and it goes like this and uh


It's the capital S oh yes the fresh N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G-Y D-O-double-G ya see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
So Dre What up dog
We gotta give 'em what they want What's that G
We gotta break 'em off somethin' Hell yeah
And it's gotta be bumpin' City of Compton

It's where it takes place so I'm a ask your attention
Mobbin' like a mothafucka but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucka niggas mumble
When I move the mic is like a cookie they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My mothafuckin' homie Snoop Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'm a continue to put the rap down put the mack down
And if your bitches talk shit I have ta put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together like my nigga DOC
No one can do it better like this two-man crew
They say we want revolution
I say that's a stupid-ass question
'Cause who's got the feelin' the skill to kill
And the women love us for the way we chill
The big Snoop Dogg and Doctor Dre making
Funky records for the street to blaze and
And when I'm on the microphone you gotta listen
To some of the real somethin' that I'm spittin'
And get a grip while I get on this funky ass track
Like that it's like that

It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
 It's like that and like this and like that and uh
 It's like this and like that and like this and uh



 It's like this
And who gives a fuck about those
So just chill 'til the next episode
I'm still hangin' on the same spot
Hopin' that the shit'll change but it's not
Gangsta's boogie makin' shoogy makin' funky music
To add to my collection the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke but don't choke
If ya do ya have no clue
O' what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
 It's like this and who gives a fuck about those
So just chill 'til the next episode
Falling back on that ass with a hellified gangsta's lean
Gettin funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S oh yes the fresh N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G Y D-O-double-G ya see
Showing much flex when its time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfucking G shit
So hats up get a grip and come equipped
Cause its like shit that's dope music
 So just chill 'til the next episode


Fallin' back on that ass

Yo' I got the feelin'
It's the capital S O Soprano fresh N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G ya' see
Afro Puffs and the stuff
Sure Here are the unedited lyrics of "Another Night" by Real McCoy:

Another night another dream but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

Just another night another vision of love
You feel joy you feel pain 'cause nothing will be the same
Just another night is all that it takes
To understand the difference between lovers and fakes so baby

I talk talk I talk to you
In the night in your dream of love so true
I talk talk I talk to you
In the night in your dream of love so true

In the night in my dreams I'm in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy I feel pain 'cause it's still the same
When the night is gone I'll be alone

Another night another dream but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

I talk talk I talk to you
Whisper my dreams my thoughts so all you can feel
I talk talk I talk to you
In the night in your dream of love so true

I talk talk I talk to you
In the night in your dream of love so true

Another night another dream but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

Another night another dream but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

I talk talk I talk to you
In the night in your dream of love so true
I talk talk I talk to you
Whisper my dreams my thoughts so all you can feel

On a hot summer night would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses
Will he offer me his mouth
Yes
Will he offer me his teeth
Yes
Will he offer me his jaws
Yes
Will he offer me his hunger
Yes
Again will he offer me his hunger
Yes
And will he starve without me
Yes
And does he love me
Yes
Yes
On a hot summer night would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses
Yes
I bet you say that to all the boys
It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning
There was fog crawling over the sand
When I listened to your heart I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars falling through your trembling hands
You were licking your lips and your lipstick shining
I was dying just to ask for a taste
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the light of the moon the moon the moon
The way you look I know it's true
You're gonna make my dreams come true
And I compliment you on your eyes and your shoes
And your tastes in music
And how you've got everything if you have got me
You know you know you know
It was easy to see it all
The way you look I know that
You're gonna make my dreams come true
You're gonna make my dreams come true
You're gonna make my dreams come true
You're gonna make my dreams come true
Sometimes it's hard
To describe how I feel
This feeling's unreal
I knew it from the start

I see your face
And it just ain't enough
Without you near I can't get enough
Enough of this stuff

I'm in love it's always been you
I'm in love it's always been you

In my arms I want you to stay
Holdin' you tight night after night

I'm in love oh yeah
It's always been you

I feel for you
There's nothing to hide
It's better than burnin' inside
I'll take it all in my stride

I'm in love it's always been you
I'm in love it's always been you

In my arms I want you to stay
Holdin' you tight night after night

I'm in love oh yeah
It's always been you

I'm in love it's always been you
In my arms I want you to stay
Holdin' you tight night after night

I'm in love oh yeah

Waitin' on you

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Dreams" by Gabrielle:

Verse 1:
Now here you go again you say you want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad in the stillness of remembering
What you had and what you lost
And what you had and what you lost

Chorus:
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know you'll know

Verse 2:
Now here I go again I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell
Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had oh what you lost

Chorus:
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know you'll know

Chorus:
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know

Chorus:
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
Call him Mr Raider
Call him Mr Wrong
Call him Mr Vain
Call him Mr Raider
Call him Mr Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr Vain

Call me Raider call me Wrong
Call me insane
Call me Mr Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me time and again

Feel the presence of the aura
Of the man none to compare
Loveless dying for a chance just to touch
A hand or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge that makes them
Want to lose themselves to the debonair one

Hold me back the simple fact is
That I'm all that and I'm always near

Call him Mr Raider
Call him Mr Wrong
Call him Mr Vain
Call him Mr Raider
Call him Mr Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr Vain

He'd say I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr Vain
She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on an Indiana night

Well she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said "I dig you baby but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on"

Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Tired of this town again

Well I don't know but I've been told
You never slow down you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up I'm tired of bein' down
I'm tired of myself I'm tired of this town
Oh my my oh hell yes
Honey put on that party dress
Buy me a drink sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Tired of this town again

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
Nightfall will be comin' soon
Oh my my oh hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Tired of this town again
You're my peace of mind
In this crazy world
You're everything I've tried to find
Your love is a pearl

You're my Mona Lisa
You're my rainbow skies
And my only prayer is that you realize
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

The world will turn
And the seasons will change
And all the lessons we will learn
Will be beautiful and strange

We'll have our fill of tears
Our share of sighs
And my only prayer is that you realize
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

You will always be beautiful in my eyes
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
More beautiful in my eyes

When the sun goes down
And the moonlight fades away
You'll always be my star
In the night sky

And if I can't find my way
If the road ahead's not clear
When I am lost
And I can't see the light

You'll be my beacon
Shining bright
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
More beautiful in my eyes
The passing years will show
That you will always grow
More beautiful in my eyes

Yeah yeah yeah you got that good stuff go ahead and give it up
Huh ah I'll just stay ah here just-a-just-a freakin'

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Prayer for the Dying" by Seal:

Fearless people careless needle
Harsh words spoken and lives are broken
Forceful aging help me I'm fading
Heaven's waiting it's time to move on

Crossing that bridge with lessons I've learned
Playing with fire and not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on it goes on

Just say die and that would be pessimistic
In your mind we can walk across water
Please don't cry it's just a prayer for the dying
I just don't know what's got into me
Been crossin' that bridge with lessons I've learned
Playing with fire and not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
There is a light through that window I see
That light is hope hope that scares the darkness in me
Am I tough enough
Am I rough enough
Am I rich enough
I'm not too blind to see
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on it goes on
What you gonna do
Do
Do
Verse 1:
Things haven’t been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I’m never ever ever gonna let it go

Verse 2:
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Chorus:
Something’s comin’ over mmm
Something’s comin’ over ooh
Something’s comin’ over
I’m just tryin’ to be myself
All I wanna do is be with you

Verse 3:
Time flies when you’re havin’ fun
I heard somebody say
But if all I’ve been is fun then baby
Let me go don’t wanna be in your way

Bridge:
And I don’t wanna be your prisoner
So baby won’t you set me free
Stop playin’ with my heart
Finish what you start

Chorus:
Something’s comin’ over mmm
Something’s comin’ over ooh
Something’s comin’ over
I’m just tryin’ to be myself
All I wanna do is be with you

Outro:
It’s time to give me up
I’ll be gone oh oh oh
It’s time to give me up
I’ll be gone oh oh oh
It’s time to give me up
I’ll be gone oh oh oh
It’s time to give me up
I’ll be gone oh oh oh

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Everyday" by Phil Collins:

Everyday hey hey
When I'm with you girl I get an extension
And I'm in trouble girl but I don't care
When I'm with you girl I get the intention
To be a millionaire

I want to work night and day
Till I can buy you everything
Everyday yeah everyday
I want to hold you tight
And never let you go
Everyday yeah everyday

And maybe if I'm good I'll get to heaven
Or maybe if I'm bad I'll go to hell
When I'm with you girl I feel like I'm in heaven
I'm under your spell

I want to work night and day
Till I can buy you everything
Everyday yeah everyday
I want to hold you tight
And never let you go
Everyday yeah everyday

Ooh I can't wait till we're together
Ooh I can't wait till we're together
Ooh I can't wait till we're together

Everyday I want to work night and day
Till I can buy you everything
Everyday yeah everyday
I want to hold you tight
And never let you go
Everyday yeah everyday

Everyday hey hey
Gimme the gun
He leans so far into the bar
That his cowboy hat
Falls from his head into his lap
Been this way since that girl walked in here
And he wonders if she notices him at all
He's paralyzed by the angel-like way she moves
Saves up his courage and approaches her taking her by the elbow
He says "Hey baby can I buy you a drink"
She says "I don't drink"
And he thinks "God what a beautiful girl
And she won't even have a drink with me"
Oh please don't take her
She's the only thing I've got goin'
You can take my money my cigarettes
But she's the only thing I've got and it hurts me so
Please don't take her don't take her away from me
He stands watching her leave
Her tall silhouette
He hates that place but he loves that girl
He can tell that something's wrong
Standing on the edge of the balcony
Looking down into the street below
Thinking "What if I jumped
What if I took my life at this moment"
He knows he could never do it
He'd never have the courage to follow through
Oh please don't take her
She's the only thing I've got goin'
You can take my money my cigarettes
But she's the only thing I've got and it hurts me so
Please don't take her don't take her away from me
She's everything that I am
Everything I'll ever need
She's the reason I get up in the mornin'
She's the reason I lay in bed and sleep
But now she's gone
Leaving just memories that I can't escape
No matter how hard I try
Oh please don't take her
She's the only thing I've got goin'
You can take my money my cigarettes
But she's the only thing I've got and it hurts me so
Please don't take her don't take her away from me
Please don't take her

Uh huh you got me waiting
Uh huh you got me waiting
Uh huh you got me waiting


You say you're on your way
But I don't see you
And you claim you'll be here
Did I hear you say 2
I've been waiting anticipating
You said you'd come but I'm still waiting


Got me waiting yeah yeah
Got me waiting oh yeah
Got me waiting yeah yeah
Got me waiting


I'm not trying to be rude
But it's hard to get in the mood
When you're not here
And I'm all alone with this attitude
Don't you know that I need you here beside me
Don't you know that it's killing me Please


Got me waiting yeah yeah
Got me waiting oh yeah
Got me waiting yeah yeah
Got me waiting


Don't you know I need your love
Don't you know I need your touch
Don't you know I need you here with me
Don't you keep me waiting


Got me waiting yeah yeah
Got me waiting oh yeah
Got me waiting yeah yeah
Got me waiting


Uh huh you got me waiting
You got me waiting
Uh huh you got me waiting
You got me waiting
Oh what a night late December back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember what a night

Oh what a night you know I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady what a night

Oh I I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I as I recall it ended much too soon

Oh what a night hypnotizing mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender what a night

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under

Oh what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light
Seemed so wrong but now it seems so right
What a lady what a night

Oh I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under

Oh what a night oh what a night oh what a night
Oh what a night oh what a night oh what a night
Oh what a night oh what a night oh what a night
Oh what a night oh what a night oh what a night
This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up

It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up

Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby that's just me

Yeah I will love you baby
Always and I'll be there forever and a day
Always

I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye

What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes I'm just a man

When he holds you close when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time

Yeah I will love you baby
Always and I'll be there forever and a day
Always

I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you always

Always

I will love you baby always
And I'll be there forever and a day always

Please find the uncensored lyrics below:

Please baby can't you see
My mind's a burnin' hell
I got razors a rippin' and tearin' and strippin'
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for something new
And some other woman is lookin' like somethin'
That might be good for you

Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you
Nothin's wrong
But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please baby can't you see
I'm tryin' to explain
I've been here before and I'm lockin' the door
And I'm not goin' back again
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make it go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you nothin's wrong
But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

And I made a promise
To you and myself and I don't know
I'm supposed to lose but I want to win
I don't know what else to do
But to keep on tryin'

Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you nothin's wrong
And I'm the only one who'll walk across the wire for you
And I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one
Verse One:
When I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the day ah when things were okay
They way we used to do it yeah do you remember back in the day
When brothers used to fly sisters used to sigh
And people were sincere to each other
When we were younger not a care in the world
Laid back happy goes and lucky
Was the term in 83 confunction rocking your box
Debarges singing on key yeah
We were dancing in the park
Playing hide and go seek tipping 40s on the curb
Big blue dodge playing my song
Yes indeed I reminisce about the days of old
With that oldie but goodie just playing in my stereo
When jocks were rocking stadium and parties were sincere
We used to hop janken boogaloo til broad daylight yeah
Back in the day when things were all good
I remember back in the day when things were all good
Back in the day when things were all good
I remember back in the day repeat to fade
Verse 1:

Love love love is sneakin' up on you
Love love love is sneakin' up on you

Verse 2:
You've been watching but you haven't spoken
And now you better speak your mind
Your heart has been officially broken

And you're feeling kinda blue
Love is sneakin' up on you

Chorus

Bridge:
Now baby don't you fight it

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Again" by Janet Jackson:

I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my mind
How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did
I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again
Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again
So here we are alone again'
Cause it's broken hearts that mend
I'll never fall in love with you again
How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

When all the love has gone away
And passion stares me in the face
What will I do
What will I say
How can I stop myself
From falling in love again
To fall in love again
With you
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I'll Remember" by Madonna:

Say good-bye to not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye to not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

Chorus:
And I'll remember the love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you changed me
I'll remember

Inside I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

Chorus

I learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess
I learned to let go I travel in stillness
And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember oh 

Chorus repeat
Love - Return to innocence

above the timberline  
where the path runs  
trough the heather  
to the mountain summits  
my heart is beating  

In harmony with the earth;  
observe the landscape  
urban noise fades  
or the memory becomes  
transparent  

Clouds sail afar  
a world without pain  
you flow in this moment  
and you realize: you are free  

Suddenly a breeze touches your face  
and feels the wind  
and the trees begin to sway gently -  
look at the sky  
the eagle soaring  

You are one with the universe  
undivided patterns of existence  
familiar voices appearing softly  
the starry sky extending infinitely  
against the sky -  

The sky is changing  
a million shades  
all the colors blend  
together in harmony -  
in the evening light  

Suddenly you're overcome  
a feeling of tranquility  
Suddenly the trees remain still  
through the crystal clear water  

You are one with the universe  
undivided patterns of existence  
familiar voices appear softly  
the starry sky extends infinitely

Verse 1:
There are questions in your eyes 
That I can see 
You're looking at me like 
I'm some kind of freak 
What you see in me is 
What I see in you 
And I know that it's true 

Chorus:
Understanding 
The way it should be 
Understanding 
One on one between you and me 

Verse 2:
I know that you've been hurt before 
But I swear I'll give you more 
Forget what you think you know 
'Cause baby it ain't so 
I'll never let you down 
And you will always be safe and sound 

Chorus:
Understanding 
The way it should be 
Understanding 
One on one between you and me 

Bridge:
So baby dry your eyes 
I'll never leave your side 
And that's a guarantee 
You can count on me 

Chorus:
Understanding 
The way it should be 
Understanding 
One on one between you and me 

Understanding 
The way it should be 
Understanding 
One on one between you and me 

Understanding 
The way it should be 
Understanding 
One on one between you and me
I would be happy to fulfill your request Please see the uncensored lyrics to "Come to My Window" by Melissa Etheridge below:

Come to my window
Crawl inside wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

I would dial the numbers
Just to listen to your breath
I would stand inside my hell
And hold the hand of death
You don't know how far I'd go
To ease this precious ache
You don't know how much I'd give
Or how much I can take

Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh to reach you

Keeping my eyes open
I cannot afford to sleep
Giving away promises
I know that I can't keep
Nothing fills the blackness
That has seeped into my chest
I need you in my blood
I am forsaking all the rest

Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh to reach you

I don't care what they think
I don't care what they say
What do they know about this
Love anyway

Come to my window
Crawl inside wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

I'll be home I'll be home
I'm coming home

Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face

Any time any place I don't care who's around
Mmm any time any place I don't care who's around


Wee-wee hours past midnight
Lying in a bed of flames
On a slow moving train
The rhythm of my hips
Baby you know I'm lovin' it lovin' it
I'm lovin' it lovin' it
Ooo on and on and on


Any time any place I don't care who's around
Mmm any time any place I don't care who's around


Wee wee hours past midnight
And I can't resist my appetite
Ooh I spy something I like
Ooh I spy something I like in my mind in my mind
Ooh I spy with my mind's eye
Ooh I spy with my mind's eye hmm


Any time any place I don't care who's around
Mmm any time any place I don't care who's around
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Amazing" by Aerosmith:

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy
To see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through
The pain
When I lost my grip
And I hit the floor
Yeah I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired
Of livin' a lie
I was wishin' that I
Would die
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings
Life's a journey not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk
I was out on the street
Just a tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
Oh it's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's a permanent vacation
The moment you wonder if you're on the wrong track ooh yeah
The life you lead is way too fast ooh yeah
So you look back to see where you are
But no one knows your name
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
Oh it's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts desperate hearts

I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind
All my friends call me Bear Claw
The Village Chea-to-whoa-wha
We drink all day and dance all night
I'm the man to see for a good time

I got a little strap
But don't let it fool ya
I'm a romantic guy
I'll take you if ya get too close to my fire
Oh and the pipes are callin'
From war to peace
I'm a man of a thousand faces
Chasin' down the street

My braves and I tore up town
We picked up Squaw and put her down
We went to war to keep the peace
ree-yee-yee-yee-yee-yee-yee
Then the politicians raped our lands
And scattered our tribes across the sand
Now I stand here with fire in my eyes
I'm the devil's son with a wild surprise

Stone-cold country by the grace of God
I'm a native son with a tattooed paw
And maybe "you can all go to hell"
But I will go down to my grave loving this land
Addressing the foreign language I do not understand
Like cowboys Indians and western settlers
We're all just someone's daughter's and son's

Well the railroad the White House and Washington
DC--the hired white man's thief yeah
Christopher Columbus and Tennessee whiskey
All came together one day
I seen it with my own eyes
A thousand times or more
I'll let you in on a little secret honey
A Locklear on the guitar

I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's a one of a kind
I'm an Indian outlaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
I'm a half-breed spawn
My baby she's a Chippewa
When it comes to love I'm a coyote ugly
My baby she's a Chippewa
The songdog of the plains

My mind's tellin' me no
But my body my body's tellin' me yes
Baby I don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess to you woo


I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong hoo
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong baby baby yeah


Seems like you're ready ooh
But are you ready for me
My body is yearning for a taste of your love
And I just can't wait to get next to you
Baby you can't resist oh
Just look in my eyes you'll see that I'm for real
The mood is right and I'm gonna make my move
So baby let's get into it ooh


I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong hoo Hey baby
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong baby baby


You say you're not a freak I'll prove you wrong
I'll have you skreakin' before too long
'Cause baby I'm determined to be the best ooh
I got your pleasin' guaranteed to pass any test
I'm a sexaholic I think they got a pill for this ooh
I mean I might as well be honest babe
'Cause you know I'm gon' get it anyway


I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong hoo Hey baby
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong baby baby


At the gym in the car at a park or behind the door
I'll make you scream ooh hoo
I'll create a sex war ooh
I'll freak you right I will
And I'll do it all oh night hey hey


I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong hoo Hey baby
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong


I don't see I don't see
I don't see I don't see
I don't see I don't see
I don't see see nothing wrong hey
I don't see I don't see
I don't see I don't see
I don't see I don't see
I don't see see nothing wrong hey
