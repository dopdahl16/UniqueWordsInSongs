Good day Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Candle in the Wind 1997" / "Something About the Way You Look Tonight" by Elton John:


Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
We were meant to be together
No matter what they say
I'll be here forever you know I'm here to stay

Wanna tell you I love you
Wanna hold you tight
I'm lost in your love tonight
And I won't leave your side

All these games that you play
They're driving me insane
You're always always always
Playing these foolish games

You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
You're my sunshine in the morning light
And I'm so glad you're mine

Wanna be with you forever
Wanna hold you tight
I'm lost in your love tonight
And I won't leave your side

All these games that you play
They're driving me insane
You're always always always
Playing these foolish games

You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
You're my sunshine in the morning light
And I'm so glad you're mine

All these games that we play
They're driving us insane
We'll play them forever
But we'll never change

Yeah this right here tell me why
Goes out to everyone who's lost someone
That they truly loved c'mon check it out


Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream that's right
In the future can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometime the night they took my friend
Try to black it out but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death


Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day day
When you went away
What a life to take take
What a bond to break break
I'll be missin' you


It's kinda hard with you not around yeah
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need uh-huh to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts big I just can't define can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits stages they receive you on
I still can't believe you're gone can't believe you're gone
I'll be missin' you


Every step I take every step I take
Every move I make every move I make
Every single day every single day
Every time I pray every time I pray
I'll be missin' you missin' you
Thinkin' of the day thinkin' of the day
When you went away when you went away
What a life to take what a life to take
What a bond to break what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you


Somebody tell me why
One gladys knight the pain inside
Guess every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray I'll be missing you
Every breath I take
Every move I make
Every step I take
I'll be missing you


I'll be missing you missing you
I'll be missing you missing you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'll be missing you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'll be missing you


Every breath I take
Every move I make
Every bond I break
Every step I take
I'll be missing you
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked outta my life

Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart my heart

Take back that sad word goodbye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked outta my life

Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart my heart

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked outta my life

Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my

Un-break my heart oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on
Verse One: Puff Daddy
Bad Boy
We ain't gon' stop
Now with Sean on the hot track melt like it's hot wax
Put it out all the stores bet you could shop that that's right
Leave a nigga with a hot hat fronting like bad boy ain't got tracks nigga stop that
There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nicknamed Puff Daddy my guns click louder than you niggas
Stopped the life that'll amaze you
Cash that I got would jump out the page at you
Make you Wanna be that gotta have that
Gold pieces all over my habitat
Jazz And to make matters worse
I'm a take your chick and claim I digged her first

Chorus: Mase Puff Daddy
Can't nobody hold me down ohh no
I'm a keep moving
Can't nobody hold me down ohh no
I'm a keep on dancing
Can't nobody hold me down ohh no
Verse Two: Mase
Bad Boys
Two-five the family
Two-oh-oh the Ferrari
Roof off I'm cruising
Mase be whylin' doin'
One-seventy-five honey's following
Repping BK to the fullest
Gats I pull it bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking
It ain't nothing they know Big be handling
With the mac in the Ac' been dubbed the mayor of the rap
Clapping the style packing forty cal
In the waist keep in check
Cause niggas think they safe but they not
Dressed in all black like I'm ready for the war
Haters start ducking as soon as I hit the door
Cause they know the life I live I'm bound to die
But fuck it I wanna leave a Goodfella's like my Lucianos
My destiny's to be what these niggas never were
Like a motherfucking Vernadad  that's no bullshit
My rhymes keep flooding it Germany might  flood and shit
Why you want to nigga to die so I can plug your shit
Bad Boys moving silence and violence
Take it from your highness
Chorus: Mase Puff Daddy

Bridge: Puff Daddy
Now it's called clean money I want to thank you
You made me feel so good wanna thank
All my friends in my life I wanna thank
And why y'all at it blow this shit up to the sky

Verse Three: Mase
Look at me now shoebox with the blue top
Stapleton is back and if you hear a click
Spray rounds through your Issac
Mase is no killer but more like a thriller
Pass the mic to the right nigga
The heavyweight holding the weight
Play straight you gotta love it cause you made the shit a hot line
And now you're afraid to say it
But your tapes bumping like a 30 shot gauge
Miss Clark I see you in your dark blueages
Hangin on the block all time with the flock
You know my slow flow and my smooth lyrics
Niggas say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cause my moms need that Lexus that new GS
And Lord knows I'm trying to give you
Whatever grands I can I don't want to be the one the fans love
But then again hate to see me getting grands
Verse One: Puff Daddy
Take that and rewind that back
Puff Daddy and the Family don't to it like that is ugh
Take that and rewind that back
Puff Daddy and the Family don't to it like that is ugh
Come on take 'em uptown to the westside
Harlem World 125 roc those bells
Verse Two: Mase
Yo' what's the prognosis why every other day
I feel like I wanna die that's why I can't trust bitches
Forgive me Lord I'm sinning I know I'm living wrong
If I stop selling crack I might be in the same song
That's why I wake up every morning and I kicks my game
Just like the niggas on the corners we all the same
Hoping and praying never I got to sling or draw
Cause being black hurts and that's the one thing I need y'all to know
Chorus: Mase Puff Daddy
Bridge: Puff Daddy 
I used AI programming to generate the uncensored lyrics of "I Believe I Can Fly" by R Kelly:


I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms


If I can see it then I can do it
If I just believe it there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly


See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes the silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me oh


If I can see it then I can be it
If I just believe it there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly


'Cause I believe in me
Oh if I can see it then I can do it I can do it
If I just believe it there's nothing to it


I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly believe it
I believe I can fly oh yeah
I believe I can fly believe it
See I was on the verge of breaking down down down
Sometimes the silence can seem so loud loud


I believe I can fly
I believe I can soar
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
What's it gonna be 'Cause I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
Have the right to lose control
Don't let go
I often tell myself
That we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon
It would all end
I live in misery when you're not around
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows
There'll be some love making
Heart breaking soul shaking
Love
Love making heart breaking
Soul shaking
What's it gonna be boy
Come on I can wait all night
Throw me down kiss me hard
Don't be gentle baby
Don't you let go
I often fantasize
The stars above are watching you
They know my heart it skips a beat
When I'm wrapped in your arms
Dancing to a slow melody
Darling I hope that you'll be
Whispering softly in my ear
Words that only we could hear
It'll be love making
Heart breaking soul shaking
Love
Love making heart breaking
Soul shaking
What's it gonna be boy
Come on I can wait all night
Thrill me chill me fulfill me
Crease me tease me until I can't deny
This loving feeling make me long for your kiss
Go all the way do it right
What's it gonna be What's it gonna be boy
What's it gonna be Will you hold me tight
What's it gonna be Make up your mind tonight
Hold me tight Tonight tonight
Love making Ah yeah yeah yeah
Heart breaking In my soul
Soul shaking Let me lose control
Take it slow Let me ask you again
What's it gonna be boy
Come on I can wait all night
What's it gonna be Don't let go
What's it gonna be Have the right to lose control
What's it gonna be Don't let go
What's it gonna be Have the right to lose control
What's it gonna be Don't let go
What's it gonna be Have the right to lose control
What's it gonna be Don't let go
What's it gonna be Don't let go
What's it gonna be Have the right to lose control
What's it gonna be Don't let go
Oh la la la mmh mmh

      And show you that I'm with that…

      Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit

You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "For You I Will" by Monica:


When you're feeling lost in the night
When you feel your world just ain't right
Call on me I will be waiting
Count on me I will be there


Anytime the times get too tough
Anytime your best ain't enough
I'll be the one to make it better
I'll be there to protect you see you through

I will cross the ocean for you
I will go and bring you the moon
Nothing is too far

Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling she's living she's golden
And she lives for me
She says she lives for me
Ovation her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile it's like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And now you see me now you don't
Now you need it now you don't
And you're back 'n' you're out 'n' you're up 'n' you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up

You You don't really want to stay no
You But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no-o
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Your wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight We break up
We kiss We make up

You you want in but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it
What is it
It's it

What is it
Repeat 4x

Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say "From each other"
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other

Hold me now it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know oh oh
Hold me now I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day from your body
Wouldn't wanna be swept away
Far away from the one that I love

Hold me now it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know oh oh
Hold me now I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you I promise to
You're gonna be the lucky one

When we get there gonna jump in the air
No one'll see us 'cause there's nobody there
After all you know we really don't care

Hold on I'm gonna take you there
Hold on I'm gonna take you there

Hold me now it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know oh oh
Hold me now I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

I can't let go

Now who's hot who not
Tell me who rock who sell out in stores
You tell me who's flopped who copped the blue drop
Who jewels got robbed who's mostly Goldie down
To the tube sock the same ol pimp
Mase you know ain't nothin' change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp guarantee
A million sales call it level three
I'ma come when I'm done collect your palm
Fee bahm do jokes by the hundred Aapollos I'm from
The school of hard knocks we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plots
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie baby


You know I'm We here to make you feel alright uh-huh
Get money We'll take you to the top now uh-huh
Yeah Baby baby uh-huh
One more time {We here to make you feel good} Uh-huh say what say what


Mad hoes ask Beavis I get nothin' Butthead
Stuck with "Chicka-Chicka-Chicka" {*gunshots*}
Oops my mistake let's cut to chase
Before the door kick down Biggie smurfed out hear the frankfurter
Ease pain migraine puttin' on the main
As the room spins uh I got the know-how to win
Gettin' them spins I'm in this shit for life
I get my paper and I dip I ain't a trick I'm a playa huh
Let's got this Workin' off in Burberry knickers
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre' puttin' it down for
Californ-I-A


You know I'm We here to make you feel alright uh-huh
Get money We'll take you to the top now uh-huh
Yeah Baby baby uh-huh
One more time come on now {We here to make you feel good} Uh-huh say what say what


B-I-G P-O P-P-A
No info for the DEA
Federal agents mad 'cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement


My team Supreme stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream I be that
Cat you see at all events bent Gatsby
Me and BIG Giddy-up baby we dizzy we party
Spotlight on us it's like a nigga robbed Liberace
Stiffly dim let's ride Biggie biggie singin' light
In mafia-style it's time to do it
Say what Yeah yeah Say what Unc
The Fort Knox dame Mase and the Pretty Boy
It's all to the curb for us you get your ticket for us
Gotta go-go-go-gotta go get that money Aww man

{We here to make you feel good} Uh-huh say what say what
When I was young I knew everything
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken sobbin' with my head on the floor
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice no

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
Now he's guilt-stricken sobbin' with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

We've tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lack in relationships
And how we're guilt-stricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip we'd say

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
We'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
Verse 1:
Anytime
I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal minds
And magenta feelings
Take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chica cherry cola

Chorus:
I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again
I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips
And the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to I want to

Verse 2:
Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you
But ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you
But ooh I'd die to find out

Chorus:
I'm the kind of person who endorses
A deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect
Is what I live for
But a look and then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction of a lover and mate
But the time of talking
Using symbols using words can be likened
To a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat

Verse 3:
Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you
But ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you
But ooh I'd die to find out

Bridge:
A the rain comes down
Wash this pain away
I keep thinking of you
Oh oh let it rain

Chorus:
I'm the kind of person who endorses
A deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect
Is what I live for
But a look and then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction of a lover and mate
But the time of talking
Using symbols using words can be likened
To a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat
Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you
But ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you
But ooh I'd die to find out
Hey yeah ya know what
I like the players
No diggity no doubt uh
Play on playa
Play on play that
Yo Dre drop the verse

It's going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
Attractin' honeys like a magnet
Givin' 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still movin' this flavor' with the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rough shakers



Uh I like the way you work it
No diggity I try to bag it up bag it up


The way you work it
I'm sick and tired of that same old crap
Blackstreet oh you know how to come right back
Passing up on those that try to diss you
You're missin' out on the women that's uh scora-fulous


Baby you got a perfect ten I wanna get in
And let me buy you a bottle of pinot grigio in exchange for just a little bit of lovin'
Frenchie and 'laudie from USC gave me action
That others found lovely but none could surpass you
You got class like the Ritz-Carlton
And chain like a Gamble and Huff track
But still playa haters wanna know who Sean and Teddy
Two to the one from the plan B
But why panic you philatelic

Teddy and Blackstreet it's no diggity


Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
No diggity we gotta bag it up
Reprise:
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
: Cause that's my peeps and we roll deep
No diggity we gotta bag it up


Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
: Cause that's my peeps and we roll deep
No diggity we gotta bag it up
:
Ay yo what's up
Yeah what's goin' on here
Sick and tired of five-o dead presidios
Hoping she could tell us where the bomb weed is
And that's where they went sixty-four impala
That's nice and take by baby daddy buy her
And yeah there was light from the lemonade sunny
And went back in the house and I'd gots my money
Verse 1:
Said I'm feeling good tonight
Finally doing me right
Just hanging with my friends
Won't let you mess it up again
But when I see your face
Heart starts to race
Can't resist your smile
You got me going wild

Chorus:
Every time I see your face
I feel like I'm in outer space
You got the power to hypnotize
I can never deny
That I belong to you
Every time I see your face

Verse 2:
I try to keep it cool
But you know I'm just a fool
When you're around
Can't keep my feet on the ground
I know I should move on
But you know I'm not that strong
Can't help the way I feel
Your love is just too real

Chorus:
Every time I see your face
I feel like I'm in outer space
You got the power to hypnotize
I can never deny
That I belong to you
Every time I see your face

Bridge:
I know it's crazy to hold on
But I can't help what I feel
You got me under your control
And I know that's not ideal
But I can't deny what we had
And the memories that we made
I know I should walk away
But my heart won't let me stray

Chorus:
Every time I see your face
I feel like I'm in outer space
You got the power to hypnotize
I can never deny
That I belong to you
Every time I see your face

Uh uh uh c'mon


Hah sicka than your average
Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink
Pink gators my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right if they head right Biggie there every night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underroos
Never lose never choose to bruise crews who
Do something to us talk go through us
Girls walk to us wanna do us screw us
Who us Yeah Poppa and Puff hehehe
Close like Starsky and Hutch stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M3
Bang every MC easily busily
Recently niggas frontin' ain't sayin' nuttin' nope
So I just speak my piece keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece thank you God with my peeps
Packin' askin' who want it you got it nigga flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit we on it


Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke and you're so paid


I put hoes in NY onto DKNY
Miami DC preferred Versace
All Philly hoes dough and Moschino
Every cutie wit a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie meaning who's really the shit
Them niggas ride dicks Frank White push the sticks
On the Lexus LX four and a half
Bulletproof glass tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last a nigga rappin' 'bout blunts and broads
Tits and bras ménage à trois sex in expensive cars
I still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for no car payment
At my arraignment note for the plaintiff
Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement shh
Face it not guilty that's how I stay filthy
Richer than Richie till you niggas come and get me


Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke and you're so paid


I can fill ya wit real millionaire shit I can fill ya
Escargot my car go one sixty swiftly
Wreck it buy a new one
Your crew run run run your crew run run
I know you sick of this name brand nigga wit
Flows girls say he's sweet like licorice
So get with this nigga it's easy
Girlfriend here's a pen call me round ten
Come through have sex on rugs that's Persian
Come up to your job hit you while you workin'
For certain Poppa freakin' not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin' like rapper demo
Tell em tell em friends like En Vogue
Tell them ho's I'm the one
Cutie pie with the light brown hair
Mo' sippin' Cristy attitude pissy

Who miss me Biggie Smalls
Can't do it like mix three
Been here for years rapin' up peers
Puttin' suckers in fears makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion overpowerin'
Over the competition I'm towerin'
Records shock when I put the voltage in


Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke and you're so paid


Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G Brucey B Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib same number same hood it's all good
Uh and if you don't know now you know nigga
You know very well who you are don't let em hold you down
Reach for the stars

It feels like heaven has opened up its gates for me and you yeah

And every time I close my eyes

Verse 1:
I long for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories
In time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

Chorus:
When I get close to you
I feel my heartbeat
Telling me that you're the one for me
Darling I don't understand
The reasons why
I can't be your everything
And you'll always be my sunshine

Verse 2:
As painful as it seems
I'll always keep dreaming
And memories of what used to be
So empty inside
Without you in my life
It's like a part of me has died
And I just can't hide

Chorus:
When I get close to you
I feel my heartbeat
Telling me that you're the one for me
Darling I don't understand
The reasons why
I can't be your everything
And you'll always be my sunshine

Bridge:
Time and time again
Loneliness is my only friend
And wishing well that
You'll come back to me
And start all over again

Chorus:
When I get close to you
I feel my heartbeat
Telling me that you're the one for me
Darling I don't understand
The reasons why
I can't be your everything
And you'll always be my sunshine

Outro:
My sunshine my sunshine
My sunshine my sunshine
Verse 1:
I remember when we used to hang
People thought we were burning up a shame shame
Cause we only wanted to do our thing
Living life like a movie scene
I was too young to understand
But now I see it's the way of a man a man
Cause every time you would come around
My heart would pound to the beat of the sound
Now I realize that you were wrong
And now I'm singing you this song

Chorus:
Why you gotta be so
Ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto
Don't you know I'm ghetto
Ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto
Why you gotta be so
Ghetto ghetto ghetto ghetto
Don't you know I'm ghetto

Verse 2:
I can do bad all by myself
Why you always bringin' me pain and hell hell
Can't you see you're the loser in this game
And I'm the one that's always runnin' game
Every time you take my love for granted
I'mma take somethin' from you for even havin' it
I ain't even 'bout to feel your pain
Cause you're the one to blame oh yeah
Now I realize that you were wrong
And now I'm singing you this song

Chorus:

And we can get down low and roll it round

Verse 2:

Cha cha real smooth

Chorus:
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
And we can get down low and roll it round

Verse 3:
That's what I'm talking about
We can have a party on the east bank
We can have a party on the west bank
We can have a party in the north bank
We can have a party in the south bank
It don't matter where we party
As long as we all get together
We can do this dance everywhere
And anytime you want to come get some baby

Chorus:
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
And we can get down low and roll it round
Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real don't be a stranger
We can achieve it we can achieve it

Come a little bit closer baby

'Cause tonight is the night
When two become one

Verse 1:
Finally see you're leaving
Gone somewhere to try to find yourself
I hope you find the answers that you're looking for
I also hope that you'll come back someday
To tell me what it was like
To live in the fast lane

Chorus:
See I'm waiting here for you
In my heart I'm sure
That you're the one for me
Don't you know or understand
That you're the one for me

Verse 2:
I miss you love like winter
I wish that you were here with me
But I know that I'm better off alone
Than loving someone who doesn't love me

It's hard for me to love you
When you won't love me after all
But now I'm finally through with you
And I'll be on my way to find
Someone who loves me for me
Someone who doesn't need to hide

Chorus:
See I'm waiting here for you
In my heart I'm sure
That you're the one for me
Don't you know or understand
That you're the one for me
Verse 1:
Everybody put your hands together
Whoo mmmm yeah
Girl I love you so
112 listen

Verse 2:
I’ve been checking you out
And I noticed that you ain’t just one of the crowd
There’s something special in you
Something that I want to pursue
So I’m offering myself to you
Cause I don’t want to be with nobody else but you

Chorus:
Cupid doesn’t lie
But you won’t know unless you give it a try
Oh baby true love won’t lie
But we won’t know unless we give it a try

Verse 3:
We’ve been friends for quite some time
And I hope you don’t find
That I’m crossing the line
Cause there’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To be close to you
Cause I’ve been feeling you
I don’t want to be with nobody else but you

Chorus:
Cupid doesn’t lie
But you won’t know unless you give it a try
Oh baby true love won’t lie
But we won’t know unless we give it a try

Bridge:
Don’t be afraid of what people might say
Girl I’ll never hurt you
I’ll never stop believing in this dream
Don’t let nobody tell you that love ain’t what it seems

Chorus:
Cupid doesn’t lie
But you won’t know unless you give it a try
Oh baby true love won’t lie
But we won’t know unless we give it a try

Outro:
Cupid doesn’t lie
True love won’t lie
Oh you get me ready in your 56 Chevy  
Why don't we go sit down in the shade  
Take shelter on my front porch  
The dandelion sun scorching like a glass of cold lemonade  
I will do laundry if you pay all the bills

Where is my John Wayne  
Where is my prairie song  
Where is my happy ending  
Where have all the cowboys gone  
Where is my Marlboro man  
Where is his shiny gun  
Where is my lonely ranger  
Where have all the cowboys gone

I am wearing my new dress tonight  
But you don't even notice me sayin'  
"Oh we've been out together  
Oh six months now"  
The candlelight I say "you look so nice"  
My stomach's butterflies  

Watchin' you's the wrong thing to do  
Oh sometimes I wish I was a star  
Sometimes I wanna be you  
Oh sometimes I wish I was a carefree lover  
But I was born a singer of songs

Where is my John Wayne  
Where is my prairie song  
Where is my happy ending  
Where have all the cowboys gone  
Where is my Marlboro man  
Where is his shiny gun  
Where is my lonely ranger  
Where have all the cowboys gone
Verse 1:
Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

Chorus:
She says days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
Into the fire
Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few small repairs she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

Chorus:
She says days go by I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
Into the fire

Verse 2:
Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years you always knew it
Strike a match go on and do it

Days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
Into the fire
Light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own and she's alright

Bridge:
Sunny came home
Sunny came home

Chorus:
Days go by I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
Into the fire
Light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own and she's alright

Outro:
Sunny came home

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Mouth" by Merril Bainbridge:

All the feelings you've been feeling
All the questions you've been concealing
Don't speak don't betray emotions
I'd kiss you but I dare not say

Mouth don't say nothing
I'm sure you're smart enough to say it
Mouth don't say nothing

Mouth don't say nothing

Mouth don't say nothing
I'll listen to your body tonight hey
Hey hey tonight hey

All alone on a Sunday morning 
Outside I see the rain is falling 


Inside I'm slowly dying 
But the rain will hide my crying crying crying 


And you 
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow 
Set this place on fire 
'Cause I'm tired of your lie 


All I needed was a simple "Hello" 
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry 
I I gave you my love in vain 
My body never knew such pleasure 
My heart never knew such pain 


And you 
You left me so confused 
Now I'm all cried out over you 


All over you oooh 
Never wanted to see things your way 
Had to go astray 
For why was I such a fool Why was I such a fool yeah 

Chorus: Allure & 112
Now I see that the grass is greener 
Is it too late for me to find my way home 
How could I be so wrong 


Leaving me all alone 
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno 
Romance of the century 
Tears of love 
all cried out 
all cried out 


And you 
You left me so confused 
Now I'm all cried out over you all cried out over you 

Bridge: Allure & 112

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Invisible Man" by 98 Degrees:

Verse 1:
It's funny how love can make you feel
Unsung heroes in your life
I'm grateful for the role you've played
And the love that you've given in times
With no one to turn to you're still by my side
And I never thought I'd come to this
And I I want to say that

Chorus:
Thank you for being my eyes when I couldn't see
And thank you for being my heart when mine was on the mend
And I I want to say thank you for
Everything thank you

Verse 2:
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were always there for me the tender wind that carried me
Light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

Chorus:
Thank you for being my eyes when I couldn't see
And thank you for being my heart when mine was on the mend
And I I want to say thank you for
Everything thank you

Bridge:
I hope that someday I can love like you
In me there's so much to prove
But as for now I want you to know
That I I love you

Chorus:
Thank you for being my eyes when I couldn't see oh
And thank you for being my heart when mine was on the mend baby
And I I want to say thank you thank you for everything everything
Thank you thank you thank you thank you
Verse 1: Lil' Kim
Check it I was born diseased grew up in Queens
Got a lot of enemies got a lot of dreams
Don't know where I'm goin' but I know just where I've been
Sittin' in the gutter with nothin' in my hands
Got nothin' to lose and the world to gain
From hollow points to tips to our own champagne
Puttin' gear on my man teachin' him my trade
When he come home 'cause I need to get paid

Chorus: Lil' Kim Da Brat Missy Elliott and Angie Martinez
Oh if tonight is not the night then maybe I will never be free
Nah nah nah if tonight is not the night oh if tonight is not the night

Verse 2: Da Brat
See I'm a Chi-Town girl wherever I go
I show ID from Kilwaukie to Idaho
But don't nobody know me though
Niggas might blow me ho-hum
But all they get is a Wham Bam
Might break a nail let Alone a sweat
I got no time for tail I got finesse and finesse
Ten k Karats on my chest
I'm elite Other bitches is scared of heat
But darlin' playa when you meet you'll see
I'm the queen bee laced with jewelry


Verse 3: Left Eye
Back back forth and forth let me hit that of course
I'm livin' life flawless let chatter cease
Ooh need a refill I keep a key
In the stash in the dash light the hash
When I ask bitch move that ass
I was raised in Atlanta came in the game with a hammer
16 shots wit' it just in case I have to cram ya
Whole sega with a Glock and a pager
No-nigga-bang-betta make him faint hit the floor
No fuckin' ASS TO MOUTH even for the house


Verse 4: Missy Elliott
Ay yo all I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones
The ones that been there from the start and will stay until it's done
We used to hold our head high now we get drunk and high
And party every weekend until we see the sunshine
I tried to be the one to take us get us out the ghetto
But we still steady movin' the product just like it's yayo
My homies from the 615 they always on my side
Bitch we nationwide from the East to the Westside
Grab my purse I'm 'bout to ride
Came a long way from the other side


Come on come on come on
Look into my eyes
Come on
Come on


Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
You don't see a damn thing 'cause you can't relate to me
You're blinded by our differences
My life makes no sense to you I'm the persecuted one
You're the red white and blue


Stereotypical thinking fueled by media hype
Images is everything and it's plaguing my life
And it's tough 'cause where I live everybody is a clone
Everybody's been stigmatized and harassed by the drones
And these judges they don't know how it feels to be a thug
Growin' up in the ghetto with the messed-up love
And then they judge-mentally make decisions rash
All in the name of the law in the name of God
And if this is what it takes to make history
Why then I don't wanna be in your mystery
They lethal injected Tim McVeigh in front of my eyes
And they didn't show the picture when McVeigh was fried
I feel like I'm wanted dead or alive
And my privacy's invaded who's watching me ride
I'm like a pitbull trapped in a cage
Fightin' for scraps and I'm starvin' for days
I'd rather be dead than a slave
And I won't give up what I got neither should you if you're like me


Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
You don't see a damn thing 'cause you can't relate to me
You're blinded by our differences
My life makes no sense to you I'm the persecuted one
You're the red white and blue


And I'm tired of livin' I feel it the way I'm living
Society's gimmicks I feel it the way they're thinkin'
Picturin' livin' in prison my vision been blurry
And all of the world is catchin' on fire
And I'm thinking 'bout how Frankie Grey died all that corruption and lies
It's hard to keep the faith when I'm targeted for strife
And my soul is in danger I'm tryna do right
Devil's up on my back but I'm tryna stay tight I'm in love with a warrior
Talkin' 'bout the heart of a lion it takes the fire in my eyes
And the look of desire for love to keep a struggler strugglin'
You and I can never be friends my homie I'm in love with my sins
All alone not by my side so I'm fighting alone
One hop now I'm a flop so it's okay it's all gravy baby
I'll never bow in my life still a soldier


Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
You don't see a damn thing 'cause you can't relate to me
You're blinded by our differences
My life makes no sense to you I'm the persecuted one
You're the red white and blue


Worldwide victims of a world that's violent and vicious
Done been murdered when will they ever cease damn
Don't nobody know what the hell is goin' on
A lotta brothers dying Lord help us all
Gotta be too black gotta be too white
Gotta be too wrong or too right
A little less fight a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart
A little more kindness a little less greed
A little more smile a little less speed
A little more love a little less hate
A little more peace a little less debate
Livin' in a sacred paradise
So cold so nice
But there's a way out of here
Something we all understand
And it's called love love love


Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
You don't see a damn thing 'cause you can't relate to me
You're blinded by our differences
My life makes no sense to you I'm the persecuted one
You're the red white and blue


Come on come on
Look into my eyes
Come on
Come on

I really wanna be with you I don't care what they say

Can you get it together Can you get it together
I wanna be with you forever I wanna be with you forever

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Living alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live all by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live all by myself anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live all by myself anymore

All by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live all by myself anymore

There were nights when the wind was so cold  
That my body froze in bed  
If I just listened to it  
Right outside the window  

There were days when the sun was so cruel  
That all the tears turned to dust  
And I just knew my eyes were  
Drying up forever  

I finished crying in the instant that you left  
And I can't remember where or when or how  
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made  

But when you touch me like this  
And you hold me like that  
I just have to admit  
That it's all coming back to me  

When I touch you like this  
And I hold you like that  
It's so hard to believe but  
It's all coming back to me  

It's all coming back it's all coming back to me now  

There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light  
There were things we'd never do again  
But then they'd always seemed right  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than all your laws allow  

Baby baby if I kiss you like this  
And if you whisper like that  
It was lost long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  

If you want me like this  
And if you need me like that  
It was dead long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  

It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me  
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now  
But it's all coming back  

There were those empty threats and hollow lies  
And whenever you tried to hurt me  
I'd just hurt you even worse and so much deeper  
There were hours that just went on for days  
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances  
That were lost to us forever  

But you were history with the slamming of the door  
And I made myself so strong again somehow  
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then  

But if I touch you like this  
And if you kiss me like that  
It was so long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  
If you touch me like this  
And if I kiss you like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  

And when you touch me like this  
And when you hold me like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  

It's all coming back it's all coming back to me now  

There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light  
There were things we'd never do again  
But then they'd always seemed right  

There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than all your laws allow  
Baby baby baby  

When you touch me like this  
And when you hold me like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  

When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
Then we see what we want to see  
All coming back to me  

The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall  
But it's all coming back to me now  

It's all coming back to me now  

If you forgive me all this  
If I forgive you all that  
We forgive and forget  
And it's all coming back to me  

When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
We see just what we want to see  
All coming back to me  

The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now  

It's all coming back to me now  

And when you kiss me like this  
It's all coming back to me now  
And when I touch you like that  
It's all coming back to me now  
If you do it like this  
It's all coming back to me now  
And if we

It's all coming back to me  
It's all coming back to me now it's all coming back to me now
Verse One: 

Boys and girls wanna hear a true story  
Saturday night was at this real wild party  
They had the liquor overflowin' the cup  
About five or six strippers trying to work for a buck  
And I took one girl outside with me  
Her name was Loni she went to Junior High with me  
I said "Why you up in there dancing for cash"  
"I guess a whole lot's changed since that"  
And if you don't know now you know  
I'm gonna take you home and let you juggle my show  


Chorus: 

My love is the shhh  
And I am your captain  
I'll take you around the universe  
And baby the rest is your majesty  


Verse Two: 

We got in the car and started driving  
Up the block weaving in and out of lanes  
Girls on the corner it's like we're clock-blocking  
And we're like "Damn but fuck it somebody's gotta do it"  
So I'm up all night hoping and wishin'  
And envisioning the things that we'll do  
And I'm also a cook and a good one at that  
And when it's time for breakfast I'm your early morning swallow  


Chorus: 

My love is the shhh  
And I am your captain  
I'll take you around the universe  
And baby the rest is your majesty  

Trina's Rap: 

Ah ha you know what it is  
And reign in the streets yeah that's my biz  
Stop Now let me tell you what Loni told me  
She said "The music made her lose control"  
She was shaking and singing "Dropping it hot"  
And when it hit the stop everybody clapped  
And they thought Loni was a superstar  
Until she got naked and hopped on the bar  
And then uh uh all the fellas buy her champagne  
And I'm asking every girl that can they run that game  


Chorus: 

My love is the shhh  
And I am your captain  
I'll take you around the universe  
And baby the rest is your majesty  

Tamara's ad libs: 

Baby don't you know my love is the shhh  
And I am your captain  
I'll take you around the universe  
And baby the rest is your majesty  

Outro: 

Don't be afraid to let me raise the tower  
'Cause boy I'll make you feel like a virgin again

Aiyyo let me take 'em back to the fuck room
And let 'em know Foxy Brown don't give a fuck dude
So what you got a gun Please understand
You can't work with the hands bitch you need a man
And not one two more like three or four
Niggas up in my doors must be out your rabbit-ass mind

This track shit I jack it like a crackhead
Like a dope fiend just to get a hit
Beefing with me 'cause the platinum won't quit
They think I'm slipping I'm bobbin' and weavin'
In the bathtub pouring champagne and we can
Do the damn thing brotha just ease up
Make it rough on these motherfuckers when you ease up
I suggest you sell a million more
It's like you try to diss us
Then you try to be us you're pointless
It's possible but not probable
I came trough the game with the amazing impossible
H-O that's just the way the game goes
You can play the roll or fold bluff or hold
Like poker we all on tilt champagne spilled
Some hardcore niggas now that's how you supposed to feel


I'll be I'll be
I'll be I'll be
I'll be I'll be
I'll be I'll be
Verse 1:
I've been long a long way from here
Put on a poncho played for mosquitoes
And drank til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Chorus:
Well ok I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

Verse 2:
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad
You get down real low down
You listen to Coltrane derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before

Chorus:
I come round around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again
Well ok I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

Verse 3:
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad
Somedays you're the windshield
Somedays you're the bug
Somedays you're the Louisville slugger
Somedays you're the ball
Somedays you're the windshiled
Somedays you're the bug
Somedays you're the statue in the park
Somedays you're the mark

Chorus:
Well ok I fooled you this time
Empty lake empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

Verse 4:
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad
In my life I see where I've been
I said that I'd never fall again
Within myself I was wrong
My searchin' ain't overover

I know that

Chorus:
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting
Somewhereoh yeah

If I can't believe that someone is true
To fall in love is so hard to do
I hope and pray tonight
Somewhere you're thinkin' of me girl

Yes I knowI know that

Chorus

Solo

So I'm cryin' just to see you again
Cuz I need your love need your loveoh
Yes I'm cryin' just to see you again
Cuz I need your love need your love

When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines
When you love a womanooh

Yo now everybody wanna wanna be a star 
But back in the day we used to chill at the bar 
Tryin' to get our heads together checkin' out the honeys 
Livin' life floatin' on the edge like a stuntman 
Me and Timbaland we used to do it all the time 
From sweet serenades to choo-choo trains 
Now it's about gettin' paid top grade sport 
And we smoke nothing but that high-grade top smoke

Verse 1:
Some people play the game of love
Like it's a game of chance
But every time you do
You roll the dice and lose
And though it seems like I'm playing
Foolish games
You know I'm trying to keep
My heart from being broken

Chorus:
I don't want to
I don't want to love him
I don't want to
I don't want to love him

Verse 2:
I got my own life to live
And I've got lots of love to give
But I'm not gonna waste my time
Trying to change someone's mind
And though I'm getting stronger
Every day
I can't help feeling
That I'm slipping away

Chorus:
I don't want to
I don't want to love him
I don't want to
I don't want to love him

Bridge:
Please don't tell me I'm wasting time
I don't want to hear that line
Cause baby I'm not blind
And I'm trying to be kind
But it's hard when love is blind

Chorus:
I don't want to
I don't want to love him
I don't want to
I don't want to love him

Outro:
I love me some him
I'll never love this way again
I love me some you
Another man will never do

They call me the gramma MC Lyte
And when it comes to rockin' parties
I'm a sure delight
I'm the reigning queen supreme with the expertise
And if the people don't believe me they should listen to this

I'm a captivating kind of lady boy
They call me Lyte L-Y-T-E
The MC homegirl from around the way
That's the one the one you want to play

But you're lackin' you didn't coordinate
When you're hot you're hot
And when you're not you're not
You're stuck you're just a fan
You hear them call my name out
As I rock the jam


Cold rock a party yo twist and shout
Lift your body 'til twist and out


I'm like a diamond shining like the sun
My rhymes and beats are recognized by every one
They recognize the mastermind the genius on the mic
For you it's an everlasting neverending delight

And when I'm dressed in yellow remember that I'm Jello
If that makes a fellow drop to their knees
It's not your fault you didn't know
You couldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole

And I even made hits when I was sleepin'
To other rappers I leave them all weepin'
'Cause in the battle of the sexes I have the upper hand
And even in my crew I am the commander-in-chief the man


Cold rock a party yo twist and shout
Lift your body 'til twist and out


Here I go here I go here I go again
Girls what's my weakness Men 
Okay then chillin' chillin' mindin' my business
I saw this couple rockin' steady
Tryin' to show out thought they was all that
Smack dab in the middle of the floor they was showin' their attack

I ain't mad at 'em baby do your thing
But behind the back of your good-lovin' man
You tried to kick to me Lyte the queen of hip-hop
Believe me sweetie I won't stop until 
I see police lights blazing hear the siren
But until then I'm gonna keep firin'


Cold rock a party yo twist and shout
Lift your body 'til twist and out
You're building a mystery    
You're waking up in his bed    
You're building a mystery    
You're checking out he's already dead    
You want it you need it    
It's what makes you feel alive    
You like it you love it    
It's what you need to survive    
Yeah it's what you need to survive    
   
He had a woman down in Carolina    
He said he loved her lord knows he tried    
She said "I'll love you every morning    
Give you children oh so many ways to die"    
   
Heedless of the danger    
And the stranger in his bed    
He loved his little whispers    
This is what she said    
   
"Oh I need you to understand    
I need you to understand    
There's nothing left for us to fear    
Nothing"    
   
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I    
I'm just trying to find    
A nice place for you and I    
   
He said "Girl you're amazing    
And lemme tell you you sure know how to surprise"    
He left me out in the hallway    
Amping all the way tears streaming down my face    
   
He said "Hey Baby why so glum    
Has the kitten got your tongue    
Don't you know that I'm the only one    
Who can make it all just go away"    
   
And they called me to come back  
Wherever I've been hiding    
Saying "Come back Sarah    
Come back to us now before he makes you go away"    
   
I'm just trying to find    
A nice place for you and I    
I'm just trying to find    
A nice place to go to and die
Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness soft spoken words

I love you always forever
Near or far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near or far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness a magical time

Say you'll stay forever and ever whoa whoa

I love you always forever
Near or far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

I love you always forever
Near or far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Say you'll love love me forever never stop
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah
Say you'll always love me forever never stop
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah

Love me forever and ever
Love me forever and ever
I love you always forever
Near or far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you

Say you'll love love me forever never stop
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah
Say you'll always love me forever never stop
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah

Love me forever and ever
Love me forever and ever
Just tell me if you want me to stop at any point

Just tell me if you want me to stop

I was living the life making moves staying in the spotlight
Everything was cool didn't have a care in the world
Then you came and turned it all around boy you got me twirled

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
that's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
through all the rain and the pain
you gotta keep your sense of humor
you gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit


Remember that
Never let 'em see you frown
Even smile when you down
Shit I frown when I'm crowned
Still Gotta find a way to

Can't help but overhearing conversations
H Lights stay on through situations
Big homie tell me what's the matter
Why is half the family scattered
Faced with hard times gotta use your mind
There's ways to survive gotta stay on the grind
Watch out for Jack's Police stick to your guns
And Ride for the ones that'll die for ya next time
Most of my dogs dead or in jail now
Thinkin' 'bout the stories that we shared tell how
Through out the years see them old scoob cats
The whole gang at your funeral faded off boot jak liquor
Let's make a toast to the dead
Tryin' to get by and stay fly
Cause they don't really know who we are why

Never let 'em see you frown
Even smile when you down
Shit I frown when I'm crowned
Still Gotta find a way to


I can't sleep
Niggas plottin' on me kill me while I'm dreaming
Wake up sweaty and screamin'
Cause I can hear them suckers schemin'
Probably paranoid problem is them punks be fantasizing
A brother bite the bullet open fire and I die
Holdin' my breath the world's wicked I feel it's fatal
Niggas dyin' over bullshit shell casings and stray bullets
Tragic I'm backstage tryin' to get mine
Somebody screamin': "It's Hammer Time"
What the fuck happened to the peace
First we march now we blastin' but what does it last
I found my faith disguised since the Young Black Messiah
In times of danger lives still go for you'll see
I'm an Outlaw representin' from Jersey to Cali
Don't cut your self short blowin' up like my nigga Wally Sow

Never let 'em see you frown
Even smile when you down
Shit I frown when I'm crowned
Still Gotta find a way to

What's on tonight
She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden don't think twice

You've gone a million miles
How far'd you'd get
To the bottom of her heart
You must've sweated a lot
You've salted every wound
And shown yourself brave and true
But what'll you do with the parts of her
That aren't the parts of you

She'll let you in her dreams
If you want to go that far
She'll let you in her deepest realities
But you gotta be a star
If you want to take her hand
And walk through the door
But if you want to take that secret love
Don't think twice it's alright
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "The One I Gave My Heart To" by Aaliyah:

How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad
Won't somebody tell me
So I can understand
If you love me
How could you hurt me like that

Verse 1:
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away
How could the one who said I love you
Say the things you say
How could the one I was so true to
Just tell me lies
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine

Chorus:
Tell me how could you be so cold
To go behind my back and call my friend
How could you be so foul
To hang me out to dry
And you never told me why
Tell me how could you be so ungrateful
After all the love I gave
Then you turned around and act so hateful
Stealing everything I made

Verse 2:
How could the one I gave my heart to
Turn around and break my heart
How could you have a conscience
If you let our love fall apart
Once upon a time we had it made
Love was just a breath away
You would hold me and say
Forever and a day

Chorus

Bridge:
I was the one who always believed in you
I thought you were the answer to the question
That was right on cue
My friends say "Girl he's playing you"
But I just can't believe the truth
You would never do that to me
Not to me

Chorus
Time keeps on slippin' slippin' slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin' slippin' slippin'
Into the future

I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly like an eagle
Till I'm free
Oh Lord through the revolution

Feed the babies
Who don't have enough to eat
Shoe the children
With no shoes on their feet
House the people
Livin' in the street
Oh oh there's a solution

I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly like an eagle
Till I'm free
Fly through the revolution

Time keeps on slippin' slippin' slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin' slippin' slippin'
Into the future

Time keeps on slippin' slippin' slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin' slippin' slippin'
Into the future

I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me

Big Momma thang back in the days
A junkie used to be my trade
In the alleyway I learned how to play
And pick up on kung-fu slangin' yay
Stayin' up late night still learning from Mystique
But my man put me onto Melle Mel and Ice-T
Now I'm onto money makin' after dark
Swimmin' in women made me wanna bark
That's when I got my first shot uhh
Nutted off then I wiped my nutts on the sheets
It was cool 'cause I already hit the floor
For the booty told her get the steppin' hit the door uh
Back to the money back to the porno tapes
Then {SFX} 'Put wiener in mouth' and caught a rape
Told him straight up front you know the deal
Be for real or get the cold steel
'Cause what you thought wasn't now it is
I'm the one that came so you can't put it out

Took trips with my dips to Montego

And when it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys pourin' down my page like rainfall
Got the whole crew askin' "Kim how's she doin'"
Made a little change but I'm still spendin'
And yo I'm still ridin' with my gun on my linen
Bumpin' Makaveli
Carryin' guns for John Gotti like a nail technician
Whoever said my pussy is best
Had they dick in they ass they're stressed
Confront that catch that blessed

Gettin' bent in clubs not givin' any fucks
We came to get the bucks coldest bitches and thugs

I don't wanna be a player
I just wanna be yours
Touching and kissing anything that you want me to do
'Cause I only wanna make you happy baby yeah


I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player I just crush a lot
But you know I'm still a ghetto child
So just give me a chance and I'll make you smile


I know you're feeling me
And I'm feeling you too
So what you wanna do
I'm ready and willing to do whatever you want me to
Just give me a sign and I'll be there for you


I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player I just crush a lot
But you know I'm still a ghetto child
So just give me a chance and I'll make you smile


I promise to always be faithful
Never deceive you but not just only when I see you
But every day in everything I do
So just give me a chance and I'll make it up to you

I'm not a player I just crush a lot
But you know I'm still a ghetto child
So just give me a chance and I'll make you smile

I just wanna be yours
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy
All around in my hometown
They're tryin' to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy for the life of a deputy
But I say
I shot the sheriff but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff and they say it is a capital offense
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time I plant a seed
He said "Kill it before it grows"
He said "Kill it before it grows"
I say
I shot the sheriff but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff and they say it is a capital offense
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot I shot him down
I say
I shot the sheriff but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff but I swear it was in self-defense
Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes one day the bottom will drop out
But I say
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy
Verse 1:
Every time I see you girl it makes me smile
When I look into your eyes I can't believe it's real
What would it take for you to see that I'm the one for you
I know I could make you happy if you gave me half a chance

Chorus:
You should be mine don't waste your time
On a guy who doesn't treat you right
You should be mine don't waste your time
On a guy who doesn't know your worth

Verse 2:
I know you've been hurt before but give me a chance
I'll prove to you that I'm the man you need in your life
I'll be there for you through the good times and the bad
You can count on me to never let you down

Chorus:
You should be mine don't waste your time
On a guy who doesn't treat you right
You should be mine don't waste your time
On a guy who doesn't know your worth

Bridge:
I don't want to see you hurting anymore
I'll be your protector your friend and so much more
I'll never leave you I'll always be by your side
Just give me a chance and let me show you what love is like

Chorus:
You should be mine don't waste your time
On a guy who doesn't treat you right
You should be mine don't waste your time
On a guy who doesn't know your worth

Outro:
You should be mine you should be mine
You should be mine you should be mine
I have often dreamed of a far-off place
Where a great warm welcome will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
When I goTo the distance I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope but I won't lose hope
Till I goTo the distance and my journey is complete

For a hero's strength is measured by his heart
Like a shooting star I will go the distance
I will search the world I will face its harms
I don't care how far I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

I will search the world I will face its harms
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

To the luxury car

And I know you love it when I talk
Real low in your ear
And you know you gotta follow
Directions in my ear
And I'm about to drive you
Wild girl
And Keith Sweat
Said it's okay if we get
A little twisted tonight

And the cool way to crawl
But this dance they call the shingaling
Really knocks me off my feet

Moonlight with you there beside me
All night doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad

Touched kissed caressed and held so tight

But when you're lovin' me
I can't make up my mind
'Cause you're so damn fly
I don't know what to do
Where do we go from here
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all you believed in me
I believed in you

Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dream to survive
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do

Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away

You must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side
How can I be any use to you now
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away

You must love me
You must love me

You must love me
*I hate the world today
You're so good to me I know
But I can't change
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
Must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one
I'm a bitch I'm a lover
I'm a child I'm a mother
I'm a sinner I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way
So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing
I'm a bitch I'm a lover
I'm a child I'm a mother
I'm a sinner I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way
Just when you think you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool you do what you do
And don't try to save me
I'm a bitch I'm a lover
I'm a child I'm a mother
I'm a sinner I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way
I'm a bitch I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way*

Ah ah
Ah ah


I know what you’re doing
I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline
When I kiss away your tears


You really had me going
Wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you
Are heavier by far

I believed in your confusion
You were so completely torn
It must have been that yesterday
Was the day that I was born


There's not much to examine
There's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious
If you have to ask me why


I say goodbye 'cause
You’re barely breathing
If you come back down
If you come back down
to earth


There's no use crying
You're better off without me
I'm not that kind of guy
There's no use crying
You're better off without me
I'm not that kind of guy
I Finally Found Someone by Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams uncensored lyrics:


I Finally Found Someone

Finally found someone to love
Finally found someone to care
I finally found the one to be with every night
'Cause whatever I do it's just got to be you

My life has just begun
I finally found someone

Did I keep you waiting I didn't mind
I apologize baby that's fine
I would wait forever just to know you were mine
You know I love your hair are you sure it looks right
I love what you wear isn't it too tight
You're exceptional I can't wait for the rest of my life

Finally found someone to love
Finally found someone who trusts
And when I close my eyes I know that you're still there
I could hold you close forever I swear

But would you do that for me yes I would
You're an exceptional person I think you're divine
Am I sensitive darling uh honey not quite
Thank you for loving me thank you my love

Finally found someone to love
This time this is it I know it's true
'Cause darling you're the one for me
I finally found someone

Finally finally finally found someone
I finally found someone who makes me feel like I'm alive
Oh yeah I finally found someone ooh oh I finally found you
Verse 1:
I don't have to think about it
I don't have to do without it
I just wanna say
That I love you and I need you
Day by day
Right now I am so confused
I don't know what to do
But I know I can't get over you oh no

Chorus:
Never make a promise to me
That you're gonna break
Never make a promise to me
That you're gonna break

Verse 2:
Yo yo yo now what's going on
You never call me you never come home
I sit and wonder baby all alone
How could you do this
I thought that we were on
Now all I can think of is how you make me sick
My mother told me "Son you'd better quit"
But I'm in love and I'm in tune
And I hope that I'll see you soon

Chorus:
Never make a promise to me
That you're gonna break
Never make a promise to me
That you're gonna break

Bridge:
Oh if you love me again
Oh I'll take you back
But from now on baby
Things will be a bit different yeah
I don't wanna be the one
That you played again and again
I just wanna be with you baby
In love until the end

Chorus:
Never make a promise to me
That you're gonna break
Never make a promise to me
That you're gonna break
Verse 1:
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinking
And smokin' or perpetrating
Let's get into this and stop contemplatin'
'Cause I'm in effect and you're not
And I'm just rockin' while you're yawnin'
But what I'm sayin' you know it's true
You'd like to think that you're crucial
The name is made to recite
And born to enlarge and excite
A certain height weight or size
You thinkin' of some voluptuous thighs
No that's not the real reason
The situation's that I'm teaching
You thinkin' about money
Well all money ain't good money
I'm sure you know that like you know Jimmy's is Gotti
You'll end up demented if you think you can stop me

Chorus:
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
M-m-m-murder spree killin' the ill
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
M-m-m-murder spree

Verse 2:
Yo I've seen the best of them
And they looked much worse than me
I'm cold freakin' dog blessin' the mic with the gods
The heavyweights of the world weigh-in and soul-hope
Deepest lyric ever written shine the light and then you know
The flow stays loc'd like I'm paid to smoke
Witcha big money pitch and your people's broke
My style is rich funk and symbolism
From the fly-world ways I'm the master of mixes
The dash of pimp juice and a ounce of pimpism
Rhythms and blues of words and weed
That's all I want when I'm needin' to feed
Livin' in the city it's do or die
I'm sayin' "huh" I can't hear you
World's runnin' too fast catch it if you can
I'm chillin' with my man smokin' hopin' that we don't get caught
'Cause it's illegal really don't matter
I never scatter brain it just tickles my fancy
I write a rhyme like I'm cookin' up candy
Some say I'm clever some say I'm crazy
Well I'm cumin' off just like the O G's and babies

Chorus:
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
M-m-m-murder spree killin' the ill
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
M-m-m-murder spree

Verse 3:
The world keeps spinnin' yeah and I'm still winning
I'm like Pretty Boy Floyd baby I'm a rainmaker
I bet it all I bet the bank or
Some say I'm crazy but I say I'm banker
One day you'll find me in a corner
On a street in LA
If you're lookin' for me you can find me
In the car wash or the Kurb Serv bellowin' "hey"

I'm just an honest merchant I'm lemonade a sellin'
Could be on the ledge or in the gutter might be in jail
The thing that you know is you don't never know
And everything that you get is everything that you give
Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest the weary so that they'll try to vex mine
Shippin' thoughts to a serene place
Well that's my duty and you can't fly without me
Catch the beat ride it don't stop
My man God bless him understands my likin'
And I'm just a addict addicted to a hip hop livin'

Chorus:
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
M-m-m-murder spree killin' the ill
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
'Cause you can't and you won't and you don't stop
Well you can't and you won't and you don't stop
M-m-m-murder spree
We'll be singing
When we're winning
We'll be singing

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

Pissin' the night away
Pissin' the night away

He drinks a Whiskey drink
He drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a Lager drink
He drinks a Cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times

Oh Danny Boy Danny Boy Danny Boy

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

Pissin' the night away
Pissin' the night away

He drinks a Whiskey drink
He drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a Lager drink
He drinks a Cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times

Don't cry for me
Next door neighbour
We'll be singing
When we're winning
We'll be singing

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're never gonna keep me down

Pissin' the night away
Pissin' the night away

He drinks a Whiskey drink
He drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a Lager drink
He drinks a Cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times

Sure please find the uncensored lyrics of "Last Night" by Az Yet below:

Last night you were so into it
You told me secrets that you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love

I drank your wine as you tasted mine
I kissed your lips you felt my mind slip
Into your soul I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night I was inside of you

Last night while making love to you
I saw the sun the moon the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night there was no planning it
It was so special and so very innocent
We talked of memories our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love

And deep into the night right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight in your soul
You felt incredible I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night I was inside of you
Last night I was inside of you oh yeah
Come inside of me come inside of me
Come inside of me come inside of me

I'll take you there I'll take you there
Wherever you want just say it and it's yours
Oh come inside of me come inside of me
I know your deepest wishes I'm a mind reader
You want it I'll fulfill it and you'll still be free
I'll take you there I'll take you there

Last night I was inside of you
It was so beautiful it was so beautiful
Last night I was inside of you
Last night I was inside of you oh yeah
Come inside of me come inside of me
Come inside of me come inside of me
It won't be easy you'll think it strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love after all that I've done  
You won't believe me  
All you will see is a girl you once knew  
Although she's dressed up to the nines  
At sixes and sevens with you  

I had to let it happen I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window staying out of the sun  
So I chose freedom  
Running around trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it to  

Don't cry for me Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance  

And as for fortune and as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired  
They are illusions  
They're not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you and hope you love me  

Don't cry for me Argentina  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance  

Have I said too much  
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you  
But all you have to do is look at me to know  
That every word is true  

Uh uh yeah


My life so crazy got me thinkin' 'bout it on a daily
I hustle hard for a livin' barely gettin' by but I made it
This game ain't easy but somebody gotta win
So why not me I ain't givin' up I'm goin' in
I do what I gotta do make moves no excuses
I ain't got time for losers only rock with winners it's useless
Tryna drag me down but I won't let 'em
I'll keep pushin' forward gotta keep on steppin'


Let it go let it go let it go Uh huh
Let it go let it go let it go Uh huh
Let it go let it go let it go Uh huh
Let it go let it go let it go


I've been through the ups and downs it's been a long road
People change friends fade but I got a few that I can count on
Money come and go but I'll always keep it movin'
I'll never sell my soul I stay true to myself that's my solution
Every time I fall I get up I keep on grindin'
Don't need nobody's help I'll do it on my own on my own timin'
I'll make it happen ain't no stoppin' me
I got a team with me we unstoppable that's the recipe


Let it go let it go let it go Uh huh
Let it go let it go let it go Uh huh
Let it go let it go let it go Uh huh
Let it go let it go let it go

I got this feeling 
And I just can't turn it loose

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Big Daddy" by Heavy D:


When I'm on the microphone the suckers lose hope
They just listen because my rhymes are so dope
The scenario I just paint so perfectly
The crowd is screaming just to worship me
I'm not conceited just convinced I'm the best
Yo the truth about me nobody can test
Born to rap raised to entertain
I'm the Big Daddy you know my name


Big Daddy Big Daddy Big Daddy
The one and only Big Daddy
Big Daddy Big Daddy Big Daddy
The one and only Big Daddy


I'm such a big man with the big hit sound
My rhymes are the size of a building downtown
Nobody can top the way I flow
When I'm on the microphone the crowd knows
I'm not a gangster or an outlaw
I'm just an MC who comes to raw
Listen to my voice you know I'm in charge
I'm the Big Daddy living large


Big Daddy Big Daddy Big Daddy
The one and only Big Daddy
Big Daddy Big Daddy Big Daddy
The one and only Big Daddy


I'm not a doctor lawyer or a teacher
I'm just a brother who's trying to reach ya
My rhymes are strong and my flow is tight
When I'm on the microphone everything is alright
I don't discriminate against any race
I just come to rock the whole damn place
So when you hear my voice you know the time
I'm the Big Daddy and I'm in my prime


Big Daddy Big Daddy Big Daddy
The one and only Big Daddy
Big Daddy Big Daddy Big Daddy
The one and only Big Daddy

Fantasy becomes a reality
And you're the only one I think of
It's like a dream when I think of you
Fantasy becomes a reality

I'm not sure if providing the uncensored lyrics of that song is appropriate as some of the language may be offensive or inappropriate for some users However I can provide the lyrics without any additional commentary or information Here they are:


I hitched a ride with a vending machine repairman
He said he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism I've never been there but the brochure looks nice
Jump in let's go lay back enjoy the show
Everybody gets high everybody gets low these are the days when anything goes


Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine


He's got a daughter he calls Easter she was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone why I'm a stranger in my own life
Jump in let's go lay back enjoy the show
Everybody gets high everybody gets low these are the days
When anything goes


Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine


Everybody gets high everybody gets low
Everybody gets bruised everybody gets sold
Nobody knows where it goes
We're all gonna be just a little bit broke
 Winding road

Verse 1:
I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off
I promise that you won't wanna get off

Chorus:
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

Verse 2:
Sitting here flossing
Peeping your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
Every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your thigh

Chorus:
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

Bridge:
If we're gonna get nasty baby
First we'll show and tell
'Til I reach your ponytail
Lurk all over and through you baby
Until we reach the stream
You'll be on my jockey team

Chorus:
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it

Outro:
Come on and jump on it
If you're horny let's do it
Ride it my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come and jump on it
