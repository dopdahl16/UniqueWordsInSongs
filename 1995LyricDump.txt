Verse 1:
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke fool
I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Chorus:
Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Verse 2:
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set-trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do or die what can I say
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24
The way things is going I don't know

Chorus:
Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Verse 3:
Power and the money money and the power
Minute after minute hour after hour
Everybody's runnin' but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it how can they reach me
I guess they can't they frontin' it's all a big hoax
To another day of monotony has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option failure's not
Momma love you but this trail has got to go I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot: feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

Chorus:
Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Outro:
Tell me why are we so blind to see that the ones we hurt are you and me
A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is "Baby it's good to me"
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Verse 1:
Yes it's me again 
And I'm back 
Oh I oh I oh I yeah 
Oh I oh I oh I baby baby 

Verse 2:
I creep with the cats the night 
I just hang while you sleep all day 
Got cha' 'cross town just to beep-a-me 
And wonder why I deal with cha' baby 
Can't keep cha' with my friends 
'Cause you don't know how to act 
So matter fact 
I be missin' them 
But cha' always come through with a hot one yeah 

Chorus:
I creep yeah 
Just keep it on the down low 
Said nobody is supposed to know 
So I creep yeah 
'Cause he doesn't know what I do 
And no attention goes to show oh 
So I creep 

Verse 3:
The 23rd of loneliness 
And we don't talk like we use' to do 
Now it seems pretty strange 
But I'm not buggin' 'cause I still feel the same 
I keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away 
Never go a stray 
If he knew he couldn't handle it 
It'll make him wanna leave me alone 

Chorus:
I creep yeah 
Just keep it on the down low 
Said nobody is supposed to know 
So I creep yeah 
'Cause he doesn't know what I do 
And no attention goes to show oh 
So I creep 

Bridge:
'Cause I creep around 
'Cause I creep around yeah 
I just can't help myself 
I don't want nobody else 
So I creep 

Chorus:
I creep yeah 
Just keep it on the down low 
Said nobody is supposed to know 
So I creep yeah 
'Cause he doesn't know what I do 
And no attention goes to show oh 
So I creep 

Outro:
Oh yeah yeah 
Oh yeah yeah 
Oh yeah yeah 
Oh yeah yeah 
Oh yeah yeah 
Oh yeah yeah
There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen
Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh the more I get of you stranger it feels yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
There is so much a man can tell you so much he can say
You remain my power my pleasure my pain baby
To me you're like a grown addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy baby
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen
Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh the more I get of you stranger it feels yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
And if I should fall will it all go away
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
There is so much a man can tell you so much he can say
You remain my power my pleasure my pain
To me you're like a grown addiction that I can't explain
Won't you tell me is that healthy baby
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen
Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh the more I get of you stranger it feels yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Yes I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh the more I get of you stranger it feels yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Here are the uncensored lyrics to "On Bended Knee" by Boyz II Men:

Darling I I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I guarantee that I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality

Every moment without you it seems like eternity
I'm begging you begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk I'll never walk again
Until you come back to me
I'm down on my knees oh baby
I'll do what I gotta do
I'll do what I gotta do
Just to prove to you
I'm on bended knee
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
Come back to me
Let's go back to the way it used to be
Can we go back to the days
I'm down on bended knee

Hope this helps
Oh when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me on
And on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me on and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
Only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and take me on and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby

This is how we do it
It's Friday night and I feel alright
The party is here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say "Monty yo we made it"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on before you go get paid
And let me hear the party say


I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
This is how we do it
South Central does it like nobody does
This is how we do it
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
This is how we do it
Let's flip the track bring the old school back
This is how we do it

This is how we do it all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an OG mack or a wanna-be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
A hundred-dollar bills y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is the party's underway
And let me hear the party say


I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
This is how we do it
South Central does it like nobody does
This is how we do it
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
This is how we do it
Let's flip the track bring the old school back
This is how we do it

I'm kinda buzzed it's all because
This is how we do it
South Central does it like nobody does
This is how we do it
YNV SCC all my homies
This is how we do it
I'll never come wack on an old-school track
This is how we do it 


I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
This is how we do it
South Central does it like nobody does
This is how we do it
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
This is how we do it
Let's flip the track bring the old school back
This is how we do it
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "I Know" by Dionne Farris:


I know I know I know
There's something deep inside you want to show
I know I know I know
You're hiding something from the ones you love the most


Walking round like you're 10 feet tall
When everything you say and do's just small
You've got a temper and it's oh so quick
And your self-esteem's not a big fat tick


I know I know I know
There's something deep inside you want to show
I know I know I know
You're hiding something from the ones you love the most


You're always talking on the telephone
Can't keep your business in your home
You've got a lot to say about the world today
So what about your life is it okay


I know I know I know
There's something deep inside you want to show
I know I know I know
You're hiding something from the ones you love the most


So don't be afraid to let me see
I'm here to help you overcome your needs


I know I know I know
There's something deep inside you want to show
I know I know I know
You're hiding something from the ones you love the most


You're hiding something from the ones you
We'll do

We don't even talk anymore  
And we don't even know what we argue about  
Don't even say "I love you" no more  
'Cause sayin' how we feel is no longer allowed  
Some people will work things out  
And some just don't know how to change  
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry  
We might watch our whole lives pass us by  
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry  
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives  
Don't do it baby  
Now they can see the tears in our eyes  
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts  
Well maybe that's a pain we can't hide  
'Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart  
Why do we hurt each other  
Why do we push love away  
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry  
We might watch our whole lives pass us by  
Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry  
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives  
Don't do it baby  
Don't do it baby  
Don't do it baby  
Oh they say that the road  
Ain't no place to start a family  
Right down the line it's been you and me  
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be  
Oh girl you stand by me  
I'm forever yours faithfully  
Circus life  
Under the big top world  
We all need the clowns  
To make us smile  
Through space and time  
Always another show  
Wondering where I am  
Lost without you  
And being apart ain't easy  
On this love affair  
Two strangers learn to fall in love again  
I get the joy  
Of rediscovering you  
Oh girl you stand by me  
I'm forever yours faithfully  
Whooa oh-oh-oh-oh  
Faithfully  
I'm still yours  
I'm forever yours  
Ever yours  
Faithfully  
I'm still yours  
I'm forever yours  
Ever yours  
Faithfully  
I'm still yours  
I'm forever yours  
Ever yours  
Faithfully  
I'm still yours  
I'm forever yours  
Ever yours  
Faithfully  
I'm still yours  
I'm still yours
Verse 1:
Let me lay it on the line
I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that a man has gotta feel with it with it
Don't make me chase you
Even do it tonight
Let me lace you up ooh the way I like it
Freakin' out freak out let loose
That is why I'm so exotic why I'm so exotic

To really love a woman
To understand her
You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought
See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
Ya know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's the one
She needs somebody to tell her
That it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really really ever loved a woman

To really love a woman
Let her hold you
Till ya know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her
Really taste her
Till you can feel her in your blood

N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
Ya know ya really love a woman

When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's the one
She needs somebody to tell her
That you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really really ever loved a woman

This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been rainin' since you left me
Now I'm drownin' in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby that's just me
And I will love you baby - Always
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you - Always
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh
And some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes I'm just a man
When he holds you close when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time
Yeah I will love you baby Always
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
And I will love you baby - Always
And I'll be there forever and a day - Always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I'll love you - Always

Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears

Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
Total eclipse of the heart

Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart
Listen as your day unfolds
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Lovers they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears
Stand up and be counted
Don't be ashamed to cry

You gotta be
Herald what your mother said
Reading the books your father read
Trying to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time
Some may have more cash than you
Others take a different view
My oh my
Heh hey

You gotta be bold you gotta be strong
You gotta be wiser you gotta be hard
You gotta be tough you gotta be cool
You gotta be calm you gotta stay together
All I know all I know love will save the day

Herald what your mother said
Reading the books your father read

Hey hey ah

You gotta be bold you gotta be strong
You gotta be wiser you gotta be hard
You gotta be tough you gotta be cool

All I know all I know love will save the day

Time asks no questions it goes on without you
Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace
The world keeps on spinning
You can't stop it if you try to
This time it's dangerous
We will win
Why not take a chance

You gotta be bold you gotta be strong
You gotta be wiser you gotta be hard
You gotta be tough you gotta be cool
You gotta be calm you gotta stay together
All I know all I know love will save the day

You gotta be wiser you gotta be hard
You gotta be tough you gotta be cool
You gotta be calm you gotta stay together
All I know all I know love will save the day
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone 'lone
Why 'lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

With a little love
And some tenderness
We'll walk upon the water
We'll rise above this mess


With a little peace
And some harmony
We'll take the world together
We'll take 'em by the hand


'Cause I got a hand for you
'Cause I wanna run with you
Yesterday I saw you standing there
Your head was down your eyes were red
No comb had touched your hair


I said "Get up and let me see you smile
We'll take a walk together walk the road awhile
'Cause I got a hand for you
I've got a hand for you
'Cause I wanna run with you"


Won't you let me run with you
Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to a place where you can be


Anything you wanna be because
I wanna love you the best that
The best that I can
See I was wasted and I was wasted
And I was wasting time until I thought about your problems
I thought about your crimes then I stood up
And then I screamed aloud
I don't want to be part of your cowed crowd


Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to a place where you can be
Anything you wanna be because
I wanna love you the best that
The best that I can


Say want to put my arms around you
Feel your breath in my ear
You can bend me you can break me
But baby don't forsake me


Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to a place where you can be
Anything you wanna be because
I wanna love you the best that
The best that I can


Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to a place where you can be
Anything you wanna be because
I wanna love you the best that
The best that I can

First things first I pop freaks all the honeys
Dummies Playboy bunnies those wantin' money
Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get Nathan
But penetration unless it smells like sanitation
Garbage I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never Black and ugly as ever
However I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet
Stop it if you think you're gonna make a profit
Outro I won't let you even see me if I don't owe you
I blow you to smithereens
Crenshaw and Slauson I mean
You might catch me in a G ride 'cause I'm slippin' slide
In a take-a-back-seat-ride
And I'm just a driver till the homie arrives
Then I'm on the side of the road tryna hide
From jake of stick-up kids who try to rob me
Of couse they wanna rob me they wanna kill me
Cause of the things I know they can't reveal me
So you ain't even real to me punk
You just a circumstance of my prosperity
So now that I'm here I've got a whole new career
I went from havin' rocks in my socks to havin' poocks on my wrist
This year's the Lynx next year's the Roar
Last year I was the most anticipated
But the ball dropped I hope your little punk rump
I see bones and I'm out cause All Eyez is on me homey


One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance
One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance
One more chance

I had this girl 'cause down for me
Not havin' money but she was a street honey
Used to tell me all the time "Baby boy stay on your grind
And a young one day you'll be a man
And look back and say"
"Damn I was just a fan"
A way to downplay it I'm sayin'
What's cocked without a plan
You know the drill
I'm from the Ville plus down in the Hill
Plus right around the way from Brownsville
So death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do or die what can I say
I'm 23 now will I live to see 24
The way things is going I don't know
Tell me why are you so paranoid
Don't be so paranoid
Premier cuts "Don't be so"
Premier cuts "Don't be so"
Aight Hahaha

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Candy Rain" by Soul for Real:


My love do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops
You're the same my candy rain


Have you ever loved someone
So much you thought you'd die
Giving so much of yourself
It seems the only way
Tell me what you want and I
And I will give it to you
'Cause you are
My love do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops


You're the same my candy rain
My love did you ever dream
That it could be so right
I never thought that I would find
All that I need in life
All I want all I need now I know
I know I found it in you
I found it in you


You're the same my candy rain
My love do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops
You're the same my candy rain


If you should ask me
Just how much I love you
Don't you know I'll always
Be true
Look into my eyes
You'll see
That you're the only one for me


Candy rain coming down
Taste you in my mind and
Spreading all around
Candy rain you're the one
You make my love rain down
You're my candy rain


My love do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops
You're the same my candy rain
She sits alone by a lamp post
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says "Dad's the one I love the most but
Stipe's not far behind"

She never lets me in
Only tells me where she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I say that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God you gotta help me fly away

And just let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing if it eases all her pain
Let her go let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be let her be

This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standing by the phone
Saying maybe maybe I'll be back some day
I wanted to look for you
You walked in I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself

Say "Let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing if it eases all her pain let her go
Let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be"

Last night I tried to leave
Cried so much I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried
Yelling oh mama please help me

Won't you hold my hand and see
Let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing if it eases all her pain
Let her go let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be
Let her cry if the tears fall down like rain
Let her go let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow let her be
Verse 1:
I believe in every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for every heart that whispers love
Someone somewhere hears
I believe that someday I'll find my way
Back to you my dear

Chorus:
'Cause I believe yes I believe
With all the joy and pain that love can bring
'Cause I believe

Verse 2:
I believe that anything is possible
If we just try
I believe that someday we're gonna find
The reason why
I believe for every door that closes
One more opens wide
I believe that we can all be friends
No matter what's outside

Chorus

Bridge:
I believe in one God above
And I believe that we reap what we sow
Don't you think that life is like a mirror
Reflecting all the love we show

Chorus
Take a good look at it
Look at it now
Might be the last time you'll
Have a go 'round
I’ll let you touch it if you'd
Like to go down
I’ll let you go further
If you take the southern route

Don't go too fast
Don't go too slow
You've got to let your body
Flow

I like the feelin'
You're givin' me
Just hold me close
Don't let me go

I'm not worried
I'm not frightened
I'm not scared
I'm just horny

On the B-R-E-A-S-T-S
Love to see you
Pee on me
Give me some of your
T-A-R-T
Why don't you
Rub your fingers
Down my spine
Gitchi gitchi ya-ya da-da

Gitchi gitchi ya-ya here
Mocha chocolate what
Real lady lovers what
S** is a fact of life what
Kickin' s** ain't no trick what

We both have the need for each other’s
Breasts to suck
Give me chance to
Remember how much
You like me

Like I like you
And go down
On your body once again

I will provide the uncensored lyrics of "Strong Enough" by Sheryl Crow as requested:

God I feel like hell tonight
Tears of rage I cannot fight
I’d be the last to help you understand
Are you strong enough to be my man

Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
'Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man

Lie to me I promise I'll believe
Lie to me but please don't leave
I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
It's try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man

When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Would you be man enough to be my man

Lie to me I promise I'll believe
Lie to me but please don't leave
Can't face the truth so I pretend
Everythings alright
When in reality it's crumbling within
Are you strong enough to be my man

Are you strong enough to be my man
Are you strong enough to be my man

Don't even like to think about it
I don't know what I would do without it

Verse Two: Yukmouth
I take sacks to the face whenever I can
Don't need no crutch I'm so keyed up
Till the joint be burnin' my hand next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slopes so the ashes won't be burnin' up my hand brah
Hoochied up my nigga let me hit it yo
Passed it to the left and I'm feeling about ninety
I'm feeling kinda hungry because my throat is kinda dry
We're raiding right now so just pass me the alpine
Feeling kinda boofy laid back in my seat

Steady coastin' tryin to smash through the tunnel
But I'm not really worried cause I got to know
Repeat Chorus

Verse Three: Numskull
Let's go half on a sack

Verse 1:
Loneliness is what I feel
Sometimes it's better not to talk at all
About the way I feel
The day will come when I'll have courage to rise above this
And into the world I know
My mind and heart will guide me

Pre-chorus:
I will get up and run away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky

Chorus:
I will run away
I will run away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky

Verse 2:
Time moves on and heals the wounds
But memories will never fade away
The pain I feel inside
The day will come when I'll have the courage to rise above this
And into the world I know
My mind and heart will guide me

Pre-chorus:
I will get up and run away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky

Chorus:
I will run away
I will run away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky

Bridge:
This time I won't regret the chances that I take
The world is mine to hold this time I won't break
It's time to spread my wings and fly
Get up and run away

Chorus:
I will run away
I will run away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky

Outro:
I will run away
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why we sleep at all
The morning sun is shining through
And I can't hide from you
And why does it matter

Cause I'm covered by the way you
Take me high
And you take me high

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
And I will feel no fear
I'll close my eyes under your prayer
And I will wake up there
Oh I will wake up there

Oh I will wake up there
Oh I will wake up there

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
And I will feel no fear
I'll close my eyes under your prayer
And I will wake up there
I will wake up there
I will wake up there
I will wake up there
Verse 1:
I'll admit it it's been kinda hectic
Two weeks ago you said you love me
Now you say you're regretting it
Love connection ain't no connection
When you're in love you'll do anything
And some women cling to make a man stay
So I tell you right now if it happens again
I won't be around

Chorus:
He's mine you may have had him once
But I got him all the time
He's mine you may have had him once
But I'm the one he loves

Verse 2:
Everytime you see us together
You can't stand it honey you can't stand it
If I were you I'd take heed to my movement
Cause things ain't always quite what they seem
I'd hate to be in your shoes
Cause being in love with a man like mine
Is a hard pill to swallow
So you wanna be cool instead of being his fool
Girl didn't you know didn't you know uh

Chorus:
He's mine you may have had him once
But I got him all the time
He's mine you may have had him once
But I'm the one he loves

Bridge:
He might give you diamonds
But I'll be the one to treat you right
He'll be the one to love you through the night
But I'll be the one he comes to in the morning light

Chorus:
He's mine you may have had him once
But I got him all the time
He's mine you may have had him once
But I'm the one he loves
Certainly Here are the uncensored lyrics of "December" by Collective Soul:

Why drink the water from my hand
Contagious as you think I am
Just tilt my sun towards your domain
Your cup runneth over again

Don't scream about
Don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby
Just spit me out

Don't worry about
Don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby
Just spit me out

Why follow me to higher ground
Lost as you swear I am
Don't throw away your basic needs
Ambiance and vanity

December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing

Don't scream about
Don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby
Just spit me out

Don't worry about
Don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby
Just spit me out

Why follow me to higher ground
Lost as you swear I am
Don't throw away your basic needs
Ambiance and vanity

December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing

Yah yah yah
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
Yo this song yo this song is dedicated
To all the happy people all the happy wives
And all the happy husbands
Yo check it out


We gonna take y'all back on this one y'all

Ya know what I'm sayin

And things I've seen there
So listen very carefully y'all


I'll be there for you
You're all I need to get by
I'll be there for you
You're all I need to get by


Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl it's me in your world believe me
Nothin' make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nuttin' you made a brother feel like he was somethin'
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin'
Even when the skies were gray you would rub me on my back and say
"Baby it'll be okay"
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my coochie away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live in a fat-ass crib
With thousands of kids word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin' in the effin' lap of luxury
I'm realizin' that you didn't have to funk with me
But you did now I'm goin' all out kid
And I got mad love to give you my nigga


I'll be there for you
You're all I need to get by
I'll be there for you
You're all I need to get by


For real you know what I'm sayin'
'Cause I rain on the world
Knowhatimsayin With the Gods on a good day
But sometimes the rain you know
Can be controllable like
Y'all be talkin' off the head we be talkin' through the dread
Yo y'all be hoggin' the mics we hog the game
But it's all the same we all want to take a bite of the apple
Norman Bates with a briefcase turnin' men to mice
I'm that slice of life y'all niggas know me
When it comes to women yo we got the same thing in common
Gettin' burnt by the same sun gettin' dried by the same wind
The end is the beginning and the beginning is the end

Please find the uncensored lyrics below as requested:

Please baby can't you see
My mind's a burnin' hell
I got razors a rippin' and tearin' and strippin'
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for something new
And some other woman is lookin' like something
That might be good for you

Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you
Nothin's wrong
But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please baby can't you see
I'm trying to explain
I've been here before and I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make
It go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you
Nothin's wrong
But I'm the only one who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

And I made a vow
I'm never gonna love you
Now I'm standin' out in the rain
Listenin' to the words you're sayin'

Turnaround and walkin' away
From everything I thought we had
You gotta hold on
Hold on to what you got
When all you got is nothin'
You're right
I'm the only one

Who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Every Little Thing I Do" by Soul for Real:


Every little thing I do you're on my mind
Every little thing I do you're in my heart
Every little thing I do I think of you

The thought of you and me alone sends chills right through my bones
I'm down to ride this love I feel is all I've ever known
Through thick and thin I'll stand by you my love will never end
So deep inside my heart you'll always be my friend


Every little thing I do you're on my mind

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Before I Let You Go" by Blackstreet:


Before I let you go before I let you go oh baby I gotta know I gotta know should I stay or should I go
Before I let you go before I let you go oh baby



I can't picture living life without you
And I'd probably do anything to prove I adore you
Whether it's wrong or right I'll keep loving you through the night
Even if you can't see it I'll still be by your side



Before I let you go before I let you go oh baby I gotta know I gotta know should I stay or should I go
Before I let you go before I let you go oh baby



Now they say when you find somebody
Then you better hold on tight
Them say when you find your special lady
Then you better treat her right
Now I was blind to see
That you were the one for me
Now I'm down on my bended knee
Giving all my love to thee



Before I let you go before I let you go oh baby I gotta know I gotta know should I stay or should I go
Before I let you go before I let you go oh baby



Yeah yeah yeah
Yo I'm not the kind of guy to play emotions
But every time I try to say goodbye I choke
Try to walk away end up running back
How can you mend a heart that's been broke
Time and time again I prayed about our relation
But every time I contemplate I get frustrated
I'm slowly slipping into a depression
Girl you got the best of my profession



Before I let you go before I let you go oh baby I gotta know I gotta know should I stay or should I go
Before I let you go before I let you go oh baby



I don't want to have to let you go
But baby gotta let you know
I don't want to have to let you go
But baby gotta let you know know know

Girl whatever you ask me you know I can do


Baby tonight is your night
And I will do you right
Just make a wish on your night
Anything that you ask

I will give you the love of your life

Verse One:
You are appreciated
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school; scared to go home I was a fool
with the big boys breaking all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused; it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary
Heeeey I see the penitentiary one day
And runnin' from the police that's right
Mama catch me put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend Mama
You always was a black queen Mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed a poor single mother on welfare tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Chorus:
Lady
Don't cha know we luv ya Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated

Verse Two:
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless but all along
I was lookin' for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin' with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Chorus:
Lady
Don't cha know we luv ya Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated

Verse Three:
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything'll be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Chorus:
Lady
Don't cha know we luv ya Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Hold On" by Jamie Walters: 

Thinkin' 'bout the day when we first met
We were so young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end

But now here we stand trying to mend something
Broken and oh baby it's not easy All I know is we're both to blame
And I'm not we're not trying to play any games

Hold on it's never easy
To start all over again
This time we'll take it slow

Just a kiss a simple touch
Will be enough to set it off
And before you know you'll be in love

You know I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you
Baby I'll do what I have to
To prove I can be the one you need

I'll be there
Chorus
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't wanna hate you

I don't wanna take you
But I don't wanna be the one to cry
That don't really matter to anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

Hold on it's never easy
To start all over again
This time we'll take it slow

Just a kiss a simple touch
Will be enough to set it off
And before you know you'll be in love

You know I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you
Baby I'll do what I have to
To prove I can be the one you need

I'll be there
Chorus x2

Yeah… what up this is Dr Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday


Bitches creepin'
They sweepin' ya off ya damn feet
Just keep they heads ringin'

I'm still gettin' funky like a boogie woogie
Wonderin' if you niggas knew me
You can't see the D but I'm in the cut
And I'm ridin' with Doc and Monk y'all niggas shut the fuck up
While we ride to this beat
Bitches yellin' "Too $hort the beats will last forever"
And I hope that's true
'Cause we still ridin' on 22's
Bumpin' music by the Pound and Heavy D
Girls with green eyes and fly weaves
Ass out booty fat no doubt
Tryin' to take a nigga out and that's the real
Though they keepin' the weight with the pill
I got my hustle down pat
In 1995 I be able to buy the whole hood rat pack
And that's real


Bitches creepin'
They sweepin' ya off ya damn feet
Just keep they heads ringin'


Now I'm hittin' MC's and jokes roll 'em
Like they rolled up on my very first case I shook 'em
And the bitches are watchin' and jockin' the style Say what
From a distance but they can't hear the funk
I'm kickin' more than dust in the sandbox
And I plan to keep the whole world dancin'
So entertain me as I continue to rip ya
And we keep the party movin' steady dippin'
In a '64 ridin' shotgun
And I'm still Dre ain't got a damn thing done
And my game is tight like the Nubian queen
Motherfucker keep they head ringin'


Bitches creepin'
They sweepin' ya off ya damn feet
Just keep they heads ringin'


Now let me loosen up my collar
And make my way to the microphone
'Cause my money's gettin' larger
And it's time to go home
And I'm outta control
But it's a short ride from good to bad
I never call but I hope they don't be blowin' up my phone
And that's realer than real deal Holyfield
And now you hookas and hoes know
How I feel well it's the nigga from the CPT
On a mission for peace
And you ain't heard the last of A to the muthafuckin' K
And like I say niggas can't see me see me
And that's how it's gon' always be
And I'm down with the capital G


Bitches creepin'
They sweepin' ya off ya damn feet
Just keep they heads ringin'
This is the uncensored lyrics of "The Rhythm of the Night" by Corona:


This is the rhythm of the night
The night oh yeah


You could put some joy upon my face
Oh sunshine in an empty place
Take me to turn to and babe I'll make you stay


Oh I can ease you of your pain
Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go each time I hear you say


This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah


This is the rhythm of my life
My life oh yeah
You could put some joy upon my face
Oh sunshine in an empty place
Take me to turn to and babe I'll make you stay


Oh I can ease you of your pain
Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go each time I hear you say


This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah


This is the rhythm of my life
My life oh yeah
This is the rhythm of the night
The night
Oh yeah this is the rhythm of my life
Look around your world pretty baby

Is it everything you hoped it'd be

The wrong guy the wrong situation

The right time to roll to me

Roll to me

And I believed I was yours

But you got tangled up in your fears

When I said that I'd be yours

It was forever no tears

And I believed you could love me

And forever we would be

So roll to me roll to me

And I would open my arms and I would open my arms

And I would close my eyes and say

Love is a poor man's food

Don't prophesize

Choose your weapon wise

Me I've got my force fields for flies

Speak to me

Can I climb your tree

Wipe the cobwebs from your eyes

Roll to me roll to me

And I would open my arms and I would open my arms

And I would close my eyes and say

Love is a poor man's food

Don't prophesize

Choose your weapon wise

Me I've got my force fields for flies

Don't prophesize

Choose your weapon wise

Love is a precious thing to waste
Verse 1:
Every time I close my eyes I wake up feeling so horny
I can't get you outta my mind sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else freek'n you is all I need

Chorus:
I want to freek you repeat 4x

Verse 2:
I dream of us together enjoying each other's company
I don't want to fuss and fight just want to make it right
There's no one else but you can't deny what I'm going through
I don't care what they say I want to love you any way

Chorus:
I want to freek you repeat 4x

Bridge:
I need your body I need your body baby tonight is the night
I want to freek you I want to freek you
I need your body I need your body baby to make it right
I want to freek you I want to freek you
Can you freek me Can you freek me baby until the morning light
I want to freek you I want to freek you
I'll take care of you I'll take care of you baby and you'll see that it's all right
I want to freek you I want to freek you

Chorus:
I want to freek you repeat 4x

Outro:
I don't care what they say I don't care what they do
Just want to freek you repeat until fade

I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked a I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a '64 Impala


I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I could get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go and even in my dreams
I can scheme a way to make her mine


'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their men ball


Dag y'all I never understood black
Why the jocks get the fly girls
And me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em "Scat skittle scabobble"
Got hit with a bottle
And put in the hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame when you livin' in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcome with thoughts of me and her together
Right So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type
I wished I was a little bit taller
I wished I was a baller
I wished I had a girl who looked a-I would call her
I wished I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a '64 Impala


I wished I was a little bit taller
I wished I was a baller
I wished I had a girl who looked a I would call her
I wished I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a '64 Impala


What I'm gonna do with a gun rack
I need a gun rack like I need an 'Ir' for my truck
Verse 1:
I believe in love it's all we got
Love has no boundaries costs nothing to touch
War makes money cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Chorus:
Churches and dictators politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later
But love I believe in love
I believe in love it's all we got
Love has no boundaries no borders to cross
Love is simple hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Chorus:
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone
Without love I believe in love
Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me
Without love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love

I've walked these streets
A virtual stage
It seemed to me
Makeup on their faces
Actors took their places next to me


I've walked these streets
In a carnival
Of sights to see
All the cheap thrill seekers
The vendors & the dealers
They crowded around me


Have I been blind
Have I been lost
Inside myself &
My own mind
Hypnotized
Mesmerized
By what my eyes have seen


I've walked these streets
In a spectacle
Of wealth & poverty
In the diamond market
The scarlet welcome carpet
That they just rolled out for me


I've walked these streets
In the madhouse asylum
They can be
Where a wild-eyed misfit prophet
On a traffic island stopped &
He raved of saving me


Have I been blind
Have I been lost
Inside myself &
My own mind
Hypnotized
Mesmerized
By what my eyes have seen


I've walked these streets
In the simmering summer
The heat has cracked the sidewalks
Endless neon advertisements
In the midst of everything
They offer solitude - and medication


Marijuana - Prozac - Valium - Nicotine
Valium - Nicotine - Caffeine - Marijuana
Valium - Nicotine - Caffeine - Marijuana


I've walked these streets
A prostitute a priest
A politician a criminal
I've walked these streets
In a carnival
Never quite sure
What I'm looking for


Have I been blind
Have I been lost
Have I been wrong
Have I been hypnotized
Mesmerized
By what my eyes have found
In this great city
What have I been looking for
I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back want you back
Want you back for good

Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back want you back
Want you back for good

Unaware but underlined I figured out this story
It wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me

Whatever I said whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back want you back
Want you back for good

Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back want you back
Want you back for good

And we'll be together this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back want you back
I want you back I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back want you back
Want you back for good

I want you back Whatever I said whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whatever I said whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good I want you back I want you back

Chorus:

Leaving messages time after time

Sh** Puffy the f****** bodysnatcher


I'm livin' everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle another day another struggle
I know it's me against the world it's never me against my girl
Sheeit I try to rock diamonds that twirl and swirl
Gotta stay sucka free avoidin' arressts

Since New York plates was ghetto yellow momma let me play in the street

Don't say my name wrong
BIG keep it strong I'ma finish this song
And another one and another one and another one
Uhhh I'ma getcha you motherf*****s better watch your back
Cause it's the Bodysnatcha
This ain't no disco
And it ain't no country club either this is LA
All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing he says his name's William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars on their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks back to the phone company the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me'cause
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Budweiser crash
He's Xenophobic sarcastic and nasty
He can't be funnier than me
I am quite sure that he'd like to kill me
I'm drinking Sangria in the park
And I don't know why I'm still afraid
I've been here before
Every feeling every word I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Otherwise the bar is ours the day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon but
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Should've seen it coming when the roses died
Should've seen the end of summer in your eyes
Should've listened when you said "Good night"
You really meant "Goodbye"

Baby ain't it funny how you never ever learn to fall
You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are 'know-it-alls' and I played that fool for you

I cried and I cried
There were nights that died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy baby

If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

Baby I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind

Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade ball
Never telling no one nothing at all
We'd whisper in the dark till the morning light
And you'd leave me to dream all alone

I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy baby

If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy baby

If the love that I got for you is gone
If the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
Verse 1:
Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never ever ever gonna let it go

Hook:
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be until you shared
Your secret with me

Chorus:
Mmm

Verse 2:
Something's comin' over mmm
Something's comin' over mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood

Hook:
You knew all long what I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin' anybody else

Chorus:
Mmm

Bridge:
If I can't have you then I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you then I don't want nobody baby

Chorus:

Verse One: Lil' Cease
Nigga please - I fuck with Keys motherfucker
See I'm about to cop a whip just like my uncles
Draped up like a player and armed with the skill
Come check it out the player's anthem
So I could get my mack on get my roll on
And I'll be late for work if you need a ride home
Honey feel me - where your number at
I'll get you with this dope beat
Where the players meet

Chorus: Notorious BIG
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club sipping Moet is where you'll find me
The back of the club mackin' hos my crew's behind me
Mad question askin' blunt passin' music blastin'
But I can't quit cause one guy's daughter is a slut
Big up to all my thugs in the East West North and South

Verse Two: BIG
In the middle of the ghetto doing my thing-o
Flipping chickens and free cocaine Ringo
He introduced me to his red bone that didn't last
Like the season's best so it's back to property sales
I'm fighting for my future damn
I know shit's tight I know it's nice to you
But sometimes you gotta play the game like you choose
Remember there's a million niggas out there just like you
And a hundred grand ain't shit to me
To push a RAV4 to make a hit
These are the games that the players play
And these are the things that the player's fees will pay

Chorus: Notorious BIG
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club sipping Moet is where you'll find me

Mad question askin' blunt passin' music blastin'
But I can't quit cause one guy's daughter is a slut
Big up to all my thugs in the East West North and South

Verse Three: Lil' Kim
I'm living every day like a hustler
Another drug smuggler
Another day another struggle
I'm trying to get it keep it moving make it double
Mama now your son's a baller
I'm going fast with my ass against the wall
Only a fool will fall or even think of the dust
And it's a must that I juke or get juiced
These are the rules players get this lives turned off
Time to shine time to climb
Try to creep a nine to five probably dis my rhymes
Play to hate the game but hate the winners that play
All day homie but I ain't no homo
They keep their girls creamy and their big cars rusty
Player's anthem take you down with us

Chorus: Notorious BIG
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club sipping Moet is where you'll find me
The back of the club mackin' hos my crew's behind me
Mad question askin' blunt passin' music blastin'
But I can't quit cause one guy's daughter is a slut
Big up to all my thugs in the East West North and South

Outro: The Notorious BIG
We'll make ya wop ya head boy with a spat
You know we do it like that whoo
No matter what the people say
We be grinding every day

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Feel Me Flow" by Naughty by Nature:

Intro:
Hey y'all ready to get busy
Verse 1:
Well I lurk in the cut 
In the driver's seat of a burgundy bucket 
I do it N-A-U-G-H-T-Y 
By nature the cause of casualties ah 
I play the cut and then I have to DT 
'Cause everybody wants to see me TCB 
But that's not Sean 
I do the Popa Joe I cut from head to toe 
And then I give a check to my man still pee-oed 
Watch a flavor I'm the new role model 
But slim as a tropic of coca cola 
And if you want some of that real skills 
You gotta know the deal 
I burn you like a third degree 
And leave motherfuckers' brain cells sizzling 
My mystique freaks techniques like a porno flick 
I'm rated X wicked when I perform ho 
I make 'em climax without sex 
And all that next 
Best believe I'm busting rhymes like sex
Chorus:
As I feel the flows that'll make you 
Feel me x4
Verse 2:
I take three MC's put 'em in a spliff 
And smoke 'em real nice slowly 
My persona personifies violence 
Silence I'm about to kill it 
So be quiet or you'll be a gonner 
From New York New York like Frank Sinatra 
I'm heavy like a Chevy I'm a lottery you never win
I'm naughty by nature but not cause of nature 
I'm gettin' slick I'm not a trick 
So don't play me like a sport 
Or you'll be sorry when I let loose with the naughty funk 
And it doesn't quit 
And yup that's me 
The high chief rocker number one 
Never done until the platinum's sold 
Then I add an extra million for the goal 
And then I'm headed for the hills to lounge 
I massage and flex a rap or even a song 
And if it don't fit the topic 
I just knock it out and rock it 
And you'll get with earthquake lip flips 
Back breaks and body shivers 
Everytime a brother gives me love 
I give it right back 
And if you're lackin then you're slacking 
So get back cause I will black 
And I make it rough like sandpaper 
And don't give a damn who the caper 
And if you're one of them dealers 
You can be my hoe and we could go toe-to-toe
Chorus:
As I feel the flows that'll make you 
Feel me x4
Verse 3:
I'm the superior in your posterior 
But I'm prior to better and all the above 
Cause my vocabulary spills over 
And if you're hung up on my goatee 
Then you're getting left in the dust cause I must 
Make my papes and escape from the gates 
Of the pen then count my cash and spend 
And support my seeds with what they need 
Like goldie locks I rock the beats 
And hold the key to succeed third time 
Buckle up as I rock the English language 
Untangling the angles as the vocabulary gets strangled 
I speak in jigsaw and I'm straight up 
I pearl harbor you MC's like I was Japan 
In World War II mode is mode and taking no shorts 
And if you're with a shortcut then you get cut 
Cause I don't bend or blend with the sucker stuff 
And I don't hang with gangs or try to claim 
The hard rhymer the real behind the wheel 
And still I am the grand wizard theodore writing fresh dope lyrics 
Everytime guaranteed to satisfy 
And if not don't let your mouth get your ass in a bind 
Feel me flow
Chorus:
As I feel the flows that'll make you 
Feel me continues until end
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Every Day of the Week" by Jade:

Monday I'm waiting
Tuesday I'm fading
And by Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
'Cause you've come to rescue me
Fall baby into my arms
Come and take this pain away
Fall into my arms
Come on baby don't delay
Tuesday I'm fading
And by Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
'Cause you've come to rescue me
Fall baby into my arms
Come and take this pain away
Fall into my arms
Come on baby don't delay
Oh oh oh
Every day of the week
Every day of the week
Every day of the week
Every day of the week
Fade
Verse 1:
I'm young but I'm wise enough to know
That you don't fall in love overnight
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right

Bridge:
But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love "goodbye"
But I guess I'm only breaking my own heart

Chorus:
For trying to hold back my feelings for so long
For fearing that the love that came on so strong
Is a weakness I'm wrong
I'm just too much in love to let it go now

Verse 2:
Don't be afraid of what people will say
'Cause you're in love you're happy this way
The very thing that makes you happy
Is the same thing that can make you sad

Bridge:
So don't give up on love no no
But don't give in to lies you know
Love can survive under any condition

Chorus:
Don't be afraid to leave the one you love
'Cause behind those tears you'll find another love
I know you're sad and afraid to let it show
But don't let go
Don't give up on the one you love
Don't give up on love

Chorus:
For trying to hold back my feelings for so long
For fearing that the love that came on so strong
Is a weakness I'm wrong
I'm just too much in love to let it go now
Don't be afraid to leave the one you love
'Cause behind those tears you'll find another love
I know you're sad and afraid to let it show
But don't let go don't give up on the one you love
Don't give up on love now
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "You Used to Love Me" by Faith Evans:

I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
When you used to love me
You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours baby
Wanting and needing you
More and more each day
I supply your every need
And I bought about and you just ran away
Now I'm lost in despair
Love and its unfair
Darling I can't find my way
Without you by my side
You were my guide and you know
That I would have satisfied
Forever more baby
I remember
Love me
The way you used to love me
I remember
I remember
The days
The way you used to love me
When you used to love me
Ooh yeah
There's nothing
There's nothing that I won't do
That I won't do for you babe
I'll cry for you
And lie for you
And if in need I'll die for you
Oh ooh
I'm your puppet
On a string
And if you want to
I'll do anything
Ooh baby
There's nothing that I won't do
For you
I once had a love
And it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the @$$
Ooh baby
You don't understand
How good it was
And it ain't no joke
When I think of you
I cry oh baby
Nobody knows
How I feel inside
And I hope you come back to me
I remember the way
There's nothing
That I wouldn't do
Not tomorrow not next week babe
I remember the way
I remember
You used to love me
I remember the way
The way you used to love me
You used to love me
You don't appreciate the time
Appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours baby
And I bought around and you just ran away
I remember the way
I remember
You used to love me
I remember the way
The way you used to love me
Sure I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Constantly" by Immature:

Verse 1:
Lying here baby thinking 'bout 
Your last conversation with me 
It's driving me crazy 
Cause you know it's not I see 
I wanna hold you and kiss you too 
But most importantly I wanna love you

Constantly think of you every day and night

Wanting you more and more all the time 
I guess you could say I'm lost in love

I never felt this way before 
But I'm glad it's me that you adore 
Your love does something to me 
Send shivers down my spine can't you see

I can't seem to get enough

Wanting you more and more all the time

Hoping that you'll sing along

So darling don't you go away 
Cause my love for you grows stronger every day

Constantly think of you every day and night

You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold

All the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night

You say you'll give me
Eyes in a moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest

All the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night

You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold

Your love not to grow cold

All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You all I want is
You all I want is
You all I want is

You all I want is
You all I want is
You all I want is

You all I want is
You all I want is
You all I want is

You all I want is
You all I want is
You all I want is you

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Sugar Hill" by AZ:


Sugar Hill
Yeah yeah


I used to be underrated now I'm
Said to be one of the greats sounds so basic
Chasing that paper it's hard to stay vacant
Focused on cake fuck a statement make it
Hated by many but loved by few
Choice is yours what you wanna do
The game stays fair and the fake gets through
So hats off to whoever made it through shit


Sugar Hill it's the hill that we climb
I'm from the bottom it was grind all the time
Sugar Hill keep chasing the high
Cause money make the world spin and that's no lie


The life we lead is never fair
Walk a mile in mine just be prepared
Nothing comes easy the game ain't square
Think outside of it but don't lose hair
See the forest don't get caught in the trees
If you hesitate somebody might leave
You can learn if you take heed
For those that can't they're going to bleed


Sugar Hill it's the hill that we climb
I'm from the bottom it was grind all the time
Sugar Hill keep chasing the high
Cause money make the world spin and that's no lie


Sugar Hill Sugar Hill
Sugar Hill Sugar Hill

Your violins keep moving to the nitty gritty

When you hear the scratch of the guitars scratchin'
Then you'll know that rhythm carries all the action
Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion

Love to hear it
Flute player play your flute 'cause I know that you flute player
Want to get your thing off
But you see I've made up my mind about it
It's got to be the rhythm no doubt about it

Woohoo When the drummer starts drummin'
He'll give us the cue
To start whooping it up
Like the doo-woppers do

We're gonna get our thing together
We're gonna get our feet apart
Go out and line it up
And we'll be groovin' high or low

Let yourself go

Don't stop for nobody
Nobody
Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion

Love to hear it
Blow horns you sure sound pretty
Your violins keep moving to the nitty gritty

When you hear the scratch of the guitars scratchin'
Then you'll know that rhythm carries all the action
Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion

Love to hear it

Something's wrong I'm not naive but
I believe that you're trying to

Everytime you do what you're doing
You drive me further away

Can't you see that I'm not move

Wake up wake up wake up wake up

And now I'm creepin' on the come up
I'm spinnin' the wheel
Runnin' from the One-Time Jump in the flow
Fill up my 40 to get drunk
I'm takin' 'em swigs
And stuffin' back bones in both pockets tight
And now I'm feelin' so fly
It's the 1st of the month
And all you little punks breakin' the rules
Better go run and hide
The po-po's makin' their rounds
Collectin' they sacks
And they comin' from door to door to see who sells
And who smokes the bud
And I'm just wit my Thugs
And we'll promote and we'll serve
And just like Mama told us
Nigga stay down for yours


Wake up wake up wake up

To get up to get up to get up
So cash your checks and get up


Hey my nigga we havin' a wonderful day
And I won't fuck wit me why
'Cause it's Friday and I just got paid
And ready to get outta my way
On the highway First bar that I hit
Got me a pack of the Zig-Zags
40-ouncein' not dippin' off in the powder
Don't want no punk-ass cops
Givin' me no hassle no hassle
Just tryna play dominoes
And get my drink on and my smoke on
I'm feelin' quite high-like
I'm just a lil' thug never had much
But I'm all right
I'm playin' the cut I'm rollin' it up
I'm lookin' fo' Uncle Charles and 'em
They passin' nothin' but love
A nigga like me I'm pokin' out now
And the world gets love
And somehow I'm singled out
And picked on by the cops oh
But that's just our street life
And we'll overcome that loss


Wake up wake up wake up
It's the first of the month
To get up to get up to get up
So cash your checks and get up


The first of the month
And now I smoke so much cocaine
And runnin' from the po-po'with my big bro Kray
Mo' thugs mo' harmony
And if you don't know now then you're slippin'
And lookin' at things through my rear view
And people they too scared to peruse
I'm claiming my spot at the top
You know what I'm sayin'
And fuck you to all of my enemies enemies
You're clockin' my business nigga
And killin' my senses
And now it's a new day
The sun is up birds singin'
My phone chirpin' it's the Thugs
And my nigga we smokin' get drankin'
Ain't no changin' the street
The top of the month
I'm makin' my moves
And all we so deep Ky-ton and G fool
And Wally and Wish playin' cheek to cheek
And nigga like me I'm in between
St Clair and the Leeds
And when I get on my feet
I rollin' with Ryder and Lil' J
And there you have it on the 1st
It's just another crazy day up on ya'


Wake up wake up wake up
It's the first of the month
To get up to get up to get up
So cash your checks and get up


Wake up wake up wake up wake up
It's the first of the month

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe

He brought disaster wherever he went
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent
They all ran away so nobody would know
And left only men 'cause of Cotton-Eye Joe

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe

He came to town like a midwinter storm
He rode through the fields so handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was having some fun

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe

They say misery loves company
We could start a company and make misery
Frustrated Incorporated
Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see
Put me out of my misery

I'd do it for you would you do it for me
We will always be busy making misery
We could build a factory and make misery
We'll create the cure we made the disease
Frustrated Incorporated Frustrated Incorporated

Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to feel
Put me out of my misery

All you suicide kings and drama queens
Forever after happily making misery
Did you satisfy your greed get what you need
Was it only envy so empty

And no matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true

And do anytime
Oh no but I think you'll find
That when you look inside your heart
Oh baby I'll be there

Baby just come on come on come on

And no matter what you say or do
You know my heart is true oh

Oh I'm twisted and tied
And all I remember
Was how hard we tried
Only to surrender

No not fade away
And I can't stop lovin' you
No matter what I say
And do oh I'm still in love with you

Oh once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies

Yeah humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully
But you why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

Yeah yeah baby well I'll tell you what
I hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I am not amused and neither are my friends
Who by the way are tougher than ten-thousand men
So let's act like we're all interested
And oh by the way I'll need your help
With a thing called moving that you do so well
And you know oh so well I've decided what I'm going to do now

So I'm packing up my bags and I'm heading out
To find another kind of love
Oh babe a stagehand's version of the one I'm thinking of
The kind that makes me feel so second best
Oh baby I didn't mean to say out loud
That I'm so angry I'm so angry I'm so angry
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

Why you wanna give me a run-around
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down
You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life has a spirit has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew


Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle in a hoop that never ends


How high does the sycamore grow
If you cut it down then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind

Let me preface this by saying that the lyrics contain explicit language and mature themes Here are the uncensored lyrics for "You Don't Know How It Feels" by Tom Petty:



Verse 1:
Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me

Chorus:
But let me get to the point let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

Verse 2:
People come people go
Some grow young some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

Chorus:
Let me get to the point let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

Bridge:
My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I got a little space to fill

Chorus:
Let me get to the point let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

Outro:
And if you let me come on home
I'll just let this be I won't tell a soul
No one has to know what's in my head
And if you don't mind I'll just go to bed
Verse 1:
Come and get your love come and get your love
Come and get your love come and get your love

Verse 2:
You know that I love you you know I love you
You know that I love you and I'll always be true

Chorus:
So come and get your love come and get your love
Come and get your love come and get your love

Verse 3:
This is what dreams are made of this is what dreams are made of
This is what dreams are made of so come and take a ride with me

Chorus:

Come and get your love come and get your love

Bridge:
You know that I want you you know I need you
You know that I love you and I'll never leave you

Chorus:
So come and get your love come and get your love
Come and get your love come and get your love

Outro:
Come and get your love come and get your love
Come and get your love come and get your love

We'll discover
Baby that there's a paradise
And we'll survive 
As long as we keep our love alive


The sweetest days are the first to go
The hardest nights are the ones you know
When you feel lonely 'cause it's only
The first time for you and me


We'll get through it
Just don't give up on me
Two drifters
Off to see the world 
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasing our ends 
And we climb every mountain higher and higher


The sweetest days are the first to go
The hardest nights are the ones you know
When you feel lonely 
Because it's only
The first time for you and me


We'll find direction
And we'll make our own connections
And we'll overcome our fears and soon
We'll find our sweetest days


The sweetest days are the first to go
The hardest nights are the ones you know
When you feel lonely
'Cause it's only
The first time for you and me


The sweetest days are the first to go
The hardest nights are the ones you know
When you feel lonely
'Cause it's only
The first time for you and me

I used to be lunatic from the gracious days
I used to be woebegone and so restless nights
My aching heart would bleed for you to see
Oh but now


I don't find myself bouncing home whistling
Buttonhole tunes to make me cry
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the words


The lover speaks about the monsters that have come with nightmares at the start
Beauty no longer intoxicates me
You're a beautiful baritone
But I'm immune
You don't exist
In isolation
The world is stone


Be still
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence


No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the words
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me


No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence
Verse 1:
I said "baby can I have this"
"You said "baby can't you see"
"I'm busy right now leave a message and I'll call you back"
I said "baby I'm feeling real down"
"You said "don't you worry
I'm coming around gonna show you what I'm made of"

Chorus:
Oh I love you like the way I love my freedom
I'll take you places that you've never been
And I'll give you all you need
Oh I love you like the way I love my freedom
I'll give you everything you need
If you want love then baby here it is

Verse 2:
I said "baby I'm going out"
You said "baby don't you forget
You're mine mine all mine and I'll never let you go"
I said "baby I'm feeling real high"
You said "don't you worry
I'm coming down gonna show you what I know"

Chorus

Bridge:
Oh it's just like love
Oh it's just like love
Oh it's just like love
Oh it's just like love

Chorus

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Big Poppa" and "Warning" by The Notorious BIG:

"Big Poppa"

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace  
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes  
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies  
The back of the club sippin' Moet is where you'll find me  
The back of the club mackin' hoes my crew's behind me  
Mad question askin' blunt passin' music blastin'  
But I just can't quit because one of these honeys Biggie gots ta creep with  
Sleep with keep the ep a secret why not  
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot  
Now check it I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed  
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy  
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's  
See no more makin' ends meet no more makin' hits  
Mad question askin' blunt passin' music blastin'  
But I just can't quit because one of these honeys Biggie gots ta creep with  
Sleep with keep the ep a secret why not  
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot  
Check it I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed  
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy  
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's  
See no more makin' ends meet no more makin' hits  

"Warning"  

Who the hell is this emailin' me at 11:26  
Telling me that she 36-26 plus double d's  
You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly  
At NYU but she hail from Kansas  
Right now let's just call her Bussa  
Had to stop at Red lights looking in my mirror  
Not a jacker in sight now I gotcha  
Sippin' on some Cristal we screamin' Thug life  
Every time they see us we hug tight  
Neck full of gold wit' rocks to match  
Fillin' voids of pockets that others dream they stacks  
Got cock I bust that heaven forbid  
If the dick stop then I'mma lean probably hit the block  
As much weed as I smoke police think I'm selling rocks  
Yo dick itty bitty the rubber too biggie  
A bulletproof vest is don everyday of the week  
I'm used to repo'in' trucks now I repo' em in jeeps 
People too scared to ask "Did you sleep"  
It's all good  
Uh  
I'm livin' every day like a hustle  
Another drug to juggle  
Another day another struggle  
Gotta chip my Pirellis just to get by  
It's all about the dough ladies never seen me but they lovin' me  
Benzes Jeeps and Fendi be the things that I runnin' be   
Money makes a man strange  
I hit the block and maintain  
Gettin' back what I paid for  
And y'all could call it what you want  
But I'ma call it hustlin' backwards  
I smoke Newports  
I drink quarter waters  
My piss is off color  
I talk like I slaughter  
And If I order something to eat  
I order lobster  
If I got beef with a nigga  
I don't just squash it  
I swing razor blades mini machetis  
Chop off his legs  
Leave him standing in his socks  
If he's lucky  
Don't ask me why I'm so motherfuckin' lyrical  
These jackers want dope  
and I'm supplyin' that miracle  
I'm living on the low getting high on the regular  
Sippin' on Cristal  
and I'm draped in Adidas  
Got a girl in every borough  
and they all packed Glocks  
Sellin' that chocolate to heroes  
Mo money mo problems  
But fuck it we ballin'  
Now that I'm living so well  
I might as well get in heaven  
The show must go on  
The show must go on
Verse 1: 
All I want is a man who's got a big 
I want somebody who can hold the test of time 
I want somebody who can make me feel fine 
I want somebody who can be all mine 
I want somebody who's got a big fat 

Chorus: 
Short dick man 
Don't want don't want don't want don't want a short dick man 
Don't want don't want don't want don't want a short dick man 

Verse 2: 
All I want is a man who's got the size 
I wanna feel it when I look into his eyes 
I wanna be the one who gets the big surprise 
I wanna feel it don't compromise 
I wanna man who's got a big fat 

Chorus 

Rap: 
It's time to stop for a moment and analyze the system 
Democracy's gone which way we gonna go 
We gotta work together or we'll lose it you know 
We're all people we're all human 
Let's stick together big and small 
Gotta keep up gotta progress 
Don't regroup just express yourself 
Stand proud don't deny exhibit how you feel 
You gotta let your body words flow like a steel 
Stampede the dance floor let's get raw 
Ain't no room for misunderstanding 
So if you're short or if you're tall 
Just dance don't quit best believe in yourself 

Chorus 

Verse 3: 
All I want is a man who's got the length 
I ain't doin' it with no microscopic strength 
Don't wanna crawl when he's got me up in his range 
Don't wanna have to make love in ways that'll seem so strange 
I want a
