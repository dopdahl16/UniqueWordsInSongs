Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now

Woah woah
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh baby I need you now
Hey hey hey  
Your lipstick stains  
On the front lobe of my  
Left side brains  
I knew I wouldn't forget you  
And so I went and let you  
Blow my mind  
Your sweet moonbeam  
The smell of you in every single dream I dream  
I knew when we collided  
You're the one I have decided  
Who's one of my kind  
Hey soul sister ain't that Mr Mister  
On the radio stereo  
The way you move ain't fair you know  
Hey soul sister I don't want to miss  
A single thing you do tonight  
Hey hey hey  
Just in time I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me  
You gave my life direction  
A game show love connection we can't deny  
I'm so obsessed  
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest  
I believe in you  
Like a virgin you're Madonna  
And I'm always gonna want to blow your mind  
Hey soul sister ain't that Mr Mister  
On the radio stereo  
The way you move ain't fair you know  
Hey soul sister I don't want to miss  
A single thing you do tonight  
The way you can cut a rug  
Watching you's the only drug I need  
You're so gangsta I'm so thug  
You're the only one I'm dreaming of  
You see I can be myself now finally  
In fact there's nothing I can't be  
I want the world to see you'll be with me  
Hey soul sister ain't that Mr Mister  
On the radio stereo  
The way you move ain't fair you know  
Hey soul sister I don't want to miss  
A single thing you do tonight  
Hey soul sister I don't want to miss  
A single thing you do tonight  
Hey hey hey  
Tonight  
Hey hey hey  
Oh my gosh
Baby let me

You make me want to say: Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

And I can't take no more

For one oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Alright here are the uncensored lyrics of "Break Your Heart" by Taio Cruz featuring Ludacris:


Luda Tonight I'm gonna do
Everything that I want with you
Everythin' that u need
Everything u want I wanna honey
I wanna stunt with you
From the window
To the wall
Gonna give u my all
Winter n summertime
When I get you on the springs
I'mma make you fall
You got that body
That make me wanna get on the boat
Just to see you dance
And I love the way you shake that ass
Turn around and let me see them pants
You stuck with me
I'mma keep it lowkey
Got my head on tight
I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
Let's go


There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put on a show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat gotta be first
I'm like a ringleader I call the shots
Call the shots
I'm like a firecracker I make it hot
When I put on a show


I break your heart
And I get away with murder
woo woo woo
I break your heart
And you could be under my covers
woo woo woo
I break your heart
And I get away with murder
woo woo woo
I break your heart
And you could be under my covers
woo woo woo


Showtime here I go
Curtain's up my time to show
I'm like a superstar got unlimited funds
So let's get drunk on champagne bubbles
I'll be your teacher I'll show you the ropes
You'll see a side of me you won't get to know
I put on a show


I break your heart
And I get away with murder
woo woo woo
I break your heart
And you could be under my covers
woo woo woo
I break your heart
And I get away with murder
woo woo woo
I break your heart
And you could be under my covers
woo woo woo


Heartbreaker you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart


I break your heart
And I get away with murder
woo woo woo
I break your heart
And you could be under my covers
I break your heart
And I get away with murder
woo woo woo
I break your heart
And you could be under my covers
woo woo woo
Beautiful girls all over the world

I could be chasing but my time would be wasted

They got nothin' on you baby

Nothin' on you baby

They might say hi and I might say hey

But you shouldn't worry about what they say

'Cause they got nothin' on you baby

Nothin' on you baby

Not-not-nothin' on you babe

Not-not-nothin' on you

I know you feel where I'm coming from

Regardless of the things in my past that I've done

Most of it really was for the hell of the fun

On a carousel so around I spun

With no directions just tryna get some

Tryna chase skirts living in the summer sun

And so I lost more than I had ever won

And honestly I ended up with none

It's so much nonsense it's on my conscience

I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"

And I don't wanna sound redundant

But I was wondering if there was something that you wanna know

But never mind that we should let it go

'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode

And all the bad thoughts just let 'em go go go

Beautiful girls all over the world

I could be chasing but my time would be wasted

They got nothin' on you baby

Nothin' on you baby

They might say hi and I might say hey

But you shouldn't worry about what they say

'Cause they got nothin' on you baby

Nothin' on you baby

Not-not-nothin' on you babe

Not-not-nothin' on you

Hands down there will never be another one nope

I've been around and I've never seen another one never

Because your style I 'aint really got nothin' on nothing

And I 'aint got nothin' for a ring back

Will I cut A player off nope

Kryptonite You got that yeah

Put it on my world I will spin it back spinning

Pizza boy's got our delivery man

Beautiful girls all over the world

I could be chasing but my time would be wasted

They got nothin' on you baby

Nothin' on you baby

They might say hi and I might say hey

But you shouldn't worry about what they say

'Cause they got nothin' on you baby

Nothin' on you baby

Not-not-nothin' on you babe

Not-not-nothin' on you

Yeah

You think I'm pretty without any make-up on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me so I let my walls come down down

Before you met me I was alright
But things were kinda heavy you brought me to life
Now every February you'll be my Valentine Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets just love
We can dance until we die
You and I we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream the way you turn me on
I can't sleep let's run away and
Don't ever look back don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch now baby I believe
This is real so take a chance and
Don't ever look back don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets just love
We can dance until we die
You and I we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream the way you turn me on
I can't sleep let's run away and
Don't ever look back don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch now baby I believe
This is real so take a chance and
Don't ever look back don't ever look back

I might get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream the way you turn me on
I can't sleep let's run away and
Don't ever look back don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch now baby I believe
This is real so take a chance and
Don't ever look back don't ever look back

I might get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Ohhh

Oh her eyes her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say

When I see your face face face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing amazing
Just the way you are are

And when you smile smile smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing amazing
Just the way you are are
The way you are the way you are
Girl you're amazing amazing
Just the way you are are
The way you are the way you are
Girl you're amazing amazing
Just the way you are are

Yeah yeah

Her lips her lips
I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know you know you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face face face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing amazing
Just the way you are are

And when you smile smile smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing amazing
Just the way you are are
The way you are the way you are
Girl you're amazing amazing
Just the way you are are
The way you are the way you are
Girl you're amazing amazing
Just the way you are are

Afrika Bambaataa shit home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab gypsy cab dollar cab holla back

Eight million stories out there and they're naked
Cities is a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me I gotta plug Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jesus paying LeBron I'm paying Dwyane Wade
Three dice Cee-lo three-card Monte
Labor Day Parade rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty long live the World Trade
Long live the king yo I'm from the Empire State
Home of the hip-hop yellow cab gypsy cab dollar cab holla back
For the streets of Lagos out there off of the curb
For the ghetto children blood of the veldt

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy featuring Bruno Mars:


I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen


Oh every time I close my eyes What you see what you see
I see my name in shining lights Uh-huh uh-huh
A different city every night oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire


I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad So bad
Buy all of the things I never had Uh-huh uh-huh
Uh I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights yeah a different city every night oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire


Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like "Here lady have this"
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it hehe I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music


I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights yeah a different city every night oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire


Oh ooh oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire
I'll be playing basketball with the President


Dunking on his delegates then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives twenties tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatevers left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing


I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad So bad
Buy all of the things I never had Uh-huh uh-huh
Uh I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights yeah a different city every night oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Yeah it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doing this for me so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album
He's still shittin' and whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first for better or worse
He's married to the game like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse forget the Earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up Imma face my demons
I'm manning up Imma hold my ground
I've had enough now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally
For you so I could come back a brand new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did believe me you
I've been through the ringer but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead no more beef flingers
No more drama from now on I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it you couldn't lift a single shingle on it

Cause the way I feel I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars I feel amazing
And I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayed to a God that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

Her best days will be some of my worst
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even even no

What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay
I'm falling to pieces yeah
I'm falling to pieces
They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving
And when a heart breaks no it don't break even even no

And what am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay
I'm falling to pieces yeah
I'm falling to pieces yeah
I'm falling to pieces
One still in love while the other one's leaving
I'm falling to pieces
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase I took the blame
Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains ooh
'Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just prayed to a God that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break
No it don't break no it don't break even no

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave tear drops everywhere
You'd think me rude
But I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread thread thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems when I fall asleep

Leave my door open just a crack
Please take me away from here
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Please take me away from here
Why do I tire of counting sheep
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
Ha-ha

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell said farewell

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar jar jar

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems when I fall asleep

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

So why don’t we run away

Verse 2:
I’ll make you hot like fire
I’ll take you higher
Let’s light up the night
And let it burn
We’re going down down down
Down down

Bridge:
Girl you know we got it right here between us
And I’mma drop it like it’s hot
And show you how we do this
The way you move your body
And everything you do
Makes me wanna get with you
Girl you got me hypnotized
With the way you roll those eyes
Girl I got my hand on your hips
And pull you right back to me
I’ll take you to the edge
And make you lose your head
And it’ll be okay
’Cause tonight we’re gonna get it all done

Chorus:
So leave it behind ‘cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape
So why don’t we run away

Been there done that messed around
I'm having fun don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I tried to send
My information it's just not going in
I'm burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it’s cheap


Been there done that messed around
I'm having fun don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
This time baby I'll be
Bulletproof


I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do do do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt
There's certain things that should be
Left unsaid
Tick tick tick tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh baby your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt


Been there done that messed around
I'm having fun don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
This time baby I'll be
Bulletproof Bulletproof bulletproof
This time baby I'll be
Bulletproof Bulletproof bulletproof

Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh whoa
You know you love me I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You are my love you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item Girl quit playin'

Said there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

And I was like


Baby baby baby ooh
Like baby baby baby noo
Like baby baby baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine mine


Oh for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down down down down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like


Baby baby baby ooh
Like baby baby baby noo
Like baby baby baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine mine


Luda when I was 13 I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us no one could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy oh I was starstruck
She woke me up daily don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound I skip a beat when I see her in the street
And at school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazin' 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin' but I just keep on sayin'

Verse 1:
I can see you starin' honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second third and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breakin' branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

Pre-Chorus:
I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Chorus:
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose kiss I could recognize anywhere

Verse 2:
There's a iron on his shirt
And a crease in his pants
His rehearsals' been delayed
Again
But you know his aim is gettin' better
And he's been sendin' all his best lines

Pre-Chorus:
So say hello to the girl that I am
Hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna see her everywhere
You're gonna see her everywhere

Chorus:
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose kiss I could recognize anywhere

Bridge:
They don't tell you when you're young
You'll feel this way
When you meet the one
And I'd apologize
But I don't hate you
'Cause honey I'm still in love
I'm still in love

Chorus:
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose kiss I could recognize anywhere
Sometimes we fall down and can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough
Till it's too late it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you what would you wish you would've done

Yeah gotta start
Lookin' at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got and we gotta start thinkin'
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying oh

We only have the sun we only have today
And before they turn the lights out let's shine a light and give it all we got
It's now or never 'cause you ain't livin'
Forever gotta live like we're dying yeah

We gotta start looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got and we gotta start thinkin'
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying

Like we're dying oh
Like we're dying oh
Like we're dying

Ayy can't fuck with the queen
Can't fuck with the queen hey

Verse 1: Jay-Z
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
Cuz there is no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that lasts a whole lifetime
And it never ends
Because all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment smoke some weed drink some wine
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Hey hey

It all comes back to me baby
It was like 3 AM
In disregard of everything I did
You were deep in my head
When I'd make my move you would innocently move
I remember you'd say
Wanna dance Can I take your hand
Get lost in the trance boy let's take a chance boy
I don't want this night to end
Do you remember do you remember
When we first met
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Da de ya de ya de ya
De ya
How could I forget baby
What we had was everything
We were young and dumb but we were
Built to be something still I'm thinking 'bout
All the things we used to do
I remember you'd say
Wanna dance Can I take your hand
Get lost in the trance boy let's take a chance boy
I don't want this night to end
Do you remember do you remember
When we first met
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Da de ya de ya de ya
De ya
Those times together
They couldn't last forever
But I'm thankful for the memories
And all the happiness that you brought to me look back at it
If I could I'd match it
Our love was fantastic
Bold but it was classic
Ooh I remember Do you remember
Do you remember do you remember
When we first met
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Ba de ya de ya de ya
Da de ya de ya de ya
De ya

All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah we're going down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah we're going down


Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They've got it better than when anyone's told ya
They'll be the King of Hearts and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers
I know we've got it good but they got it made
And the grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name
They've got all the right friends in all the right places
So yeah we're going down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah we're going down


They say everybody knows everybody knows where we're going
Yeah we're going down
They say everybody knows everybody knows where we're going
Yeah we're going down


Do you think I'm special Do you think I'm nice
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces
Between the noise you hear and the sound you like
Are we just sinking in an ocean of faces
It can't be possible the rain can fall only when it's over our heads
The sun shines only when it's cold outside
It's always darkest before the light
And they say that before you go up you gotta learn how to fall
But the hardest part is always that kind of blind resolve


They say everybody knows everybody knows where we're going
Yeah we're going down
They say everybody knows everybody knows where we're going
Yeah we're going down
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah we're going down
All the right moves in all the right faces
So yeah we're going down


Would you appreciate the same things
Or would it be something new
Had you worked for your attention
Would you still feel understood
All the right friends in all the right places
Would you be lost if they let you go
All the right moves in all the right faces
And all these things that I've done
Would they be half as much fun


They say everybody knows everybody knows where we're going
Yeah we're going down
They say everybody knows everybody knows where we're going
Yeah we're going down
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah we're going down
All the right moves in all the right faces
So yeah we're going down

And she step out in public and you thinkin' she a celebrity truth

BB be the best you're denied it
But the proof is in the pudding and the pudding's where you find it
Got a back-end bigger than the front
Swaggin' bigger than the shunt
And a face that make ya stop clock rewind it
See my sex game stupid my head is the dumbest
I promise I should be hooked on phonics
And by the way I am not bionic
And I ain't tryna' tone it down for no one
See I am the best yes I am the champion
And you're a novice I'm LeBron James
And you're a Brian Scalabrine
See I'm the H-O-V of this game
Your career's LeBron's jersey in twenty years game
You're on the phone with your girlfriend she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me you belong with me
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine I know you better than that
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
She wears high heels I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me
Oh I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

Ooh I can't go any further than this
Ooh I want you so badly it's my biggest wish


Cool I spend my time just thinkin' thinkin' thinkin' 'bout you
Every single day yes I'm really missin' missin' you
And all those things we used to used to used to used to do
Hey girl what's up it used to used to be just me and you

Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Animal" by Neon Trees:

Here we go again I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Is it just a game to you let's be honest we can make it if we try
So let me give it to you yeah

I wanna know what you're thinking
There's some things you can't hide
I wanna know what you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

I'm sorry animal animal
I oh let you down
It's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it

Oh no oh no oh no

Here we go again another drink I'm caving in
But I know it's too late I feel it deep in my chest
Tell me what can I do can I make it up to you
Can I try a little harder to show you what you're worth

I wanna know what you're thinking
There's some things you can't hide
I wanna know what you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

I'm sorry animal animal

So scared of breaking it
But you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters

Sometimes these cuts are so much
Deeper then they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them bleed


So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in
Misery

Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah oh yeah
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back


Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
It's not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel
It's what I didn't show


So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in
Misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me
Your silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah oh yeah
Girl you really got me bad

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess whoa
Am I gonna fit in

Jumped in the cab
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
I got my hands up they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah it's a party in the USA
Yeah it's a party in the USA

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks
She's gotta be from out of town"

So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
I got my hands up they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah it's a party in the USA
Yeah it's a party in the USA

Feel like hoppin' on a flight on a flight
Back to my hometown tonight town tonight
Something stops me every time every time
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

So I put my hands up they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
I got my hands up they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah it's a party in the USA
So I put my hands up they're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
I got my hands up they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah it's a party in the USA
Yeah it's a party in the USA
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl yeah
Who knows just what I need she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama-free
I'll be damned if I let another chick bring me down
Think it's time for me to take a bow bow
So take a bow bow
Oh it's over baby it's over baby
I'm leaving I'm gone
I can't stay here no more
And I'll be damned if I ever come back whoa
Said it's over baby it's over baby
I'm leaving I'm gone
I can't stay here no more
And I'll be damned if I ever come back96315
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion my mistake
I was careless I forgot
I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof top
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible impossible
Impossible impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof top
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible impossible
Impossible impossible

Ooh impossible yeah yeah
Ooh impossible yeah yeah

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof top
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible impossible
Impossible impossible

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
Understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mane ever mane ever mane


Last name ever first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first-name basis
And your city faded off to brown Nino
She insists she got more class we know
Swimmin' in the money come and find me—Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball chemo
Dropped a mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd'a thought a country-wide tour'd be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal I did it without one yeah
Nigga I'm about my business killin' all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness bitches


I'm the opposite of moderate immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit impartial to the politics
Articulate but still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with me probably got a problem with the pick
They'll try to swallow their pride you're lucky just to follow my kicks
Bitch I'm ballin' like I'm comin' off of free throws
Just real estate you niggas buildin' like Amazon
Yeah I know some bitch named Ariana a real cunt
Got a man but he ain't got you he be dissin' on you
I done got hotter she done got colder
My dope come straight off the boat so
I'm on a boat like T-Pain but niggas gettin' seasick
I'm in the lab no pad no pencils just revenge
Shootin' at the future with my pistols like "vendetta"
Yeah ain't nothin' sweeter I'm tongue kissin' my money
She say "Keep on writin'—you're so pretty" and I'm like "Fool you know how much I'm worth I'm a millionaire bitch"


Fuck a deal I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I suck as a rapper
Suck his penis I'm a climber you're a window I'm a sniper
You're just a reminder you're a tailor I'm a fighter
You're the warden I'm the prisoner I'm a rioter you're a writer
You're a vagina I'm the dick that fucked ya—wipe ya
I'll launch ya come and pick you up
Kick a dust up I don't kick the cup I'm fuckin' it up
I'm diggin' it now my signal's dull I'm a graze
I'm blatant and out you're a mute slut let me give you the outline
Of what I'm about the fifth killer I cut off the lights
Kill the engine and silence the chainsaw
Trimmed the weed wacker imagine goin' to get ya chainsaw
Feelin' like you got ya neck restrained off
Chain so mad at ya face that you just took ya chains off
Is that what you came for Oh the fuckin' demon is here to stay caught
This ain't Dexter this is Bryan Cranston as an insane storm
Like fuckin' Walter White on the edge with a sniper rifle
That's aimed at my forehead prayin' that I don't shoot it
Christ two fisted and knife this wife killin' her off at highness
Got more sole than a shoestore fuck with me and I'll go to war
Like a bout to blow soldiers at a do' came to blow ya blow
Sniff a lil coke hit the backstroke in a nitro boat
Fuck that I'm a roof Chris Reeves
Sonic the Hedgehog jumpin' jimminy pogo-stick galoshes verse is over

However I can provide the original lyrics of "Two Is Better Than One" by Boys Like Girls featuring Taylor Swift which are already widely available online Here they are without any additional commentary or information:

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought hey
You know this could be something

'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true
That I can't live without you

Well maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing

'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
And finally now believing

That maybe it's true
That I can't live without you

Well maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

Yeah yeah

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought hey

Maybe it's true
That I can't live without you

Maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking

Ooh I can't live without you 'cause baby
Two is better than one
There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
Two is better than one
Two is better than one
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wooh
Let's go

Music
My first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

I said
No more teachers and no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers
Hoping that nobody looks
Lips like licorice tongue like candy
Excuse me ma'am but I ain't no eye-candy
Been looking for love in all the wrong places
Now I'm kissing and tryna erase it
Pulled up bumper sticker that said "I hate us"
Grabbed your hand we fell into it like a daydream
Or a fever a complete hallucination
But I ain't ever seen nothing that'll make me go

This crazy all night spending my dough
Had a milli' dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Got my drink on and I feel like dancing
Dancing

Chorus
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do

'Cause

Verse 2
When I - step up in the club
There's nobody that I can't get to hop
These kids are lining up like they're in the front
And they wanna get in and they wanna get
A little of this

Girl on girl that's the way to go
I'll back you up yeah cause that's what I'm good at
We've got thirty minutes to get back to the hotel
Before your daddy gets back
And I don't want to cause a scene
Like a prince you can have your dreams
But baby if you're dreaming of me
We'll face the end of the world together

Chorus
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do

Outro
My first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high


It never would have worked out right yeah
We were never meant for do or die mmh
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hold you now


I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There's so much space between us
Maybe we're already gone
Already gone already gone
Already gone already gone


Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high


It never would have worked out right yeah
We were never meant for do or die mmh
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you now


I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There's so much space between us
Maybe we're already gone
Already gone already gone
Already gone already gone


We tried so hard to understand
But we held it in our hands
We ran as far as we could run
But that was all just for fun


I can't love you in the dark Can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart We're oceans apart
There's so much space between us
Maybe we're already gone Already gone
I can't love you in the dark Can't love you in
It feels like we're oceans apart Woo
There's so much space between us
Maybe we're already gone


Already gone
Already gone
Maybe we're already gone

I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess

'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink no
I've been on the brink so


Tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away


My God amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And everyday I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album


Tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away


Oh got no reason got no shame
Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear
I'mma tell you everything


So tell me what you want to hear
Something that'll light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
All my secrets away all my secrets away

Hey yeah


All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there and they say "yeah"
And they stay there up down up down up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make 'em stay there


Luda
I'm on a roll and I'm hilarious
'Cause I'm flying like an ostrich bow my head and keep climbing
Here we go again fastest and the furious
Now pay attention let me state my business
I'm a grown-ass man with a hell of a plan
Always thinking about my next million
In my hands and I'm married to the game
But we don't need no prenuptial agreement
And every time I'm in they gotta go
And then they go and scream "Luda" Hey


All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there and they say "yeah"
And they stay there up down up down up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make 'em stay there


Oh Snoop Dogg I'm high as a'ight I'm rolling down the street
I make them stay back motherfucker bow down to me
Yes sir I wear the crown 'bout to go down
I'm a legend in the game if you ain't heard about my name
The west coast king motherfucker I'll be
Ridin' through the storm like Hurricane Katrina
With a platinum voice man it's just a minor irritation
I'mma keep doing me I fuck with the nation
And everyday it's celebrate no need for rehabilitation


I never went nowhere
But they sayin' Luda's back
Blame it on that conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track
So I spit my foolish flows
My hands go up and down
Like strippers' booties go
My verses still be servin' tat's right
Like a pack of of unk
Left right left right
And we gon' run this sack
If they do any more
I'll just meet them north
And we'll shut it down down down


All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there and they say "yeah"
And they stay there up down up down up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make 'em stay there


Heat in the kitchen pot on the stove
Water gettin' boiled dope bein' sold
Snoopy in the hoopty system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of them
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up toss 'em up Hardaway boss 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up
Pressure up bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the U in the 80s
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick hit it back
Hit the trick jump the track
Bitch I want my money back
Time and time again
While I'm sippin' on this gin
Al Davis said it best just win baby win
Yeah Cash Money heroes
Private jets
Polish fly
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it I made it
I used to dream about the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it
I made it

Map of the World
Oh yeah ah huh
I used to dream
Oversleep
The water's warm the beach is yours
I used to play with sandcastles uh huh
Now I'm on the beach
Watchin' all the candles
The beach pharaoh cut always in a second
I'm been the sun for years Tim's peeping through the other end
Birdman Junior in this bitch no flamingos
And I done did everythang but trust these hoes

When they shootin' I'm in the gym
Aww man I just can't lose
And when you goin' hard someone always gonna hate you
Can't worry 'bout that never really worried 'bout that
Nah I'm just young moneyin' live life bluntly
It's just me and my team we gettin' money boloney

Yeah Cash Money heroes
Private jets
Polish fly
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it I made it
I used to dream about the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it
I made it

The rock
I'm faded I'm like a few days old
But I'm crowned the king of New Orleans
And besides that I'm known throughout the world
‘Cause I'm the guy who owns the locker room
And the locker room is where I found my throne
Only two people to crown me
Now there's a million people goin' crazy
The only question now is how do I maintain

Yeah Cash Money heroes
Private jets
Polish fly
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it I made it
I used to dream about the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it
I made it
Absolutely here are the uncensored lyrics for "Stuck Like Glue" by Sugarland:

Mmmm better
MMMMM Hmmmm

Mmmm


Absolutely no one that knows me better
No one that can make me feel sooo goooood
How did we stay so long together
When everybody everybody said we never would


And just when I I start to think they're right
That love has died


There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again
Heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in
Right back in
And I know
I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you
Whoooooa Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Whooooa stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue


Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right
Fight about it all night


And right before we get to the brink
Of throwing it all away
We both wake up and we both say…


wwooohoooo There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again
Heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in
Right back in
And I know
I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you Stuck like glue
Whoooooa Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Whooooa stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue


And just when I I start to think they're right
That love has died
There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again
Heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in
Right back in
And I know
I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you
Whoooooa Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Whooooa stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue Stuck like glue
Whooooa Stuck like glue Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue Stuck like glue
Whooooa stuck like glue Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue Stuck like glue

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand
And you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale

I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is
Wow wow
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Gettin' louder Hey yeah Hey
Gettin' louder



Look baby girl you're so damn fine though
I'm tryna know if I could hit it from behind though
I'm sippin' on you like some fine wine though
And when it's over I press rewind though ayy

You talkin' bands girl I got it
Benjamins in my pocket
I traded in my trues for some Robins
He playin' Batman Fetty's gon' rob him ayy

I got a Glock in my 'rari ayy
17 shots no 38
I got a Glock in my 'rari ayy
17 shots no 38



Yeah I'ma tell him like this man
I'ma tell him like this man
Better know yourself before you go and try to know me ay
Woah I'ma tell you like this man
I'ma tell you like this



Only if you're lonely
That's when you should phone me
But we don't have no ties
So I'ma need a "Go 'head stone me"
Boy you got me hopin'
Damn I'm smokin' feelin' weak
And I can't control it
You got me open don't wanna close it

I got a couple of girls that could rep for me
Putting on a show so they could yell for me
Standing at the front row
Kickin' up a storm but no I never tell 'em to storm for me
I ain't gotta check the forecast for me
I just make the call and get the shit delivered to me
And I'm the f*ckin' man I'm feelin' like the difference


Yeah I'ma tell him like this man
I'ma tell him like this man
Better know yourself before you go and try to know me ay
Woah I'ma tell you like this man
I'ma tell you like this



Gettin' louder
Gettin' louder
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I've traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I've traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'

Hold your head up
Keep your head up movin' on
Hold your head up movin' on
Keep your head up movin' on
Hold your head up movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Yeah now I'm right above it hey
Girls all on my mind like replays
Gotta start from the bottom to the top huh
"Underdog just turned into the wolf huh"
But where were you when I was still a dog huh
And I'm still a dog huh but I'm just a wolf now
I guess it's safe to say you're playin' yourself if you're hatin' on me
But hey it's all love lately
Yeah it's crazy like I'm out of control but damn it's been fun
I'm fully focused my mind on my money
Got a new condo watch a Sunset every day
Damn I'm so high it's like I'm up in the sky
And I'm never going down never goin' down
And it's evident that I'm hot homie and I'm flyin'
And I'm goin' to the top flyin' to the top
And I'm gonna stay there better believe it
And I'm gonna stay there better believe it
And I'm gonna stay there better believe it
And I'm gonna stay there yeah yeah yeah
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it

And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now
I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth
The risk

Well you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning
When you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
Oh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh and I'm on my way to believing
Keep drinkin' coffee stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions man we're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked
So let me thank you for your time and try not to waste anymore of mine
And get out of here fast

I hate to break it to you babe but I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree You are not me
Who made you king of anything
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything

All my life I've tried to make everybody happy
While I just hurt and hide
Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide
Who cares if you disagree You are not me
Who made you king of anything
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything

Oh who cares if you disagree You are not me
Who made you king of anything
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything

Let me hold your crown babe
Verse 1:
Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong but you already know
Believe me I won't stop at nothing

Verse 2:
Ten miles from town and I just hit the ground
Tell everybody I'm sorry I'm sorry bout' the pain that I caused
I'm lookin' for a way to make it somehow
By the grace of God I do not rest at all
Believe me I won't stop at nothing

Bridge:
I'm ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight
Song is through I'm leaving you with words to last a lifetime
It's not easy to be me

Outro:
Wish that I could cry fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie 'bout a home I'll never see
It may sound absurd but don't be naive
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed but won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
It's not easy to be me

Ayy Ayy

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey


I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees undone
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek at us


You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love ooh oh ooh oh

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Ooh oh ooh
Ooh oh ooh


Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo oh oh


You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love ooh oh ooh oh

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Ooh oh ooh
Ooh oh ooh


Toned tan fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's getting heavy
Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones I mean like she's the one
Kiss her touch her squeeze her buns


The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach
I'm okay I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love LA
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis zucchinis martinis no weenies
Just a king and a queenie
Katy my lady yeah
Lookie here baby


I'm all up on you
'Cause you representin' California oh yeah
I'm feeling like gold gold
I'm outta control
With all this sweet sweet honey all-around
I'mma let one more round
Move it in
Bump it up
Let's take this town
We're gonna dance until the world ends
Ooh oh ooh
Ooh oh ooh
Can do Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Airplanes" by BoB featuring Hayley Williams:


Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now


Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glamour and fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance


So airplanes airplanes
Sorry I'm late I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night


Yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But now a days we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur what's up Bobby Ray


So airplanes airplanes
Sorry I'm late I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night


Yeah yeah
And it seems like yesterday
It was just a dream
But those days are gone gone gone gone by
Where did they go


So airplanes airplanes
Sorry I'm late I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night


Yeah yeah
Ooh-ooh
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love it the more that I suffer I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it wait
Where you going I'm leaving you No you ain't come back
We're running right back Here we go again
It's so insane cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful I feel so ashamed I snap
Who's that dude I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em so lost in the moments when you're with 'em
It's the fate that took over it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over but you promised her
Next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie


Now I know we said things did things that we didn't mean
But your temper's just as bad as mine is you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded baby please come back
It wasn't you baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know its lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'ma tie her to the bed
And set the house on fire


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love  
I would already have you up under my arm  
I used up all of my tricks I hope that you like this  
But you probably won't you think you're cooler than me  
You got designer shades just to hide your face  
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me  
And you never say hey or remember my name  
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me  
You got your high brow shoes on your feet  
And you wear them around like it ain't sh\*t  
But you don't know the way that you look when your steps  
Make that much noise  
See I got you all figured out  
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen  
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are  
Who do you think that you are  
Ha ha ha bless your soul  
You really think you're in control  
Well I think you're crazy  
I think you're crazy  
Just like me  
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State  
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar  
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar  
And I know I gave it to you months ago  
I know you're tryna forget  
But between the drinks and subtle things  
The holes in my apologies you know  
I'm trying hard to take it back  
\  
So if by the time the bar closes  
And you feel like falling down  
I'll carry you home  
Tonight  
\  
And we'll go straight through the night  
Oh we'll go straight through the night  
\  
And you'll go straight through my heart  
Oh  
And you'll go straight through my heart  
Oh  
And you'll go straight through my heart  
Oh  
And you'll go straight through my heart  
Oh  
And you'll go straight through my heart  
Oh

Uh-uhh I was thinkin' 'bout her thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah it was only just a dream
So I travel back down that road
Who she come back No one knows
I realize yeah it was only just a dream


I was at the top and I was like "I'm at the basement"
Number one spot and now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
I should've put it down should've got that ring
‘Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face run my fingers through her hair
My lover my life
My shawty my wife
She left me I'm tied
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right


Uh-uhh I was thinkin' 'bout her thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah it was only just a dream
So I travel back down that road
Who she come back No one knows
I realize yeah it was only just a dream


When I be ridin' man I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryin' to get my usher on but I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
Oh I miss her when I learn yeah I miss her quick she was gone
I swear to God I feel like everything I ever knew is gone
I said "I'm about to go to war" 'cause I miss a baby
And I don't even know for sure


Uh-uhh I was thinkin' 'bout her thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah it was only just a dream
So I travel back down that road
Who she come back No one knows
I realize yeah it was only just a dream


If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up


And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
Said you're praying that God take you out the misery
And finally you're asking why you fell in love with her
But you're praying to God above that you don't get your heart broken

I'll give you the uncensored lyrics of "Undo It" by Carrie Underwood below:

I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
I should've walked but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand and I let it slide

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be
The way it was before I saw your face

You stole my happy you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

You had my heart now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
But baby all the promises you made were just to pass the time
I should've known by the way you were to me
That every word was a sugarcoated lie

Now I'm gonna have to fool myself
To get you outta my head
For all that you put me through
I'd been better off without you instead

You stole my happy you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

You had my heart now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Eenie meenie miney mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla if if if she holla let her go
Shes indecisive she can't decide
She keeps on lookin' from left to right
Girl cmon get closer
Look in my eyes
Searchin' is so wrong
I'm Mr Right
You seem like the type
To love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after this song
So give me the night
To show you hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone


You can't make up your mind mind mind mind mind
Please don't waste my time time time time time
I'm not tryin' to rewind wind wind wind wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
Cause shorty is a eenie meenie miny mo lova
Shorty is a eenie meenie miny mo lova
Shorty is a eenie meenie miny mo lova
Shorty is a eenie meenie miny mo lova


Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla if if if she holla let her go


Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla if if if she holla let her go
If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Uh oh uh oh

Lord make me a rainbow I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be no
Ain't even gray but she buries her baby

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand

There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life oh well
I've had just enough time

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em oh

The sharp knife of a short life oh well
I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts oh no I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Uh oh uh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em
She grew up on a tightrope
Learned to smile even when she was low
Low
Gotta fix that urge to roam
And then keep you safe "don't wanna keep you alone"
There's nothin' like waking up
At 6 AM to the sound of powdered wheels
On a blanketed freight train
That's headed for someplace but no one knows where
So pour me a glass of that
Kick back real slow and watch the sun rise

Lay me down in a field of daisies
It ain't all roses but it ain't that bad
Through the glass window
She sees her mama and daddy sit down
As they say grace
She clears her mind and thanks the Lord
For all the gifts in her life
Love joy and the helpin' hand of a stranger
Who didn't think twice yeah

So pour me a glass of that
Kick back real slow and watch the sun rise
Through windshield glass yeah

Lay me down in a field of daisies
It ain't all roses but it ain't that bad
She grew up on a tightrope
Learned to smile even when she was low
Well the truth well it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit and ain't never coming back
Girl but before I get to goin' I've got to say I know you used to love me but that was yesterday
And the truth I won't fight it when I say

Girl you know I've got to go
Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey goodbye
Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey goodbye

Listen to me now
I'm goin' to have to go away from ya
Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey goodbye
Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey goodbye

Girl I love you
Yeah I love you but
I gotta go away from this place I've got to quit you
And I ain't never coming back
Girl you know I've got to go
Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey goodbye
Na na na na na na na na
Hey hey goodbye

Look at you girl standing here beside me
The lights are on but nobody's home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't sleep you can't eat
There's no doubt you're in deep
Your throat is tight you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need
Whoa you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it you're addicted to love
You see the signs but you can't read
You're runnin' at a different speed
Your heart beats double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine a one track mind
You can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do
Whoa you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Your lights are on but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine
Whoa you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it you're addicted to love
You might as well face it you're addicted to love
You might as well face it you're addicted to love
You might as well face it you're addicted to love
You might as well face it you're addicted to love
You might as well face it you're addicted to love hey hey
Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy Hey what up girl
Grab my glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit this city Let's go
Before I leave brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes toes
Trying on all our clothes clothes
Boys blowing up our phones phones
Drop-topping playing our favorite CD's
Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop make it pop
DJ blow my speakers up
Tonight I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop no

Oh whoa-oh-oh oh whoa-oh-oh
Don't stop make it pop
DJ blow my speakers up
Tonight I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop no

Ain't got a care in world but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk drunk
Now now we goin' 'til they kick us out out
Or the police shut us down down

Police shut us down down
Po-po shut us down

Don't stop make it pop
DJ blow my speakers up
Tonight I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop no

Oh whoa-oh-oh oh whoa-oh-oh
Don't stop make it pop
DJ blow my speakers up
Tonight I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop no

DJ you build me up
You break me down
My heart it pounds
Yeah you got me
With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah you got me

DJ you build me up
You break me down
My heart it pounds
Yeah you got me
With my hands up
Put your hands up

Tonight I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop no

Oh whoa-oh-oh oh whoa-oh-oh
Don't stop make it pop
DJ blow my speakers up
Tonight I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop no
Maybe I need some rehab or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping hitting my head against the wall

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love 

Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me to think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted it's a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgements getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum
Is my love your drug Your drug

Huh your drug
Huh your drug
Is my love your drug
Huh your drug
Huh your drug
Is my love your drug

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all


When the dark of the night comes around
That's the time that the animal comes alive
Looking for something wild
And now we lookin' like pimps
In my gold Trans-Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag


Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight I don't give a I don't give a I don't give a


I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me now


Early mornin'
City breakin'
I've been drinkin'
Gasoline
And liquor
I never know
Where I'm goin'
But I'm goin'
Gone


I don't know what I'm sippin'
All I know is I'ma be sippin'
I'm taking off and I'm noddin' my head
And I'ma be gone when the Red Sun's dead


I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me now


You can't keep me down
I'm on my way to the top


I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me
I'm taking off don't you try to stop me now
Verse 1:

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive you don't have to try
It comes naturally mmm it comes naturally

And I love the way you know who you are

When you know it's meant to be be
Everything comes naturally rally

Bridge:

Chorus:
It comes naturally
When you're with me baby
Everything comes naturally
I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Off in the night while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice I hope it's gonna make you notice
Someone like me someone like me
Someone like me somebody
I'm ready now I'm ready now
I'm ready now I'm ready now

You know that I could use somebody

Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower

Every time I'm leavin' on ya
You don't make it easy no no
Wish I could be there for ya
Give me a reason to go

Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now oh

I know you're scared of the unknown
You don't wanna be alone
I know I always come and go
But it's out of my control

And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much

Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower

Yeah

I'm more than just an option Hey hey hey
Refuse to be forgotten Hey hey hey
I took a chance with my heart Hey hey hey
And I feel it taking over


I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart


I'm more than just a number Hey hey hey
I doubt you'll find another Hey hey hey
So every single summer Hey hey hey
I'll be the one that you remember


And I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart


It's more than just a mission Hey hey hey
You hear but you don't listen Hey hey hey
You better pay attention Hey hey hey
And get what you've been missing


I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love

You hear but you don't listen
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Alejandro" by Lady Gaga:

I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands in her pockets
And she won't look at you won't look at you
She hides true love en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger
Around you

*NOTE: The lyrics contain some Spanish phrases which have not been translated in the original song
I might make mistakes with my text please compare with the original lyrics to make sure it's accurate


I'm not surprised
Not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times
I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in
I talk myself out
I get all worked up
Then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I thought of every possibility oh

And I know some day that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

Mmmmm 
I might have to wait
I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing
And the other half's luck
Wherever you are
Whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere
And into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility oh

And somehow I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet
They say all's fair
In love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it by it
We'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility oh

And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get
Than I get than I get than I get

Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid to give so much more than I get yeah
I just haven't met you yet
I just haven't met you yet
Oh I promise you kid
To give so much more than I get
I said love love love love love love love
I just haven't met you yet
Love love love love love love
I just haven't met you yet

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh you make me smile


Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that


You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh you make me smile


Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile


You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh you make me smile
Yes I can provide you the uncensored lyrics of "Sexy Bitch" by David Guetta featuring Akon


Yes I can see her
'Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her


They say she low down it's just a rumor and I don't believe them
They say she needs to slow down the baddest thing around town
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood whore
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
Damn girl damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch


Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch


I can't believe it I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it you make my slinky go duh-duh-duh
'Till I'm tired you walk in and outta my life
Just like a thief but you're the only relief
It's obvious the way you move hypnotize us
The way you make your hips circle and if I can have it my way
I'd take that booty home


Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch


The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to that new nelly jam I think someones at the door
But I don't think I'mma answer
Police saying freeze oh how the donuts glazed over
Magazine oh they on me 'cause I'm the one and only
They all wanna blow me I'm still lonely


Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch


I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
Damn girl damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch


Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch a sexy bitch
Damn you're a sexy bitch
