Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace

I keep crying baby baby please

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind
All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Well I hear the music
Close my eyes feel the rhythm
Wrap around take a hold
Of my heart

What a feeling
Bein's believin'
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

What a feeling

He said I am the dancer
You are the dance
He said I am the dancer
You are the dance
He said I am the dancer
You are the dance
He said I am the dancer
You are the dance

What a feeling I am music now
Bein's believin' I am rhythm now
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

What a feeling I can really have it all
Bein's believin' Bein's believin'
Take your passion You can really have it all
And make it happen Bein's believin'
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life
Travelling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail head full of zombie
I met a strange lady she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said:

"Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
You better run you better take cover"

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscles
I said: "Do you speak-a my language"
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:

"I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
You better run you better take cover"

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw and not much to say
I said to the man: "Are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty"
And he said:

"Oh Do you come from a land down under oh yeah yeah
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
You better run you better take cover"

We are living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
You better run you better take cover
Repeat chorus

They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it just beat it


You better run you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough better do what you can
So beat it but you wanna be bad


Just beat it beat it beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it beat it
Just beat it beat it
Just beat it beat it
Just beat it beat it


They're out to get you better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive better do what you can
So beat it just beat it


You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you then they beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it but you wanna be bad


Just beat it beat it beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it beat it beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or who's right


Just beat it beat it beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right


Just beat it beat it beat it beat it

Just beat it beat it beat it beat it

It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming 'round
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes


Turnaround bright eyes but every now and then I fall apart
Turnaround bright eyes every now and then I fall apart


Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream of something wild
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry
Turnaround every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes


Turnaround bright eyes but every now and then I fall apart
Turnaround bright eyes every now and then I fall apart


And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Background vocals: Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time All of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
Background vocals: We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks


Turnaround bright eyes but every now and then I fall apart
Turnaround bright eyes every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Background vocals: Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time All of the time
I don't know what to do I'm always in the dark
Background vocals: We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
Verse 1:
I have a private hell
Of excellent quality
I've dwelt there for years
Playing with my fears
Minding my own business
I've faced my quirks
Lately though my terrors
Tend to interrupt
The boundary lines
I draw upon myself

Chorus:
So welcome to the nightmare
In my head
Say hello to something scary
The monster in your bed
Just give in and let it
Take control
So close your eyes and let the
Maneater eat you whole

Verse 2:
It's not paranoia
When they're after you
It's not paranoia
When the voices are true
So celebrate the times
Let your colors fly
They'll be taking down the signs yeah
Oh that used to make you high

Chorus:
So welcome to the nightmare
In my head
Say hello to something scary
The monster in your bed
Just give in and let it
Take control
So close your eyes and let the
Maneater eat you whole

Bridge:
Taking on water
Trying to slip away
Finding my way under
Water every day
I'm still looking for you
I'm still looking for you

Chorus:
So welcome to the nightmare
In my head
Say hello to something scary
The monster in your bed
Just give in and let it
Take control
So close your eyes and let the
Maneater eat you whole

Outro:
The maneater the maneater yeah
The maneater the maneater yeah
The maneater the maneater yeah
The maneater the maneater yeah
Thinking back in time
When love was only in my mind
I realize ain't the way I wanted to be

I hope you will
Be understanding
I'm a product of my time
I hope you won't underestimate my point of view

Forgetting all my yesterdays
I'm living for today
No jumping at shadows
Chasing the phantoms of my mind

I'm braver than the army of darkness
And I'm taller than the walls that you build around
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me
Baby can't you see come on and see

Baby come to me Come on and come on to me
And then I'll share with you
All the love I have in me
All the love I have in me

You always knew just how I wanted you to touch me
And you always knew just how to kiss
I never really knew how much I was missing
I know now and I'm ready to surrender my love

Baby come to me Come on and come on to me
And then I'll share with you
All the love I have in me
All the love I have in me

All the stars are out tonight
The moon is silver shining bright
And I know I've waited for this moment for so long
Baby come to me
And then I'll share with you
All the love I have in me
Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night  
Lookin' for the fight of her life  
In the real-time world no one sees her at all  
They all say she's crazy  

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart  
Changing woman into life  
She has danced into the danger zone  
When the dancer becomes the dance  

It can cut you like a knife  
If the gift becomes the fire  
On a wire between will and what will be  
She's a maniac maniac on the floor  
And she's dancing like she's never danced before  

On the ice-blue line of insanity  
Is a place most never see  
It's a hard-won place of mystery  
Touch it but can't hold it  

You work all your life for that moment in time  
It could come or pass you by  
It's a push of the world but there's always a chance  
If the hunger stays the night  

There's a cold kinetic heat  
Struggling stretching for the beat  
Never stopping with her head against the wind  
She's a maniac maniac at your love  
And she's dancing like she's never danced before  

It can cut you like a knife  
If the gift becomes the fire  
On a wire between will and what will be  
She's a maniac maniac on the floor  
And she's dancing like she's never danced before  

Maniac maniac at your love  
And she's dancing like she's never danced before  
Maniac maniac at your love  
And she's dancing like she's never danced before  
Maniac maniac at your love  
And she's dancing like she's never danced before  
Maniac maniac at your love  
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I've traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I've traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Hold your head up keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up movin' on
Keep your head up movin' on
Hold your head up movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Sure Here are the uncensored lyrics:

"You and I"


I Love The Lonely Nights
I Love The Starry Skies
Bearing Witness To
Every Breath You Sigh
I Love The Way You Move
I Love The Way You Dance
I'm Always Waiting
For That Moment To Advance


You And I Can Make It
We Can Take The World With Our Love
You And I Can Make It
And All We've Got Is Time On Our Side


I Love Your Warm Embrace
I Love Your Ruby Lips
If You Make Me Wait Too Long
I'll Just Lose My Grip
I Love Your Every Move
I Love Your Every Smile
In Your Arms
Is Where I Want To Stay A While


You And I Can Make It
We Can Take The World With Our Love
You And I Can Make It
And All We've Got Is Time On Our Side


We've Got To Be The Luckiest People
In The World To Find Something Like This
Two Hearts That Beat As One
So Close Together


You And I Can Make It
We Can Take The World With Our Love
You And I Can Make It
And All We've Got Is Time On Our Side


You And I Can Make It
You And I Are Going All The Way
Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
He moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried and sang along
Who'd blame them
You're grown so grown now I must say more than ever
Come on Eileen
Toora loora toora loorye ay
And we can sing just like our fathers
Come on Eileen oh I swear well he means
At this moment you mean everything
With you in that dress my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah come on Eileen
Come on Eileen
These people round here wear beaten down eyes
Sunk in smoke dried faces
They're resigned to what their fate is
But not us no not us
We are far too young and clever
Come on Eileen
Toora loora toora loorye ay
And you'll hum this tune forever
Come on Eileen oh I swear well he means
Ah come on let's take off everything
That pretty red dress Eileen tell him yes
Ah come on
Come on Eileen
Woo-hoo come on
Come on Eileen
Toora toora toora loorye ay
Aye oh woohoo
Come on Eileen
Oh I swear well he means
Ah come on let's take off everything
That pretty red dress Eileen tell him yes
Ah come on
Ah come on Eileen oh I swear well he means
At this moment you mean everything to me
Ah come on Eileen oh I swear well he means
At this moment you mean everything to me
Ah come on Eileen oh I swear well he means
At this moment you mean everything to me
Ah come on Eileen
Till you've been beside a man
You don't know what he wants
You don't know if he cries at night
You don't know if he don't

When nothin' comes easy
Old nightmares are real
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know how he feels

Once inside a woman's heart
A man must keep his head
Heaven opens up the door
Where angels fear to tread

Some men go crazy
Some men go slow
Some men go just where they want
Some men never go

Oh blame it on midnight
Ooh shame on the moon

Everywhere it's all around
Comfort in the crowd
Strangers faces all around
Laughin' right out loud

Hey watch where you're goin'
Step light on old toes
'Til you've been beside a man
You don't know who he knows
We'll stay together  
Ooh come what may  
My love I'll always want you  
And need you every day  
Never gonna let you go  
Cause I oh girl I love you so  
I'll never let you go  
No no no  
Swear by all the stars above  
I'll never I'll never let you go  
Oh oh oh  
I'll never let you go  
Don't you know  
Never gonna let you go  
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever  
Gonna try and make up for all the times  
I hurt you so  
Go tell that guy  
Who you were kissing in the parkin' lot  
Oh I won't stand for it  
I won't stand for it  
I know we've had our problems  
But I promise we're gonna make it this time  
'Cause baby you're all I've got  
Never gonna let you go  
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever  
Gonna try and make up for all the times  
I hurt you so  
Never gonna let you go  
I'm gonna love you more than ever  
Just wanna hold you in my arms  
Never gonna let you go  
Never gonna let you  
Never gonna let you go  
Never gonna let you go  
Never gonna let you go
Darken the city night is awire
Steam in the subway earth is afire
Do-do do do do do do do do
Woman you want me give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do-do do do do do do do do
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Smell like I sound I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I’m on the hunt I’m after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I’m hungry like the wolf
Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I’ll be upon you by the moonlit side
Do-do do do do do do do do
High blood drumming on your skin it’s so tight
You feel my heat I’m just a moment behind
Do-do do do do do do do do
In touch with the ground
I’m on the hunt down I’m after you
Scent and a sound I’m lost and I’m found
And I’m hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line its discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine I’m after you
Mouth is alive all running inside
And I’m hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Burning the ground I break from the crowd
I’m on the hunt I’m after you
I smell like I sound I’m lost and I’m found
And I’m hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line its discord and rhyme
I’m on the hunt I’m after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
I’m hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Do-do do do do do do do do
Do-do do do do do do do do
Do-do do do do do do do do

Somewhere in a lonely hotel room
There's a guy starting to realize
That eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two am


It's two am the fear has gone
I'm sittin' here waitin' the gun's still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances


Yeah there's a storm on the loose sirens in my head
I'm wrapped up in silence all circuits are dead
I cannot decode my whole life spins into a frenzy


Help I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse feels like being home
My beacons been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far


Soon you will come to know
When the Bullet Hits the Bone
Soon you will come to know
When the Bullet Hits the Bone


I'm falling down a spiral destination unknown
Double crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection can't get through where are you


Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline


When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated


And he says


Help I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse feels like being home
My beacons been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far


Help I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse feels like being home
My beacons been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far
Yea sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Know There's Something Going On" by Frida:

I can see that it won't be long
You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed and your words they lie
That's something you can't deny

I call you're not at home
You're home but you're not alone
If you wanna leave then why don't you say
Your love has gone anyway

I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on

I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's been some heavy things going on
I can feel it coming yeah

Day by day minute by minute
Will I be in it Or out
In your life or in your way
Will you keep me around

I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on

I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
There's been some heavy things going down

I'm not denying that I'm inclined to be
Jealous petty and unkind
I'm just saying that I need to see
What it is that drives you on

And keeps you going strong

I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on

I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's been some heavy things heavy things
Going on going on
It's poetry in motion
She turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
Mmshe blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
And failed me in biology
When I'm dancing close to her
"Science" science
I can smell the chemicals
"Science" science
"Science"
Mmscience
Mmscience
Mmscience
I can hear machinery
"Science" science
It's poetry in motion
And now she's making love to me
The spheres're in commotion
The elements in harmony
She blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
And hit me with technology
"Good heavens Miss Sakamoto you're beautiful"
"Hmwot about me"
"You're not too bad yourselfoh"
"She blinded me with science"
"She blinded me with science"
"S-s-s-s-s-sa a a a a a Science"
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy she's waiting there for you
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
What hijinks we had in Swindon
Almost forty years ago
There were nothing else to do
But hey you know
Looking for a ride to your secret location
Where the kids are setting up a barricade
Got my own Chevy '69
How strange when you know
Everything changed
We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love but it's never enough nah
As the cars pass us by
I'm left to wonder why
You have to do me this way
And as the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid
We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love but it's never enough nah
As the silence meets the crowd
Caught a glimpse of you and I
And it falls apart
Innocence corroded
We're dancing in the minefields
We're sailing in the storms
This is bravely so
Hey
Sailing
Hey
Sailing
We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love but it's never enough nah
We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love but it's never enough nah
As the storm subsides to silence
And the trees uprooted one by one
You can't tell me perfect love will take me home
Back to my younger days when life was fun
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real I keep it alive

Love lift us up where we belong
Where eagles cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on to "used to be"
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our lives out there to find

Love lift us up where we belong
Where eagles cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know up where the clear winds blow

Time goes by no time to cry
Life's you and I alive today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where eagles cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know up where the clear winds blow
Verse 1:
Baby you'll find
There's only one love
Yours and mine
I've got so much love
And needing you so

My love for you
I'll never let go
I've got so much love
All I want is to hold you

Let me show how much I love you baby

Chorus:
You are
My love my life my everything
You are
My soulmate my sweetest friend indeed

Verse 2:
The way you touch me
My love just comes naturally
It's all because you're there
My heart is full of love
And it's all for you

So hold me tight
Baby let's never part
I've got so much love
And it's all for you baby

Let me show how much I love you

Chorus

Bridge:
Whenever you need me I'll be there
Forever and always I swear
Together we'll conquer we'll survive
Cause you are my life

Chorus
Zwei drei vier one two three
It's easy to see
But it's not that I don't care so
'Cause I hear it all the time
But they never let you know
On the TV and the radio

She was young her heart was pure
But every night it's gettin' worse gettin' worse
See she was not a victim of
Her circumstance circumstance
The TV man is crazy
Saying "We're juvenile delinquent wrecks"
Oh man I need TV when I got T Rex
Oh brother you guessed
I'm a dude cruisin' chrome
And my gang is the loudest
This town has ever known

We blame society but we are society
You me and that guy over there
This is society
Yeah don't try to rear me neighbor
Just pass me on by
And I'll be straight
Just give me some gas
And let me loose

Two three four one two three four
Oh don't try to rear me neighbor
Just pass me on by
And I'll be straight
I'm the king of Bongo baby
I'm the king of Bongo Bong

Listen to me baby
Maybe you wonder where I've been
I search to find love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let it go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let it go

Somebody screamed out "What's all this"
"You"ve got to work to pay the Devil his due"
Oh no baseball bat dance hall crash
Glitter band my aftershave
Malaria can't touch this 

Zwei drei vier one two three
It's easy to see
But it's not that I don't care so
'Cause I hear it all the time
But they never let you know
On the TV and the radio

She was young her heart was pure
But every night it's gettin' worse gettin' worse
See she was not a victim of
Her circumstance circumstance
The Kommissar's in town oh oh
He's got the power and you're so weak
And your frustration ah it needs a tweak
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the ritz
Different types who wear a daycoat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper
Super duper
Come let's mix where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks or "umberellas"
In their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz

Have you seen the well-to-do
Up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air
High hats and Arrow collars
White spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime
For a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
When you're dancing and laughing and finally living
Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly

Do you know you're thinking:
It's the saddest thing that I've ever seen
Well did you ever dream that it could have been different
Did you ever see the tears when I looked in your eyes
Maybe that was a moment that you never forgot
Maybe time erased the memory
Just tell me how you feel

Keep feeling Fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling
Fascination
Looking learning
Moving on

Well the truth may need some
Re-arranging
Stories to be told
And plain to see the facts are changing
No meaning left to hold

And so I'd like to know when
You got the notion
And I'd like to know why there's no
Emotion
And in this broken heart
She laid down her head
Oh did she just give up and
die too soon

Keep feeling Fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling
Fascination
Looking learning
Moving on
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Time Clock of the Heart" by Culture Club:

Don't put your head on my shoulder
Sink me in a river of tears
This could be the best place yet
But you must overcome your fears

Chorus
Ooh in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel like they got something real
But you and me we know we got nothin'
But time
And time won't give me time

Don't make me feel any colder
Time is like a clock in my heart
Touch we touch was the only thing
And my heart is like a clock and it's never wrong
And love's a gamble and it's yours to lose

Chorus
Ooh in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel like they got something real
But you and me we know we got nothin'
But time
And time won't give me time
Oh Mickey you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind

Oh Mickey you're so pretty can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey do Mickey
Don't break my heart Mickey

Hey Mickey
Now when you take me by the hooves who's ever gonna know
Every time you move I let a little more show
There's something we can use
So don't say no Mickey

So come on and give it to me any way you can
Any way you wanna do it I'll take it like a man
Oh please baby please
Don't leave me in the freezer

Hey Mickey
You're simply fine you blow my mind
Hey Mickey
Hey Mickey
You're simply fine you blow my mind
Hey Mickey
I need love love  
To ease my mind  
I need to find find someone to call mine  
But mama said  
"you can't hurry love  
No you'll just have to wait"  

She said "love don't come easy  
But it's a game of give and take"  
You can't hurry love  
No you'll just have to wait  
Just trust in a good time  
No matter how long it takes  

Now break:  

How many heartaches must I stand  
Before I find the love to let me live again  
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on  
When I feel my strength yeah it's almost gone  
I remember mama said  

"You can't hurry love  
No you'll just have to wait"  
She said "love don't come easy  
It's a game of give and take"  
How long must I wait  
How much more can I take  
Before loneliness  
Will cause my heart heart to break  

No I can't bear to live my life alone  
I grow impatient for a love to call my own  
But when I feel that I I can't go on  
Well these precocious words keeps me hangin' on  
I remember mama said  

"You can't hurry love  
No you'll just have to wait"  
She said "love don't come easy  
It's a game of give and take"  
You can't hurry love  
No you'll just have to wait  
Just trust in a good time  
No matter how long it takes  

Now wait  
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Separate Ways Worlds Apart" by Journey:

Here we stand
Worlds apart hearts broken in two two two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground I'm reaching for you you you
Feelin' that it's gone
Can't change your mind
If we can't go on
To survive the tide love divides

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways

If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain pain pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain in vain in vain
If you must go I wish you love
You'll never walk alone
Take care my love miss you love
Only time will tell us Only time

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways

If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "One on One" by Hall & Oates:

One on one I wanna play that game tonight
Yeah one on one I know I wanna play that
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow

You'd like to know if I could play
My game without mistakes
Well I'm not the kind that likes to lose
I'd rather give it all I've got to use

You know that practice makes perfect
And I'm practice every day
I know that you're just what I've been looking for
One on one I wanna play that game tonight

One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know I wanna play that
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow

You know I love playing with fire
And you love to play with me
Just one-on-one you and me baby
We'll play by our own rules we'll have nothing to lose

You know that practice makes perfect
And I'm practice every day
I won't let go of your hand if you won't let go of mine
One on one I wanna play that game tonight

One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know I wanna play that
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow
Well we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line

Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers in the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow

And we're living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay
Well we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved

So these are the things that you can't forget
The good times the bad times the things you regret
When the world was just going too fast for you
And love wasn't something you thought you knew

And we're living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay
And we're waiting here in Allentown
No problem Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Stand Back" by Stevie Nicks:

No one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First he took my heart then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I say unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand take me home

Stand back stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright it's alright
To be standing in a line

Standing in a line
I would cry standing in a line
It's alright it's alright
To be standing in a line

And if you take the time to look
You will find that I am kind
And if you don't well I won't mind
But just don't waste my time

Stand back stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright it's alright
To be standing in a line

Standing in a line
I would cry standing in a line
It's alright it's alright
To be standing in a line

No one knows how I feel
What I say unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand take me home

Stand back stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright it's alright
To be standing in a line

Standing in a line
I would cry standing in a line
It's alright it's alright
To be standing in a line

Stand back stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright it's alright
To be standing in a line

Standing in a line
I would cry standing in a line
It's alright it's alright
To be standing in a line
Though you may not believe me now
I always will remember you as soft and as gentle as a dove
Though sometimes I've fallen
I'm glad I've got the chance to say:


Tell her about it tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her let her know how much she means

Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To fulfill your needs
With the absence of a place to be
You'll have to find who you're and then
Do you like the destination you've reached


Tell her about it tell her everything you feel I love you
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real I love you
Tell her about it tell her all your crazy dreams I love you
Let her know you need her let her know how much she means




Tell her about it tell her everything you feel I love you
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real I love you
Tell her about it tell her all your crazy dreams I love you
Let her know you need her let her know how much she means


Tell her about it tell her everything you feel
Tell her about it tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it The girl don't want to wait too long
You gotta tell her about it
> gone=1
I walk along the city streets
You used to walk along with me
And every step I take reminds me
Of just how we used to be

Well how can I forget you girl
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

Whoa whoa whoa

When shadows fall I pass a small cafe
Where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt
To kiss and hold you tight

Well how can I forget you girl
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

Whoa whoa whoa

How can I forget you girl
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
I can provide the uncensored lyrics of "Dirty Laundry" by Don Henley:

I make my living off the evening news
Just give me something
Something I can use
People love it when you lose
They love dirty laundry

Well I coulda been an actor
But I wound up here
I just have to look good
I don't have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear
Give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em all around

We got the bubble-headed bleach-blonde
Who comes on at five
She can tell you about the plane crash with a gleam
In her eye
It's interesting when people die
We got dirty laundry

Just leave well enough alone
Eat your dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're stiff
Kick 'em all around

Dirty little secrets
Dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
We love to cut you down to size
We love dirty laundry

We can do "The Innuendo"
We can dance and sing
We all know that crap is king
Give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up
Kick 'em when they're down

Kick 'em when they're up

We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
We love to cut you down to size

We can do "The Innuendo"
We can dance and sing
We all know that crap is king
Give us dirty laundry
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love the way you make me feel
I love it love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it love it

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love the way you make me feel
I love it love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it love it

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

She's mine she's mine
No no no she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Too Shy" by Kajagoogoo:

Time will see your tears
Ever changing
All your life the same
You can find another love

Tears for Fears
They were used to play
Watching through the years
All your life you'll never hide it
Twisting words that you say

And if you're saying goodbye
Please don't you think me unkind
And if you're thinking of me
You know that I'm here to remind you

That what you said was true
I'm unaffected by the things you do
And if you're saying goodbye
Please don't you think me unkind

It's only what I've been through
Though I'm sure I'll be told
My love will never grow
I can find another love

Ow ow ow ow ow
Ow ow ow ow ow
Ow ow ow ow ow
Ow





With pleasure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Goody Two-Shoes" by Adam Ant:

With the heartbreak open
So much you can't hide
Put on a little makeup makeup
Make sure they get your good side good side
If the words unspoken
Get stuck in your throat
Send a treasure token token
Write it on a pound note pound note

Don't drink don't smoke
What do you do
Don't drink don't smoke
What do you do
Subtle innuendos follow
There must be something inside

We don't follow fashion
That'd be a joke
You know we're gonna set them set them
So everyone can take note take note
When they saw you sleeping
Climbing out of your hole
Sh-t

Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars

Don't drink don't smoke
What do you do
Don't drink don't smoke
What do you do
Subtle innuendos follow
There must be something inside
Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep he can't hang around

Our house in the middle of our street
Our house in the middle of our

Our house it has a crowd
There's always something happening
And it's usually quite loud
Our mum she's so house-proud
Nothing ever slows her down and a mess is not allowed

Our house in the middle of our street
Our house in the middle of our

Our house in the middle of our street
Our house in the middle of our

Something tells you that you've got to get away from it
Father gets up late for work
Mother has to iron his shirt
Then she sends the kids to school
Sees them off with a small kiss
She's the one they're going to miss in lots of ways

Our house in the middle of our street
Our house in the middle of our

I remember way back then when everything was true and when
We would have such a very good time such a fine time
Such a happy time
And I remember how we'd play simply waste the day away
Then we'd say nothing would come between us two dreamers


Our house in the middle of our street
Our house in the middle of our street
Our house in the middle of our street
Our house in the middle of our our house

Gloria you're always on the run now
Running after somebody you gotta get him somehow
I think you've got to slow down before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown so be careful not to show it


You really don't remember was it something that they said
All the voices in your head calling Gloria


A-ha-ha a-ha-ha Gloria how's it gonna go down
Will you meet him on the mainline or will you catch him on the rebound
Will you marry for the money take a lover in the afternoon
Feel your innocence slipping away don't believe it's comin' back soon


And you really don't remember was it something that they said
All the voices in your head calling Gloria


Gloria don't you think you're fallin'
If everybody wants you why isn't anybody callin'
You don't have to answer leave them hangin' on the line oh-oh-oh calling Gloria-a-a-a
Gloria Gloria I think they got your number Gloria
I think they got the alias Gloria that you've been living under Gloria
But you really don't remember was it something that they said
All the voices in your head calling Gloria


Gloria Gloria how's it gonna go down
Will you meet him on the main line or will you catch him on the rebound
Will you marry for the money take a lover in the afternoon
Feel your innocence slipping away don't believe it's coming back soon
And you really don't remember was it something that they said
All the voices in your head calling Gloria
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Affair of the Heart" by Rick Springfield:


I know you're afraid to commit to anyone
You tell yourself you're happy don't need anybody
But there's another voice that's in your head now
Telling you to hold on but don't be afraid now


An affair of the heart
Don't cha know that it's magic
An affair of the heart
Better take precautions
It's an affair of the heart

You heard about my reputation
You know I'm never gonna settle down
Oh you're just waitin' in the shadows
For your time to come around


An affair of the heart
Don't cha know that it's magic
An affair of the heart
Better take precautions
It's an affair of the heart


Love is a flame burning within
And we must share this heat
Again and again and again




An affair of the heart
Don't cha know that it's magic
An affair of the heart
Better take precautions
It's an affair of the heart
An affair of the heart
Don't cha know that it's magic
An affair of the heart
Better take precautions
It's an affair of the heart
Well don't you know that she's a beauty
A purebred in-betweenity
She's a piece of work and a mystery
She's everything a girl should be hmm
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

She's a goddess on a throne
She's a diamond in the rough
She's a heartache waiting to happen
She's a high-stepping coloratura
She's a dreamer in a dream
And a schemer with a scheme
She's a killer in a crowd
And a dealer with a hand

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

And she walks like she talks
And she talks like she knows
And she knows what you do
Cause she's been there before
She's a beauty she's a beauty
Why would I lie
Why would I lie

Well don't you know that she's a beauty
An untouched picturesque anomaly
She's a pleasure of a privateer
She's everything a girl should be hmm

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

And she walks like she talks
And she talks like she knows
And she knows what you do
Cause she's been there before
She's a beauty she's a beauty
Why would I lie
Why would I lie

Ooh why would I lie
Verse 1:
There was a man a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared that went unshared
Until it died within his silence

Chorus:
And Solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

Verse 2:
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire

Chorus:
And Solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

Bridge:
And Solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

Outro:
Solitaire
Solitaaaaaire
Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone
Away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself
Ain't missing you at all

I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing


I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up mornings where's my little China girl
I hear hearts beating loud
Place is crazy lights are hazy
We go walking knee-deep in snow
She cries and screams "I don't want to go"


I hear a sound without the crowd
I hear a voice inside me loud
I will be free oh to reach the clouds
My head is swimming consumed by sound
Consumed consumed


I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up mornings where's my little China girl
I hear hearts beating loud
Place is crazy lights are hazy
We go walking knee-deep in snow
She cries and screams "I don't want to go"
Verse 1:
Oh you're supposed to be my friend 
But I cannot pretend  
That I don't see through  
What you're trying to do 
And offering me  
Anything I want for free    
I've started to refuse     
To let you make me choose 

Chorus:
Promises promises    
It's all just promises    
It's all just lies   
To cover up your lies    
Promises promises    
Why do I believe    
Promises promises    
When I know what they mean 

Verse 2:
I always thought that you were kind    
But now I see that I was blind  
You do anything to please   
Taking me right to my knees 
And offering to help me out   
But with that comes a lot of doubt    
I don't know what to do     
When I'm surrounded by 'the crew' 

Chorus:
Promises promises    
It's all just promises    
It's all just lies   
To cover up your lies    
Promises promises    
Why do I believe    
Promises promises    
When I know what they mean 

Bridge:
I can't believe     
That I'm deceived    
The words are scattered    
The meaning battered    
I can't believe    
It's hard to conceive  
That you're not what you seem    
It's just a dream    

Chorus:
Promises promises    
It's all just promises    
It's all just lies   
To cover up your lies    
Promises promises    
Why do I believe    
Promises promises    
When I know what they mean

Promises promises

As requested here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Other Guy" by Little River Band:

I took her home it was a Friday night
I paid attention in the taxi ride
She was okay but I was kinda nervous
She took me up to her fourth-floor nest
She undressed I must confess
That I was ready to go but I was still kinda nervous
When you're with somebody gotta tell them that you want 'em
That you love 'em gotta make 'em understand
If you're thinking 'bout somebody gotta tell them that you need 'em
That you miss 'em that you want them to be your man
I remember we were lying there
And we talked about love we talked about life
She said "Baby don't you worry
'Cos I'm not in a hurry" And I smiled like I was Mr Cool
But my insides feelin' like a one way street
I asked her how 'bout another drink
But she said "No let's go to bed"
And I was ready to go but I was still kinda nervous
When you're with somebody gotta tell them that you want 'em
That you love 'em gotta make 'em understand
If you're thinking 'bout somebody gotta tell them that you need 'em
That you miss 'em that you want them to be your man
When you're with somebody gotta tell them that you want 'em
That you love 'em gotta make 'em understand
If you're thinking 'bout somebody gotta tell them that you need 'em
That you miss 'em that you want them to be your man
Oh yeah when you're with somebody gotta tell them that you want 'em

If you're thinking 'bout somebody gotta tell them that you need 'em
That you miss 'em that you want them to be your man
I know just what to do Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Making Love Out of Nothing at All" by Air Supply:

I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie

I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

And I know the night is fading
And I know the time’s gonna fly
And I’m never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I’ve gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break ‘em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don’t know how to leave you
And I’ll never let you fall
And I don’t know how you do it
Making love out of nothing at all

Out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun
Are streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it’s lost
And it’s looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright

I’ve gotta follow it ‘cause everything I know
Well it’s nothing till I give it to you
I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock

I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

But I’m never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I’m never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Making love out of nothing at all

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Straight from the Heart" by Bryan Adams:

I could start dreaming but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreaming
Straight from the heart

You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Coming straight from the heart

Oh give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

I see you on the street some other time
And all our words would just fall out of line
While we're dreaming
Straight from the heart

Oh give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not pretending
It's just a feeling
Coming straight from the heart

Oh give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

Oh give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Heart to Heart" by Kenny Loggins:

Looking around me
I can see my life before me
Running rings around the way
It used to be
I am older now I have more than what I wanted
But I wish that I had started long before I did
And there's so much time to make up everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away


When you were young did you question all the answers
Did you envy all the dancers who had all the moves
Could you come to terms with a failure
Did you learn to love the living did you teach yourself to sing

Looking back at me
I can see that I've been frightened
I've been drawn along the lines
That run beside the edge
But I'm not alone I have more than what I came for
I was looking for an answer when I found you there
And there's so much time to make up everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away



Looking around me
I can see my life before me
Running rings around the way
It used to be
And I am older now I have more than what I wanted
But I wish that I had started long before I did
And there's so much time to make up everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away

There's no telling what could happen to this world baby
But I'm confident that I'll be ready for love

In a world where we'll be free to love one another

But I'm not worried 'bout that now

Under the big top world
We all need the clowns
To make us smile
Through space and time
Always another show
Wondering where I am
Lost without you

And being apart ain't easy
On this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy
Of rediscovering you
Oh girl you stand by me
I'm forever yours

Whooa oh-oh-ooh
Whooa oh-oh-ooh oh

Faithfully
I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
Ever yours

Yes here are the uncensored lyrics to "Steppin' Out" by Joe Jackson:

Now 

The mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes
We 
So tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say
Can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

Me babe steppin' out 
Into the night 
Into the light 
You babe steppin' out 
Into the night 
Into the light

We are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the TV and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight
You 
Can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while
If you follow me

Me babe steppin' out 
Into the night 
Into the light 
You babe steppin' out 
Into the night 
Into the light 

We 
So tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say
Can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

Me babe steppin' out 
Into the night 
Into the light 
You babe steppin' out 
Into the night 
Into the light 

Me babe steppin' out 
Into the night 
Into the light 
You babe steppin' out

Well alright let's do this Here are the uncensored lyrics of "She's Sexy + 17" by Stray Cats:

Well she's got her daddy's car
And she cruised to the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now
And she'll have fun fun fun
Till her daddy takes the T-Bird away

Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now
A lot of guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
And she'll have fun fun fun
Till her daddy takes the T-Bird away

Well you knew all along
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now
But you can come along with me
'Cause we've got a lot of things to do now
And we'll have fun fun fun
Now that daddy took the T-Bird away
Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
Fun fun fun until daddy took the T-Bird away

When you're feeling down and your heart's on the ground
And you think you've lost another round
Reach out your hand and I'll pull you through
There ain't nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you

We gotta keep our love alive

And you feel like giving up on love

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I've Got a Rock 'n' Roll Heart" by Eric Clapton:

I've got a feeling we could be serious girl;
Right at this moment I could promise you the world
Before we go crazy before we explode
There's something 'bout me baby you got to know you got to know

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll I've got a rock and roll heart

Feels like we're falling into the arms of the night
So if you're not ready don't be holdin' me so tight
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain
Here's what you're gettin' and I don't want to change I don't want to change

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll I've got a rock and roll heart

Oh I don't need to worry I don't need to fuss
I don't need to hurry I don't need to rush
And I want to thank you babe for lettin' me into your house
I'm gonna leave this love and shout

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll I've got a rock and roll heart

I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll I've got a rock and roll heart
Time I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life lyin' on the sand watching seabirds fly
Wishing there would be someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you it's telling me it might be you
All of my life
Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place would I recognize the face
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah it's telling me it might be you
So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And there's so much love to make
I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life
I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more no one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah and I'm feeling it'll just be you
All of my life it's you yeah
It's you it's you
I've been waiting for all of my life

You better watch what you say
You better watch what you do to me
Don't get carried away
Girl if you can do better than me go
Yeah go but remember


Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky babe
You got lucky babe when I found you


You put a hand on my cheek
And then you turn your eyes away
If you don't feel complete
If I don't take you all of the way then go
Yeah go but remember


Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky babe
You got lucky babe when I found you


I sing this song to an audience of one

[Domo arigato Mr Roboto
Mata au hi made
Domo arigato Mr Roboto
Himitsu wo shiri tai]

You're wondering who I am-machine or mannequin
With parts made in Japan I am the modern man

I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin
My heart is human my blood is boiling my brain IBM

So if you see me acting strangely don't be surprised
I'm just a man who needed someone and somewhere to hide
To keep me alive-just keep me alive

Somewhere to hide to keep me alive

I'm not a robot without emotions-I'm not what you see
I've come to help you with your problems so we can be free
I'm not a hero I'm not a saviour forget what you know
I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control
Beyond my control-we all need control

I need control-we all need control

I am the modern man who hides behind a mask
So no one else can see my true identity

[Domo arigato Mr Roboto
Mata au hi made
Domo arigato Mr Roboto
Himitsu wo shiri tai]

Thank you very much Mr Roboto
For doing the jobs that nobody wants to
And thank you very much Mr Roboto
For helping me escape just when I needed to
Thank you-thank you thank you
I want to thank you please thank you

The problem's plain to see too much technology
Machines to save our lives machines dehumanize

The time has come at last
To throw away this mask

[Domo arigato Mr Roboto
Mata au hi made
Domo arigato Mr Roboto
Himitsu wo shiri tai]
Verse 1:
I don't bother chasing mice around
I slink down the alley looking for a fight
Howling to the moonlight on a hot summer night
Singin' the blues while the lady cats cry
"Wild stray cat you're a real gone guy"

Chorus:
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class and I got cat style

Verse 2:
I don't bother chasing rats around
I slink down the alley looking for a fight
Howling to the moonlight on a hot summer night
Singin' the blues while the lady cats cry
"Wild stray cat you're a real gone guy"

Chorus:
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class and I got cat style

Bridge:
If I'm out traipsing late at night
Wondering which way to go
I just stop and look at my big old feet
And I say "Am I right right right"
I'm just a sittin' here on the street
Watching the people pass me by
I'm just a stray cat there's nothing else I can do
But "Stray cat strut – I'm a ladies' cat"

Chorus:
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class and I got cat style

Outro:
Ooh yeah
Oh well keep on strutting you're a real gone cat
Ooh yeah
Oh well keep on strutting you're a real gone cat
Keep on strutting you're a real gone cat
Keep on strutting you're a real gone cat
Girl tell me only this
That I have your heart for always
And you want me by your side
Whispering the words I'll always love you
And forever I will be your lover
And I know if you really care
I will always be there
Now I need to tell you this
There's no other love like your love
And I as long as I live
I'll give you all the joy

Let me hold you
I need to have you near me
And I feel with you in my arms
This love will last forever
Because I'm truly
Truly in love with you girl

Head over heels with your love
I need you and with your love I'm free
And truly you know you're all I need
Oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Let me hold you
I need to have you near me
And I feel with you in my arms
This love will last forever
Because I'm truly
Truly in love with you girl
I'm truly
Head over heels with your love
I need you and with your love I'm free
And truly you know you're all I need
I'm truly in love with you girl
I'm truly in love with you girl
I'm truly in love with you girl
I'm truly in love with you girl
They put a parking lot on a piece of land
Where the supermarket used to stand
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local Palais
That's where the big bands used to come and play
My sister went there on a Saturday
Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing it's only natural
Another Saturday another date
She would be ready but she'd always make them wait
In the hallway in anticipation
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek
Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing my sister always did
Floor shines like a mirror
She's scrubbed it with an old rag
The broadcast from the late night music shows
The count down is the big one boys come on let's go
Going to a go-go dancing at the disco
Corner of the street where the big men meet
My sister went out with a guy from the city
He said he'd take her places that she'd never been
But he took her to a burger bar
He took her to a movie
He took her to a roadside stop
On the longest night of her life
Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing it's only natural
Why not come dancing it's only natural
Looking back I guess it shows  
That we were too young to know  
Now I'm  frightened to be alone  
Oh  terrified of dying young  
But now I'm  standing on your shore  
And I'll never be  quite alone  
Cause I know that  
One more time  
Is all I'll need  
I won't hold you back now  
The love we had  
Just can't be found  
Lost in memories  
Of the love we had  
I'll leave you with this broken song  
And know that wherever you are  
You'll hear me whisper on the wind  
I'll never forget you my love  
One more time  
Is all I'll need  
I won't hold you back now  
The love we had  
Just can't be found  
Lost in memories  
Of the love we had   
I won't hold you back now  
The love we had  
Just can't be found  
Lost in memories  
Of the love we had
Well there's a little boy waiting at the counter of a corner shop
He's been waiting down there waiting half the day
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around knocked to the ground he gets to his feet and he says

What about me it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

Well there's a pretty girl serving at the counter of the corner shop
She's been waiting back there waiting for her dreaming boy
She never ever sees him from the top
He gets pushed around knocked to the ground
He gets to his feet and he says

What about me it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

There's a man in a box by the freeway exit down by the coast
He's been there for years a hundred thousand beers
And they take his coins but they won't give them back to him
Just one more year and I'll be gone the system'll be all right

What about me it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

What about me it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

What about me
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Pass the Dutchie" by Musical Youth:

This generation
Rules the nation
With version
Music happen to be the food of love
Sounds to really make you rub and scrub

I say
Pass the dutchie on the left-hand side
Pass the dutchie on the left-hand side
It a gonna burn give me music make me jump and prance
It a go done give me the music make me rock in the dance
You know
Say we play it on the radio
A warning I will give you
It's a simple message and it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself for that's the place to start

And I say
Pass the dutchie on the left-hand side
Pass the dutchie on the left-hand side
It a go done give me the music make me jump and prance
It a going to nice give me the music make me rock in the dance
It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
So I left my gate and went out for a walk
As I was strolling on the beach
My mind was dwelling on nonsense
Like "I wonder what the dreadlocks a' cooking tonight"
A'ong-eria ng-eria ng-eria ng-ay
A'ong-eria ng-eria ng-eria ng-ay
Two men a' come with two pound of weed
Two men a' come with two pound of weed
A'ong-eria ng-eria ng-eria ng-ay
A'ong-eria ng-eria ng-eria ng-ay
Come on and keep me rockin'
All in the dance pass the dutchie
Come on and keep me rockin'
All in the dance pass the dutchie
'Cause I'm sittin' and I'm starin' 
At all the food upon my plate
Oh the peas they taste so lovely 
And the rice is nice and whitey 
But man I'm starving raving
See me rocking in the dance
Pass the dutchie on the left-hand side
Pass the dutchie on the left-hand side
It a go done give me the music make me jump and prance
It a go done give me the music make me rock in the dance
My love
There's never been a doubt in my mind
That I'd come to you
For answers and find
All that I've been searching for
Forevermore
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems that the natural thing to do
Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too
Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds
When I make love to you Tonight
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new
Tonight we will both discover
How friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you Tonight
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun
Is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do
Is to get close to you
Tonight tonight
I celebrate my love for you
Tonight
If you'd like I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Don't Cry" by Asia:

Verse 1:
In a world where the gods are crazy
And the heavens can't be found
I stand alone my dreams and hopes
Frozen solid on the ground

Chorus:
Don't cry baby don't cry
The worst is gone and the best is yet to come
Don't cry baby don't cry
I'll wrap my arms around you and never let you go

Verse 2:
In a time when the world is changing
And the tides of fate are high
I'm reaching out my heart unchained
And my soul about to fly

Chorus:
Don't cry baby don't cry
The worst is gone and the best is yet to come
Don't cry baby don't cry
I'll wrap my arms around you and never let you go

Bridge:
And every night I pray to heaven above
To send me someone to love
And every day I wait for you to say
That you belong to me

Chorus:
Don't cry baby don't cry
The worst is gone and the best is yet to come
Don't cry baby don't cry
I'll wrap my arms around you and never let you go

Outro:
No don't you cry baby don't you cry
I said the worst is gone and the best is yet to come
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans

'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one but the kid is not my son
Get up get up get up get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
'Cause you do it right

Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us

Sexual healing baby is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the things you're dealing
Oh I can tell you darling that it's sexual healing

Get up get up get up get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
'Cause you do it right

And if you want to hear something sweet
We can go to bed and complete
Each other desires yeah

And if you're feeling weak
We can turn the lights down and get deep
Making love until our strength is gone

'Cause darling I know you are the one
The only one who can love me like you do
And heal my wounds with a touch
And I'll be grateful every day
For how you make me feel this way baby

And when you're giving me that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us

Sexual healing baby is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine


I say we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
And we can dance


We can go when we want to
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat
From our hats to our feet
And surprise 'em with a victory cry


I say we can act if we want to
If we don't nobody will
And you can act real rude and totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile


I say we can dance we can dance
Everything's under control
We can dance we can dance
We're doing it wall to wall


We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine


I say we can dance we can dance
Everything's under control
We can dance we can dance
We're doing it wall to wall


We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine
The lawyers clean-cut

Innocent and pure

They hope that no one

Sees the heartless way they're

Living as the lawyers in love

Aren't we all confused

About love and what it's supposed to do

Anyway they always

Seem to start out fine

Oh but then they lose

Their heads along the line

And oh you know them the lawyers in love

Making love after they argue

But why can't we just argue sometimes

Tell me who has the time

And oh you know them the lawyers in love

Sometimes you feel like you're

Sinking and there's nothing you can do

So you just keep on dancing

Closer to the flame

Knowing you're never

Going to be the same again

And oh you know them the lawyers in love

Making love after they argue

But why can't we just argue sometimes

Tell me who has the time

And oh you know them the lawyers in love

Aren't we all confused

About love and what it's supposed to do

It's far from over
We're so much closer
Soon we'll find a way
To face the day


We'll say hello again
I do believe we'll make it
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna let you see me cry


It's far from over
We're so much closer
Soon we'll find a way
To face the day


We'll say hello again
I do believe we'll make it
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna let you see me cry


It's far from over
We're so much closer
Soon we'll find a way
To face the day


I don't wanna say goodbye no
I don't wanna let you see me cry
It's far from over
We're so much closer
Soon we'll find a way
To face the day
I would be happy to Here are the uncensored lyrics to "Little Red Corvette" by Prince:

I guess I shoulda known
By the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See you're the kinda person
That believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave'em fast

I guess I must be dumb
'Cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say "What have I got to lose"

And honey I say
Little Red Corvette
Baby you're much too fast oh
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last
I guess I shoulda closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill
When I saw all the pictures of the jockeys that were there before me

Believe it or not I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class oh
But it was Saturday night I guess that makes it all right
And you say "Baby have you got enough gas"

And I say Little Red Corvette
Baby you're much too fast yes you are oh
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last oh oh

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over baby gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little Red Corvette
Baby you're much too fast oh
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last hey oh

Little Red Corvette
Honey U got 2 slow down yeah yeah

Credits

Just for a moment
The world was on my side
And I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feelin' down and cold
Trying to believe
That you're gone
My love
Can't you see that


Nobody wants it to end
If there's a chance that love can mend
I'll give my all to you
We'll make it through
I beg you don't let it end
this is the uncensored version and certain words may be offensive or inappropriate for some audiences please proceed with caution
You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold and lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win
Well look at me I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

No I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'd be happy to provide the uncensored lyrics of "All This Love" by DeBarge:

Ooh crazy
I go I go I go
Feelin' crazy when I can't find my way
And the weather's too cloudy
Comes a lady she's making me stay
All I wanna do is get back to sunny days
People tell me I'm a fool to stay
I don't mind I guess they're right
But I love this girl and I know I might
Just die without her loving arms
Baby listen to me
All this love is waiting for you
My baby my darling all this love is waiting for you
Ooh baby
My darling all this love is waiting for you
All this love is waiting for you
Now my mind is confused and it's hard to see
What I wanna do and where I wanna be
But with you there baby I can see your lovelight
It shines the way and it gets me through the night
People tell me I'm a fool to stay They say I'm crazy
People tell me I should get away Get away
But with you baby I just don't know
Just don't know
All this love is waiting for you
My darling my baby all this love is waiting for you
My darling my baby all this love is waiting for you
All this love is waiting for you
Hey baby ooh baby

He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means

Verse 2:
Don't know what it means when I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun

Don't be sad 'cause two out of three ain't bad
Don't be sad 'cause two out of three ain't bad

Chorus x2
Don't you feel like trying something new
Don't you feel like breaking out
Or breaking us in two
You don't do the things that I do
You want to do things I can't do
Always something breaking us in two
You and I could never live alone
But don't you feel like breaking out
Just one day on your own
Why does what I'm saying hurt you
I didn't say that we were through
Always something breaking us in two

I was dreamin' when I wrote this forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin' could've sworn it was Judgment Day
The sky was all purple; there were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction you know I didn't even care


They say two thousand zero zero party over
Oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine


I was dreamin' when I wrote this so sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us my mind says prepare to fight
So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen to my body tonight


Yeah they say two thousand zero zero party over
Oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine
Alright nineteen ninety-nine


I was dreamin' when I wrote this forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin' could've sworn it was Judgment Day
The sky was all purple; there were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction you know I didn't even care


Say say two thousand zero zero party over
Oops out of time
We're runnin' outta time
So tonight we gonna we gonna tonight I'm gonna party like it's nineteen ninety-nine


I was dreamin' when I wrote this forgive me if it goes astray

Tryin' to run from the destruction you know I didn't even care

Hmph it's cold but it's nice
Thank you
Now the king told the boogie men  
You have to let that raga drop  
The oil down the desert way  
Has been shakin' to the top  
The sheik he drove his Cadillac  
He went a' cruisin' down the ville  
The muezzin was a' standing  
On the radiator grille  
The sharif don't like it  
Rockin' the casbah  
Rock the casbah  
The sharif don't like it  
Rockin' the casbah  
Rock the casbah  
By order of the prophet  
We ban that boogie sound  
Degenerate the faithful  
With that crazy Casbah sound  
But the Bedouin they brought out  
The electric camel drum  
The local guitar picker  
Got his guitar picking thumb  
As soon as the sharif  
Had cleared the square  
They began to wail  
The sharif don't like it  
Rockin' the casbah  
Rock the casbah  
The sharif don't like it  
Rockin' the casbah  
Rock the casbah  
Now over at the temple  
Oh They really pack 'em in  
The in crowd say it's cool  
To dig this chanting thing  
But as the wind changed direction  
The temple band took five  
The crowd caught a wiff  
Of that crazy Casbah jive  
The sharif don't like it  
Rockin' the casbah  
Rock the casbah  
The sharif don't like it  
Rockin' the casbah  
Rock the casbah  
The king called up his jet fighters  
He said you better earn your pay  
Drop your bombs between the minarets  
Down the Casbah way  
As soon as the sharif was chauffered outta there  
The jet pilots tuned to the cockpit radio blare  
As soon as the sharif was outta their hair  
The jet pilots wailed  
The sharif don't like it  
Rockin' the casbah  
Rock the casbah  
The sharif don't like it  
Rockin' the casbah  
Rock the casbah  
He thinks it's not kosher  
Fundamentally he can't take it

Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day
Angel ghost or mystery
Guess I'll try wait and see
All my friends who used to be
Friends they wouldn't lie to me
But now I ask and no one knows
Where the hell the river goes


I don't want to say
I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna burst at the seams
If I could only see
How messed up my mind has been
Then everything would be alright
Everything would be alright


Lose myself in mysteries
But I'm caught in a web I can't escape
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've got myself together
I'm a different man altogether
But I'm not competent no
For a love not gonna last


I don't want to say
I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna burst at the seams
If I could only see
How messed up my mind has been
Then everything would be alright
Everything would be alright


If I could only see
If I could only see
If I could only see
Everything would be alright
If I could only see
If I could only see
If I could only see
Everything would be alright


I don't want to say
I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna burst at the seams
If I could only see
How messed up my mind has been
Then everything would be alright
Everything would be alright
Verse 1:
And fiery demons all dance when you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me you're about as easy as a nuclear war
And I love all the things you do like torture me and tie me to the bed
And all those things you said I can't get them out of my head

Chorus:
Is there something I should know
Is there something I should say
Or am I dreaming again
Is this nightmare never-ending

Verse 2:
My heart beats faster when you're near you're driving me insane
I try to run but I can't escape you're always in my brain
And every time I close my eyes all I see is your face
I'm addicted to your touch your love is my disgrace

Chorus:
Is there something I should know
Is there something I should say
Or am I dreaming again
Is this nightmare never-ending

Bridge:
And I don't wanna play this game you're playing with my heart
But I can't resist the way you make me feel when we're apart
And I don't wanna lose control but you've got me in a trance
Just tell me what you want from me and give me one more chance

Chorus:
Is there something I should know
Is there something I should say
Or am I dreaming again
Is this nightmare never-ending

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

I'll do my best to comply with your request Here are the uncensored lyrics of "True" by Spandau Ballet:

Ah hah hah hah

So true funny how it seems
Always in time but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul

This love is the way I feel
And I know I know that it's real
So don't you fool around
I'm gonna pull it pull it pull it pull it

Quietly now Giving a meaning high to the
Make believeing Here we go Silent surrender souls
Walked in together heartbeats Moved by the same wind
Showing a smile When we Hiding our pain think Sharing our dreams Believe me

So true I love you

Hold on Holding back the feeling Being uptight Nowadays
Hard to be sure When you Drag me down I'll be around
Good times For a change Leaves are The way they are So unkind
To remind us Though we Await the change Since the

Only time will tell if you can figure this one out:

"Look what you've done
Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough"

"We've been livin' on a knife-edge
Budgets tight edges rough
But we're keepin' our heads above the water
Makin' love on the beaches toes in the sand
We're takin' photographs of all the scars we left
Then we rewind and do it all again" 

"
Look what you've done
Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough" 

"I got your photograph
But baby who you're lookin' at
I got your photograph
But baby who you're lookin' at
Who you're lookin' at who you're lookin' at
Who you're lookin' at who you're lookin' at now" 

"
Look what you've done
Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough" 

"I seen you before
Turn and walk away
You know you've got the stare of a carnivore
But always got a smile on your face
And when there's nothin' left to say" 

"
Look what you've done
Photograph I don't want your
Photograph I don't need your
Photograph all I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough"
She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right 

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right 

Onetta there in the corner stand
And wonders where she is and
It's strange to her some people seem
To have everything 

Nine am on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
Just waitin' for her clientele 

Twenty eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there 

It's a sacrifice working day to day
For little money just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
To hear them say that they care 

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right 

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right 

Whoo-hoo-hoo whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-hoo whoo-hoo-hoo 

Oh she didn't plan to stay here
In the restaurant business
But she had to learn the trade
Working nights to keep alive 

She was working one night a hostess
When just one glance
And he made her heart sing
They fell in love 

He was a young boy
From a college town
He said "Quit your job
And come with me if you'd like
My love I'll give you more
Than any other 

Took her money
And he broke her heart
She took all he had
And it wasn't much 

She left him alone in the city
'Cause he wouldn't give her none 

Whoo-hoo-hoo whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-hoo whoo-hoo-hoo 

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right 

She works hard for the money
So hard for it honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right 

Whoo-hoo-hoo whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-hoo whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-hoo whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-hoo whoo-hoo-hoo
Give me all your loving
All your hugs and kisses too
Give me all your loving
Don't let up until we're through

I'm searching for this feeling
That I never seem to find
Love don't come so easy
But it can be so blind

Hurt so blind
Love can be
Hurtful too
Yes it's true

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island time-traveling diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Precious kisses words that burn me
Lovers never ask you why

In my heart the fires burning
Choose my color find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step a step too far

Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry

Words are few I have spoken
I could waste a thousand years
Wrapped in sorrow words are token
Come inside and catch my tears

You've been talking but believe me
If it's true you do not know
This boy loves without a reason
I'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything is not what you see
It's over again
I can provide the lyrics to the best of my abilities but please note that the song contains mature themes that may not be suitable for all audiences 

I know it's late I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see

Why should we worry no one will care girl
Look at the stars so far away
We've got tonight who needs tomorrow
We've got tonight babe why don't you stay

Deep in my soul I've been so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching even after today

So there it is girl I've said it all now
And here we are babe what do you say
We've got tonight who needs tomorrow
We've got tonight babe why don't you stay
