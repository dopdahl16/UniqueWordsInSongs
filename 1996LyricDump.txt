Hey Macarena

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away so far away


Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive alive


And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day


Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared


And I miss the love we shared


Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You'll always listen as I pray


And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day


Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You'll always listen as I pray


And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right

For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all


You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me


You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach

You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you


You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me


You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you


You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'coz you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me


I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
Verse 1:
I pretend that I'm glad you went away
But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dyin' inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm cryin' inside and nobody knows it but me

Chorus:
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can see it so clearly but you're nowhere around

Verse 2:
The nights are lonely the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get you could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
And I'm still open and nobody knows it but me

Chorus:
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can see it so clearly but you're nowhere around

Bridge:
Oh who knows maybe baby you've got your reasons
Why you're gone
But my world is feelin' kinda small
Without you I'm so alone

Verse 3:
I'm still fallin' and nobody knows it but me
I cry out loud but nobody hears how
Deep down inside and I'm hurtin'
And nobody knows it but me

Chorus:
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can see it so clearly but you're nowhere around

Outro:
I'm cryin' inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
We were as one babe  
For a moment in time  
And it seemed everlasting  
That you would always be mine 

Now you want to be free  
So I'm letting you fly  
'Cause I know in my heart babe  
Our love will never die no 

You'll always be a part of me  
I'm part of you indefinitely  
Boy don't you know you can't escape me  
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby  

And we'll linger on  
Time can't erase a feeling this strong  
No way you're never gonna shake me  
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby  

I ain't gonna cry no  
And I won't beg you to stay  
If you're determined to leave boy  
I will not stand in your way  

But inevitably you'll be back again  
'Cause you know in your heart babe  
Our love will never end no  

You'll always be a part of me  
I'm part of you indefinitely  
Boy don't you know you can't escape me  
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby  

And we'll linger on  
Time can't erase a feeling this strong  
No way you're never gonna shake me  
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby  

I know that you'll be back boy  
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder oh  
I know that you'll be right back baby  
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time  

You'll always be a part of me  
I'm part of you indefinitely  
Boy don't you know you can't escape me  
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby  

And we'll linger on  
Time can't erase a feeling this strong  
No way you're never gonna shake me  
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby  

You'll always be a part of me you will always be  
I'm part of you indefinitely our love will never die  
Boy don't you know you can't escape me  
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby  

And we'll linger on we will linger on  
Time can't erase a feeling this strong  
No way you're never gonna shake me  
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby  

You'll always be my baby you will always be  
You'll always be my baby you will always be  
You'll always be my baby you will always be  
You'll always be my baby
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around

Baby I got your number and I know that you got mine
But you know that I called you I called too many times
You can call me baby you can call me anytime
But you got to call me

And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Because I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

I don't want no one to squeeze me they might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me they might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need
This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Want you to know that I love you baby but I got to get out

Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Because I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Miss my Uncle Charles y'all rest in peace
He shouldn't be gone in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong oh so wrong rest in peace
Gotta hold on to his soul cause he's gone
I wonder why this has to happen to my family
And it feel like dying inside
But I gotta be strong
Cause around me there's no telling rest in peace


See you at the crossroads crossroads crossroads

Now tell me whatcha gonna do when there ain't nowhere to run
When judgment comes for you when judgment comes for you
Tell me whatcha gonna do when there ain't nowhere to hide
When judgment comes for you cause it's gonna come for you


Headin' for the open door tell me whatcha waitin' for
Lookin' back it ain't nothin' there for you
Relax your soul let the Lord take control
If you go to heaven you can ride with me
If you go to hell and then you'll see
Ain't nothin' but demons inside of me
So many miracles weed and a death we with the Lord
Ain't worried 'bout dyin'


See you at the crossroads crossroads crossroads
So you won't be lonely

So you won't be lonely


And I'm askin' the good Lord "Why" and sighing
A little something for my homies goodbye goodbye
And I ask Him "Why Why" and sighing
A little something for my homies goodbye goodbye


So you standin' at the crossroads looking all around
Tryin' to find a place where you belong
See some people don't know their direction and that's where they got it all wrong
See we won't let Jahovah sustain us
Most high rules all then those
Who follow their own flesh and bone and ignorance self-destructs y'all


See you at the crossroads crossroads crossroads

When I'm gone
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody
When I'm gone
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody
When I'm gone
Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream  
Of light mists of pale amber rose  
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent  
Touching discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me  
Miles of windless summer night air  
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon  
Out of the stillness soft spoken words

Say it say it again  
I love you always forever  
Near and far closer together  
Everywhere I will be with you  
Everything I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen  
You've got me almost melting away  
As we lay there under a blue sky with pure white stars  
Exotic sweetness a magical time

Say it say it again  
I love you always forever  
Near and far closer together  
Everywhere I will be with you  
Everything I will do for you

Say you'll love love me forever  
Never stop never whatever  
Near and far and always and everywhere and  
Everything

Say it say it again  
I love you always forever  
Near and far closer together  
Everywhere I will be with you  
Everything I will do for you

Say it say it again  
I love you always forever  
Near and far closer together  
Everywhere I will be with you  
Everything I will do for you
I will provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "You're Makin' Me High" / "Let It Flow" by Toni Braxton as requested:

I'll always think of you  
Inside of my private thoughts  
I can imagine you  
Touching my private parts  
With just the thought of you  
I can't help but touch myself  
That's why I want you so bad  
Just one night of  
Moonlight with you there beside me  
All night doin' it again and again  
You know I want you so bad  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby ooh  
I get so high  
When I'm around you baby  
I can touch the sky  
You make my temperature rise  
You're makin' me high  
Baby baby baby baby  
Can't get my mind off you  
I think I might be obsessed  
The very thought of you  
Makes me wanna get undressed  
I wanna be with you  
In spite of what my heart says  
I guess I want you too bad  
All I want is  
Moonlight with you there inside me  
All night doin' it again and again  
You know I want you so bad  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby ooh  
I get so high  
When I'm around you baby  
I can touch the sky  
You make my temperature rise  
Ooh boy you're makin' me high  
I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me  
Let's make a deal you roll I lick  
And we can go flying into ecstasy  
Oh Darlin' you and me  
Light my fire  
Blow my flame  
Take me take me take me away  
I get so high  
When I'm around you baby  
I can touch the sky  
You make my temperature rise  
You're makin' me high  
Baby baby baby baby  
I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me  
Let's make a deal you roll I lick  
And we can go flying into ecstasy  
Oh Darlin' you and me  
Light my fire  
Blow my flame  
Take me take me take me away  
I get so high  
When I'm around you baby  
I can touch the sky  
You make my temperature rise  
Ooh boy you're makin' me high  
I get so high  
When I'm around you baby  
I can touch the sky  
You make my temperature rise  
Ooh boy you're makin' me high  
Baby baby baby baby  
I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me  
Let's make a deal you roll I lick  
And we can go flying into ecstasy  
Oh Darlin' you and me  
Light my fire  
Blow my flame  
Take me take me take me away  
I get so high  
When I'm around you baby  
I can touch the sky  
You make my temperature rise  
Ooh boy you're makin' me high
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Twisted" by Keith Sweat:


Oh yeah baby
You got to make your mind up yeah
Alibi yeah


Girl you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playing
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby yeah
You just wait


We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye


When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around


We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye


Now I don't understand what we're going through
I'm hurting baby I'm for real
My love is true with you is where I wanna be
Girl you know it


We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye


Oh yeah baby
You got to make your mind up
Oh yeah Alibi yeah
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "C'mon N' Ride It The Train" by Quad City DJ's:

Killin' them with intuition

The line forms outside the ride
And the crowd goes crazy

Yo let's ride it's time to meet
The rough necks and the freaks

And your body gets hyped
While the bass drum pounds
You check your mirrors

He-Man on the beat pumpin' that grave
Yo it's starting to rain
So let's make your way to the DJ booth
Don't get nervous but you're in the mood
To dance like you stole something
Come on watch that rhythm
Or shut up and listen


C'mon and ride it woo woo
C'mon and ride it woo woo
C'mon and ride it woo woo

All day thinking about you baby
Lately I'm feeling like I wanna leave
Can't figure out why you're so angry
I'm getting out gonna find me a better place

I'll start again I'll find somebody
Who's gonna love me who's gonna understand
Things you do and the way you hurt me
I'll be searching for a kinder man

Every day I sit and wonder
Will I always be alone
Will I ever find another
Someone to love me like you've never done

I'm leaving now gonna make it easy
This time I'm not coming back
I'm gonna find someone who needs me
Someone who loves me just for who I am

All day thinking about you baby
Lately I'm feeling like I wanna leave
Can't figure out why you're so angry
I'm getting out gonna find me a better place

I'll start again I'll find somebody
Who's gonna love me who's gonna understand
Things you do and the way you hurt me
I'll be searching for a kinder man

Every day I sit and wonder
Will I always be alone
Will I ever find another
Someone to love me like you've never done

I'm leaving now gonna make it easy
This time I'm not coming back
I'm gonna find someone who needs me
Someone who loves me just for who I am
An old man turned ninety-eight 
He won the lottery and died the next day 
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay 
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late 

Isn't it ironic don't you think 
It's like rain on your wedding day 
It's a free ride when you've already paid 
It's the good advice that you just didn't take 

Who would've thought it figures 

Mr Play It Safe was afraid to fly 
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye 
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight 
And as the plane crashed down he thought "Well isn't this nice" 

And isn't it ironic don't you think 
It's like rain on your wedding day 
It's a free ride when you've already paid 
It's the good advice that you just didn't take 

Who would've thought it figures 

Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you 
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right 
And life has a funny way of helping you out when 
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up 
In your face 

A traffic jam when you're already late 
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break 
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife 
It's meeting the man of my dreams 
And then meeting his beautiful wife 

And isn't it ironic don't you think 
A little too ironic and yeah I really do think 
It's like rain on your wedding day 
It's a free ride when you've already paid 
It's the good advice that you just didn't take 
And who would've thought it figures 

And well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you 
And life has a funny way of helping you out 
Helping you out
Every night I say a prayer
In the hopes that there's a heaven
But every day I'm more confused
As the saints turn into sinners

All the heroes and legends
I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside
So afraid that I've lost my faith

Show me the way
Show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away

Please show me the way

And as I slowly drift to sleep
For a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace
In a world so filled with hatred

That I wake up each morning
And turn on the news to find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign
So afraid I just won't know

Show me the way
Show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain
And take my confusion away

And if I see a light
Should I believe
Tell me how will I know

Show me the way
Show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away

Show me the way
Show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage
To believe that I'll get there someday

And please show me the way
Verse 1:
Did you see the sky
I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one last time is all we need
I can't really help it
If my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge is just the farthest
That I've ever been

Chorus:
Any little whisper
Tells me that you want to stay
Don't want to hear it
I'll follow you down
All those wasted years
All those sacred lies
All I see are reasons why
I'll hold you till the hurt is gone

Verse 2:
Ooooh
Can you take the time
'Cuz I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
Fumbling for the words
Scared of what it means to say
Stumbling in the dark
You know that I'm afraid

Chorus:
Any little whisper
Tells me that you want to stay
Don't want to hear it
I'll follow you down
All those wasted years
All those sacred lies
All I see are reasons why
I'll hold you till the hurt is gone

Bridge:
And just when you think
You've got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool you do what you do
And don't try to save me

Chorus:
Any little whisper
Tells me that you want to stay
Don't want to hear it
I'll follow you down
All those wasted years
All those sacred lies
All I see are reasons why
I'll hold you till the hurt is gone

Outro:
And just when you think
You've got me figured out
The season's already changing
Verse 1:
Sittin' in my room I'm bored as hell
I'm tryna hit that 1-800 baby tell me what's the deal
I heard you're talkin' trash girl I oughta smack your mouth
I'm kinda scared of you but let me work it out

Pre-Chorus:
Ooh my mind is set on you
I wanna know all you need to do is

Chorus:
Sittin' up in my room back here thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just a fool in love what can I do
Sittin' here stuck tryna get to know you
I'm just a fool in love sometimes it's like that huh

Verse 2:
I'm actin' kinda shady you ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change Why the cold shoulder baby
I'm kinda confused and I don't know what to do
But all I know is I'm all up in love with you

Pre-Chorus:
Ooh my mind is set on you
I wanna know all you need to do is

Chorus:
Sittin' up in my room back here thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just a fool in love what can I do
Sittin' here stuck tryna get to know you
I'm just a fool in love sometimes it's like that huh

Bridge:
Bounce bounce bounce
Ooh oh oh
What can you do what can you do
When you're just a fool in love
When you got it bad you're just so mad
What can you do what can you do 

Pre-Chorus:
Ooh my mind is set on you
I wanna know all you need to do is

Chorus:
Sittin' up in my room back here thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just a fool in love what can I do
Sittin' here stuck tryna get to know you
I'm just a fool in love sometimes it's like that huh 

Outro:
All that I'm tryna say is trying to explain it to you
It's all good baby babe it's all experience
Any time that you gon' deal with somebody
Somebody gon' be trippin'
But don't let that stop you come on
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window

There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
It's all coming back it's all coming back to me now

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right

There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby baby baby

When you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me

It's all coming back it's all coming back to me now

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me

If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back it's all coming back to me now

When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me

The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

It's all coming back to me now

And when you kiss me like this
It's all coming back to me now
And when I touch you like that
It's all coming back to me now
If you do it like this
It's all coming back to me now
And if we
And if we
All coming back to me now

It's all coming back to me now
And if we fall in love
It's all coming back to me now
It'll be just like starting over
Starting over
If I could reach the stars 
I’d pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart 
So you could see the truth

That this love I have inside 
Is everything it seems 
But for now I find 
It’s only in my dreams

That I can change the world 
I would be the sunlight in your universe 
You would think my love was really something good 
Baby if I could change the world

If I could be king 
Even for a day 
I’d take you as my queen 
I’d have it no other way

And our love would rule 
In this kingdom we have made 
‘Til then I’ll be a fool 
Wishing for a day

That I can change the world 
I would be the sunlight in your universe 
You would think my love was really something good 
Baby if I could change the world

Baby if I could change the world 
I would be the sunlight in your universe 
You would think my love was really something good 
Baby if I could change the world 
Baby if I could change the world

I've been watching you from afar for as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need and ever ask for this is love


Girl listen to me
When I be sitting in my room all alone staring at the walls
Fantasies they go through my mind
And I've come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Loungin" by LL Cool J:


Loungin'
Yo loungin'
Layin' back takin' my time
Layin' back layin' back layin' back


I'm just loungin'
I'm just coolin'
Sittin' in the back seat of my jeep
Pumpin' beats woofer's quakin' uhh
Girls freakin' tims on my feet yeah
Makes me wonder how the hec' did I get this way
Cool as a cucumber in a time of dismay ha
But all work and no play makes me a dull dude check it out
So I gotta get my groove on before I hit the dude uh
A lil' bit of rhythm and a lot of bass uh
Now I'm feelin' good got a smile on my face check it
It's summertime girls in the park
The temperature's hot and the fun's about to start
I'm just loungin'
loungin' loungin' yeah yeah


Loungin'
I'm just loungin'
Loungin'
I'm just loungin'
Loungin'
I'm just loungin'
Loungin'
I'm just loungin'


I'm in the shade and I'm sippin' on lemonade ha
Butter pecan chocolate deluxe even caramel sundaes is gettin' played
Word up
DB Blends coolin' on the corner
Some brothers from the east side call us west coasters
That's right that's right
The things are the same always have and always will
I'm just loungin' I'm using my skills
But in the meantime it's the rap game
Endless meetings almost insane
Money honeys both do the same thing
But if you lose your money can't blame the honeys uh
Mad people think that my life is the joint
But I've been strugglin' like everybody else maybe even more check it
But that's alright I'm bravin' the heights
Takin' my chances and I'm living my life
I'm just loungin'
loungin' loungin' yeah yeah


Loungin'
I'm just loungin'
Loungin'
I'm just loungin'
Loungin'
I'm just loungin'
Loungin'
I'm just loungin'


Yo I'll tell you what
Why don't you double up on that joint right there
And send it out to all the playas out there ha ha
From the north to the south east to the west coast
We're just loungin'
loungin' loungin' yeah yeah
How do you know if you're not really sure

Do you stay or do you go
And if you go what do you do
With your life
What's the next step you take
What's the next step you take
What's the next step you take

How do you know if it's love or not
Is it giving or is it taking
What makes it real
What makes it worth the sacrifice
What makes it worth the sacrifice
What makes it worth the sacrifice

I really ought to leave right now
Said I really gotta go
You know I want to stay with you so much but
I'm really not that strong
You know the way to please me
You know the way to make me cry
Anything that you want to do
I'll be the first to try it
It's not like I haven't been around before
The old playbook is getting a little bit boring

Insensitive it's getting late
You underestimate my tongue cuz my mind's not great
Insensitive I'm trying to be
A better person for society
Insensitive it's getting late
You underestimate my tongue cuz my mind's not great
Insensitive I'm trying to be
A better person for society

It's so hard so hard
To be good to be good
When it's easy when it's easy
To be bad to be bad
When it's easy when it's easy
To be bad to be bad

Insensitive it's getting late
You underestimate my tongue cuz my mind's not great
Insensitive I'm trying to be
A better person for society
Insensitive it's getting late
You underestimate my tongue cuz my mind's not great
Insensitive I'm trying to be
A better person for society
And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Got tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost and thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
But if you could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there
Did you get to be a star
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

We grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
Reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
I won't tell 'em your name
Oooh oooh oooh
I won't tell 'em your name
Ow
People living their lives for you on TV  
They say they're better than you and you agree  
He says "Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls"  
Says "Come here boys there ain't nothing for free"  
Another doctor's bill a lawyer's bill  
Another cute cheap thrill  
You know you love him if you put in your will but  
Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now  
Huh who will save your soul after all the lies that you told boy  
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own  
We try to hustle them try to bustle them try to cuss them  
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue  
Another day another dollar another war another tower  
Went up where the homeless had their homes  
So we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers  
But we caught God we got things to do  
Things to burn like gasoline auction slaves  
To gather praise and sing just like a hymn  
Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now  
Huh who will save your soul after all the lies that you told boy  
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own  
Some are walking some are talking some are stalking their kill  
You got social security but that doesn't pay your bills  
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay  
So you bargain with the Devil say you're ok  
For that car or that big house or that whiskey or that blouse  
And you sit at the table and you say that grace  
And hold your soul in your head  
But who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now  
Huh who will save your soul after all the lies that you told boy  
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own  
Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now  
Huh who will save your soul after all the lies that you told boy  
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own  
Huh who will save your soul if you won't save your own  
Huh who will save your soul if you won't save your own

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Can't Sleep Baby If I" by R Kelly:

Chorus:
I can't sleep 
I can't even close my eyes 
Baby I'm wide awake 
Got me looking so crazy in love 
Why you doing this to me
If loving you is all that I have to do 
I can't sleep baby

Verse 1:
Now even though I try so hard to play it off 
I'm gonna tell you what you mean to me 
How I feel about you 
'Cause every night I go to sleep 
I have you in my heart and in my dreams 
All I know is that you're the one for me 
And I just need you to be in my life

Chorus:
I can't sleep 
I can't even close my eyes 
Baby I'm wide awake 
Got me looking so crazy in love 
Why you doing this to me
If loving you is all that I have to do 
I can't sleep baby

Verse 2:
Every moment we spend together 
It seems like we're getting closer and closer 
Maybe I'm wrong 
Well tell me have you been thinking 'bout us 
Do you love me 
Or am I just in this by myself 
I need to know what's in your heart 
Why can't you tell me 
If loving you is all that I have to do 
I don't want to stop baby

Chorus:
I can't sleep 
I can't even close my eyes 
Baby I'm wide awake 
Got me looking so crazy in love 
Why you doing this to me
If loving you is all that I have to do 
I can't sleep baby

Bridge:
Why you wanna torture me 
Why you wanna hide behind me 
Why you wanna make me think that you're someone else 
I can't take it I can't deal 
I can't keep going on this way yeah

Chorus:
I can't sleep 
I can't even close my eyes 
Baby I'm wide awake 
Got me looking so crazy in love 
Why you doing this to me
If loving you is all that I have to do 
I can't sleep baby

Outro:
I can't sleep babe 
I can't sleep babe 
I can't sleep babe 
I can't sleep babe 
Repeat until fade
 Must have been mid-afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out
And he walked with a limp
Like his old man

And he could talk some
Said "Folk-singing's dying out"
But he took a silver dollar from his pocket
And he showed it to me
Said"Let me show you something little man
This is gold and not a dollar
But it will do for now until the real thing comes around"

I can't ask for nothing
Anymore
There's nothin' left at all

I met her at a church dance
She was preachin' the gospel in rainbow
Her golden hair like a halo
Her eyes green like the fields

And we'd sleep out in the fields
Or maybe in the back of my car
We'd lay down and count
The stars that fall
From the sky

I can't ask for nothing
Anymore
There's nothin' left at all

Somewhere between that sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
You have to find your way
Your way home

I'm afraid of change

Guess that's why we stay the same
Disappointments or expectations
I don't see that I don't see that
I'm afraid of being alone
La-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

I can't ask for nothing
Anymore
There's nothin' left at all

Must have been mid-afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out
And he walked with a limp like his old man
If God had a name what would it be
And would you call it to his face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory
What would you ask if you had just one question

And yeah yeah God is great
Yeah yeah God is good
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face what would it look like
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints
And all the prophets

And yeah yeah God is great
Yeah yeah God is good
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

Trying to make His way home
Back up to heaven all alone
Nobody calling on the phone
Except for the Pope maybe in Rome

And yeah yeah God is great
Yeah yeah God is good
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to heaven all alone
Just trying to make His way home
Nobody calling on the phone
Except for the Pope maybe in Rome
Verse 1:
While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else

Bridge:
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years a fool of a wife
I shoulda have left your ass a long time ago

Chorus:
Well I'm not gon' cry I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

Verse 2:
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet

Bridge:
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave at the drop of a dime 
Swallowed my fears stood by your side
I should have left your ass a thousand times

Chorus

Verse 3:
So you can stop pretending
I know I'm not blindsided yeah
I'm well aware of your new friend
I hope she's worth it don't know what you were thinking
Chorus x2

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the streetlight


We've been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We've been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise


Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool death ain't nothing but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die what can I say
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24
The way things is going I don't know


We've been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We've been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise


Power and the money money and the power
Minute after minute hour after hour
Everybody's runnin' but half of them ain't looking
What's going on in the kitchen but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it how can they reach me
I guess they can I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck fool


We're spending most our lives living in a gangsta's paradise
We're spending most our lives living in a gangsta's paradise
We're spending most our lives living in a gangsta's paradise
We're spending most our lives living in a gangsta's paradise
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me 


We've been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We've been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Yeah 1996 112 Biggie keep doing it
And we gon' rap a long motherfuckin' time


Uhh puffin' on clouds gettin' high couldn't catch me
But with my criminal thoughts I put a dip in your hip-pop
I'm about to set off it's kinda festive
The beat is runnin' through my chest arrest it
I'm talked about distance but that's the issue
Either way it's gettin' done hubba hubba
You don't know me you just met me
You won't let me well if I could I'd like to be
A sort of roofer of my own destiny
Take me away from here it's kinda stressing me
This industry is very tricky
Plus everyone wants to be see the key
Most definitely I'm lyrically Talented that's all me
Maybe probably not speak statistics its unlikely
Up and down like a roller coaster
Can't let go I hear that here we go


Only you can make me feel yeah
Only you can make me feel
Only you can make me feel yeah
Only you can make me feel


Only you can make me feel this way
What you doing to me hey no one else can take your place
What you doing to me

There's nothing better than you


Only you can make me feel yeah
Only you can make me feel
Only you can make me feel yeah
Only you can make me feel


Goodness gracious baby you're the baddest
Not to mention lace us down in minks and furs
Baby you're a mother I wanna smother
In between the sheets that's all I need
As long as I'm with you baby let me bleed
I swear you got a nigga dying of a stroke
Tell me what you need you know I got the doe
Anything you want just let a nigga know


Only you can make me feel yeah
Only you can make me feel
Only you can make me feel yeah
Only you can make me feel


I know what you like I am your prescription
I'm your doctor doctor feel-good
I mean I am what you're thinking of
Lustin' for I'm the one that you're loving for
One thing's for sure I'm always on tour
When I'm finished then I'mma hit it some more
I'm caught up in the lore when you endorphins
Rush like a roller coaster can't get enough
Call your friends let's get up on a conference
Then we can all blaze a philly blunt full of that funk
Sorry Mary Jane but I'm trying to get with you
Let's make a move let's settle down
Let me crow like Prince and you can be the King
Then we can rule the land online like two rebels
I could be more you could be more
Why settle for less when we could be
Got everything you need let me be your down-key


Only you can make me feel yeah
Only you can make me feel
Only you can make me feel yeah
Only you can make me feel


A long time all night all day
Any time that you need me baby you just call me
I'll be there in a hurry don't you worry
I didn't forget about you ladies neither let's go

You're the one for me 
You're the one for me 
You're the one for me 

 
I know that you're somebody else's guy

I just want you to be free 

 
You're the one for me 
You're the one for me

Or asking you to drop your lady or your dreams 
But I'm down for you anyway 
And I'm never gonna let you down 
I'll always be around 

 
You're the one for me 
You're the one for me 
You're the one for me 

 
I can't help the way I feel

So when you're ready to move on 
Just let me know and I'll be gone

You're the one for me 
You're the one for me

Verse 1:
You say that we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart
You say the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

Chorus:
And I said "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's"
She said "I think I remember the film
And as I recall I think we both kinda liked it"
And I said "Well that's the one thing we've got"

Verse 2:
I see you the only one who knew me
And now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong
So what now It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over
When so much is left undone

Chorus

Bridge:
You'll say that we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart
You'll say the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

Chorus
1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  

What up everybody so glad you're here  
It's Coolio with the flow back in your ear  
This ain't a fantastic voyage but I'm still on a mission  
To see if I can get your attention  
Now I want drops some information  
Just a little additive to your education  
I live my life by the code of the funk  
600 watt amps 18s in the trunk  
When I'm on the street you gotta feel my beat  
So throw your hands up if you're down with the C  
Double O L I O with the flow  
I'm lookin' for the party so let a brother know  

1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  
1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  

We gotta let the music take control  
The rhythm's gonna move your soul  
Feet shufflin' eight to the bar  
Won't you take me baby cause I'm not too far  
Movin' with the rhythm you know I'm right  
Can't get enough of that funky stuff  
So why waste time let's jump right in  
Y'all know the time so let's begin  

1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  
1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  

Ain't nothin' but a party y'all  
Ain't nothin' but a party y'all  
Ain't nothin' but a party y'all  

Now I'm on the microphone and I'm rockin' the house  
I'm gonna move you gonna make you shout  
"Rockin' and shockin' and breakin' the beats"  
And when it comes to rockin' rhythm that's my specialty  
I'm like a retriever I'm a golden receiver  
Dedicated to rap and whoever believes a  
Brother like me is automatically down with the cause  
Cause rappin' was my game long before I paused  
I couldn't get with no political party  
Heard all the fuss they screamin' and arguin'  
But since I got this forum I'm gonna say  
What I want that's right - funky Kool Medina  

1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor  
Gotta gotta get up to get down  
Gotta gotta get up to get down

1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor  
Gotta gotta get up to get down

Has our conscience shown
Has the sweet breeze blown
Has all the kindness gone
Hope still lingers on

I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why

Are we listening
Hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see
That love is gathering

All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one into one

I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why don't know why

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know

I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why

But she reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Oh oh oh
Oh sweet child o' mine

Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet

Junebug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see that we don't get fooled

Maybe I'm the afterglow
'Cause I'm catching fire like a drop in snow
I gamble for my love
And this cooler is for my head

So goodnight
To every little angel in my sight
'Cause years ago through stars and tears
I made a vow to die for you

In our teens
We grow to see
Our home
Is where we'll be

And bloody noses lead
To dinner freezes
And tainted luck

No elegies or eulogies
No sentimental bastards pleasantries

A song for the deaf that is for you
A song for the deaf you can't even hear it

And he sleeps inside my dreams
And he sleeps inside my dreams

And he sleeps inside my dreams

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Time" by Hootie & the Blowfish:

Time why you punish me
Like a wave bashing into the shore
You wash away my dreams
Time why you walk away
Like a friend with somewhere to go
You left me crying
Can you teach me 'bout tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow running free
'Cause tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in time
Time I don't understand
Children killing in the streets
Dying for the color of red
They say we're all created equal
But ain't that what they wrote
Just words on the page just words on a page
I fall behind I fall behind
In this war against your life
Time why you punish me
Like a wave bashing into the shore
You wash away my dreams
Time why you walk away
Like a friend with somewhere to go
You left me crying
Can you teach me 'bout tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow running free
'Cause tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe
Been known to say fool fool
What the hell have they done to you
You think that I can't live without your love
You'll see
You think I can't go on another day
You think I have nothing
Without you by my side
You'll see

Somehow some way
You think that I can never laugh again
You'll see
You think that you destroyed my faith in love
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home
You'll see

Somehow someday
All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine no one can take it from me
You'll see

You think that you are strong but you are weak
You'll see
It takes more strength to cry admit defeat
I have truth on my side
You only have deceit
You'll see somehow someday

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine no one can take it from me
You'll see

You'll see
You'll see
You think that you are strong but you are weak
You'll see
It takes more strength to cry admit defeat
You'll see
You'll see
You'll see somehow someday
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Last Night" by Az Yet:

Last night you were so into it
You told me secrets that you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love

I drank your wine as you taste mine
I kissed your lips you felt mine
You felt my body slip Into your soul

I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night I was inside you
Last night while making love to you
I saw the sun the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night there was no planning it
It was so special and so very innocent
We talked of memories our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love

And deep into the night right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight in your soul
You felt incredible I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night I was inside you
Last night while making love to you
I saw the sun the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night / Grooving sentimental yeah
Last night / Grooving instrumental

Last night I was so into you
Last night while I was making love to you

The mountains and the rivers

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding

Do Me a favour
I need y'all to lay back and listen
Woo-hah woo-hah

I be smoking drinking
Thinking 'bout sinking
Making my way to the store to get me more henny and gin
Feeling on like I need a hand on my Johnson
Feeling like I'm living the life of a pirate uh huh
If you wanna grab a get-rax bring it on
I'll kick a hole in your speaker pull the plug then I jet
Back to the lab without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a kick outta making my allies pee in they pants
The game plan to fan the spark into the flame
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A doggone shame I kick myself when I play myself
Like Shaquille O'Neal the real is the anthem
The phat one's are slamming the jigga-judder is slamming
I slam good with the hood Uptown is slamming
I slam good with the hood Brooklyn is slamming
I slam good with the hood Long Island is slamming
I slam good with the hood Queens is slamming
I slam good with the hood New Jersey is slamming
I got people in the back jiggling with your Knickerbockers
Slow down my brother you're working too fast

Action satisfaction as all the brothers in the party

And then they went and got into a four line
And did the snake moan and hum and inch by inch
And watch the doctor Jimmy grow

Doin' it doin' it and doin' it uh huh
I'm supercalafragalisticexpiala-dopin' it uh huh

Straight pounds and pounds and pounds of this dope flavor
I'm not quittin' MC's bitten their tongue cause they're dying on
Biting more than they can chew
Don't let your mouth open up too wide
Cause I'm back to reclaim my throne
Just when you thought I was gone
I brewed the storm I raised the moon
And when there's competition I eat 'em like a coconut
Radio Brothers I don't be forgetting
To say goodnight uh-huh and turn off all of the lights


Woo-hah woo-hah
Got you all in check
Woo-hah woo-hah
Got you all in check
Woo-hah woo-hah

As I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up wheel up bring it back come rewind
Powerful impact boom From the cannon
Not bragging try to read my mind just imagine

Eating an MC it's like eating some tosht
My favourite dish is fish but I don't like no pork

As we take flight the night is still young
Mastering flows that go on and on
Master we have to deal with these faker MCs
Who can't seem to rhyme and every single time
We continue to shine Flippin'
On these new drug rappers stinkin' like a dirty diaper
All I do is dip up in ya with a style so sick up in ya
Who's ready to Stay fat with the beats we be dropping
Getting everyone jumping rocking and bumping

We gonna burn the roof right off the mother brother ya don't stop haaaaaaa
We gonna put you on to something obscene what's the meanin' It means Everything Remains Raw haa

And keep it clean I get shit you see
Gone with the wind pass us in shadows

Flexing with the skills that show you all who's boss

Got you anxiously waiting for the CD
In the meantime we got you fiendin' with the B-sides

Verse 1:
I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you

Chorus:
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise boy that I'll be true you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to yeah

Verse 2:
If you thought I'd sleep on this kind of feeling boy you're wrong

Verse One:
One for the money yes sir two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good where me and my n***as rode
The Marta through the hood just trying to find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round trying to catch that feeling
Off instrumental had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot known that we could rock
Dudes dyin' to catch a duece to the corner of the block
We're the wise we know not to trust a glock
I learned to duck a turtle and dodge a sucka' MC
If feels like I'm bustin' caps for sheer comedy
So much tragedy we've done brought on ourselves
So much agony we've gone through hell it's a shame
I was like "He's what's happening"
An old friend from high school
He started rappin' they signed a couple of contracts
Top dawg and down that's what they told me
A class startin' up but where I don't know
Chorus:
Elevators me and you
Me and you your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Verse Two
Back in the day when I was younger hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that R-O-double-S
Shit raw leather that the Scotty's put on the feel
We claim other like them fraudelent Zurich deals
I'm 'fore real here to express not impress
Depressed but let my problems rest
N***as at the door I'm fallin' hear me comin'
S**t I'm on probation I don't think they'll be 'ye
Legal lights in my life and now smoke alarms too
Got a beeper and a cell phone and home too
Nocturnal is being incarcerated slept it
Do your time when you're locked up on the street you're dead
Hip-hop and the basic fundamentals too many rookies
That's why these flows sound so recycled
I crept and I came I wasn't lovin' my fame
Who was to blame It's Sarge had the dope in the veins
Fat fat fat beats and the RL coupe
'99 I let them stole me and introduced me to love
Chorus:
Elevators ooh uhh ooh uhh ooh uhh ooh
Me and you your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Elevators me and you
Me and you your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Verse Three:
What's that D-R-U-G spell drug
N***a 'cause a n***a LD skeeted and hit the throttle
And IV couldn't tell what them what is sipped
And we had a few beers to pull now we had no beer
Now the coast was clear we didn't hear he gone
The Windish groove I had my truck bumpin' on
She got in the back and opened her book bag
And said N***a let's get to splurging do you know anybody who got Allegra
Almost crashed trying to save her but it's cool
My baby mama beepin' f*****g up my mood
It's getting dark and the sky looks like ready for war
It's kind of scary ain't it making legendary music trading places
Alligator bags and money stashes fat-sipping Cognac 'passes
Kerry gold by the masses we lean like thugs against the wall
Bout to feel ten-foot tall sporting shows and shorts
and Bobby socks heart beatin' fast let's M-A-S-H
Do it till the middle of the street backstabbers I keep

Chorus:
Elevators me and you
Me and you your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Elevators ooh uhh ooh uhh ooh uhh ooh
Me and you your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Elevators me and you
Me and you your mama and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on Vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors

It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks


Because the hook
Brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook
Brings you back
On that you can rely


There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue I refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow


Was that the hook
Brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook
Brings you back
On that you can rely


Suck it in suck it in suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin to see
What you're doing to me this MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's okay I'll say it anyway
If you're bloody Mary we're on our way
If you're Mary Jane then there's no shame
If you're Jane Hathaway come and join the game


The hook
Brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook
Brings you back
On that you can rely


Play it

I'm doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens she was raised out in Jersey
I said "How'd you like to keep on doin' it" lyin' on your back girl or sittin' on top of me

What The L the L the L the L
I'm in the zone take a look at the scoreboard
Clockin' every minute that the crowd can applaud
Hostile block interruptin' ya party
Sorry to leave umcees toasted and charred
I explode on sight I'm out for the cash
I hit a joint with a beat that make the head nod
My gat's loaded up with lyrics that's rugged and raw
I'm ready to die why Cause I live for the funk
I'm a nasty nigga when you pass me look
Don't be scared show me what you got up in your gut girl
You better get it ain't no need to be afraid
What you need to do is repeat after me say

I'm doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens she was raised out in Jersey
I said "How'd you like to keep on doin' it" lyin' on your back girl or sittin' on top of me

Uh uh uh
Tisk tisk to the wisdom listen to the twist 'em
As I flip 'em and hit 'em and still be lookin' for some head
When I rock the sheet want y'all to know that I'm the one who's in control
Bizzy make the beat that hits so sweet
When I hold the microphone stop the beat like this
And make the fellas wanna get ill get live get down for life
Gettin' jiggy with 'em like it's 1995
Everybody's gettin' loose when the L's in the house
They be wettin' their panties yes yes y'all
They be wettin' their panties yes yes y'all

I'm doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well
I represent Queens she was raised out in Jersey
I said "How'd you like to keep on doin' it" lyin' on your back girl or sittin' on top of me
Alright here are the uncensored lyrics for "Fastlove" by George Michael:


Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down


Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby can't you read the signs
I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby I ain't Mr Right
But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough


Had some bad love
Some fast love is all that I've been thinking of


Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
They're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun
I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby I ain't Mr Right
But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough


Ooh ooh baby yeah
Ooh ooh yeah
GET UP


Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be


Some find it in the face of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you've found that special thing
You're flying without wings


Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry
You'll find it in the deepest friendship
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

Uh-huh This is for the lovers strictly for the lovers
Yeah You got somebody and wanna get it on right now
I got somebody and we 'bout to get it on right now ya heard

Sure here are the lyrics of "Children" by Robert Miles without any labels additional commentary censorship or information:

If you want to arrange it
This world you can change it
If we could somehow make this
Christmas thing last

By helping a neighbor or even a stranger
To know who needs help you need only just ask

If you want to paint it
Brighter than sunshine
If you want to

You can make the sun shine
Anytime you like

If you want to sing out
Sing out sing out
For love

La la la la la
La la la la la

Chorus:
Closer to free
Closer to me
And everybody's got to stand their ground
Everybody's got to be their own man
Everybody's got to stand their ground
Everybody's got to be their own man

Verse 2:
It's a tangled web we weave
When we practice to deceive
But we're caught and we're all
And we're all deceived
And everybody's trying to be
Just who they want to be
And everybody's trying to be
Free

Chorus:
Closer to free
Closer to me
And everybody's got to stand their ground
Everybody's got to be their own man

Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

'Cause I'm just a girl little ol' me
Don't let me out of your sight
I'm just a girl all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

Oh I've had it up to here

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh I'm just a girl guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes

Oh I'm just a girl take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh I've had it up to here

Oh am I making myself clear
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be

I'm just a girl living in captivity
Your rule of thumb make me worrisome
I'm just a girl what's my destiny
What I've succumbed to is making me numb

I'm just a girl my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
I'm just a girl lucky me
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison

Oh I've had it up to

Oh I've had it up to

Oh I've had it up to here
Verse 1:
I can't tell ya I gotta keep it myself
Don't think that I don't love ya cause it ain't that
Gotta keep my cool gotta keep it together
Cause I can't be with you my friends don't understand

Chorus:
If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you if she knew
And if your girl could only see
How you be calling me getting fresh with me
If your girl only knew
That I would want to be with you if she knew
And if your girl could only see
How you be freaking me wanting me
Baby you don't know a damn thing ooh

Verse 2:
About my feelings for you
I keep this all inside because I know
If I tell you you might lose control
Come chill with me I wanna kiss ya baby
Don't want to love ya but I gotta have ya
What a feeling in my soul I'm not complete
Tell me baby can you handle me

Chorus

Bridge:
Ooh I can't keep away from you
I don't wanna I don't wanna
Ooh I can't keep away from you
I don't wanna I don't wanna be with nobody else but you

Verse 1:
We were young and we were foolish
We were easy to deceive
Said we'd never grow old
We would never believe
I remember those nights
I was standing by the shore
And I saw you little girl
You were walking with your friends
You might have been a child then
But you were already a star
And I knew there was never really any good
In keeping you very far

Chorus:
I saw you first I took my chance
One glance was all it took
I saw you first yeah I made a move
One look was all it took

Verse 2:
We were two young lovers
We were lost in a dream
We were hiding from the world
And we were running from a dream
We were foolish and wild
We were never alone
Two kids on a beach
Just making our way home
Now it's been so many years
Since we shared those summer nights
And there's still a place in my heart
That only you can find

Chorus:
I saw you first I took my chance
One glance was all it took
I saw you first yeah I made a move
One look was all it took

Bridge:

But the way you looked that night
Will stay with me forever

Verse 1:
Well an old man said to me
"Long before these crowded streets
Here stood my dreaming tree"
Below it he would sit
For hours at a time
Now progress takes away
What forever took to find

Chorus:
And he says "I'm so lost
Not at all well
Well I'm so lost
Not at all"

Verse 2:
And if the seasons change
Will you stand by me
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
But someday I'll be
A man so proud and tall
And when the hard times come
A-ha-ha-ha
We'll stand together
Together and won't fall

Chorus:
And he says "I'm so lost
Not at all well
Well I'm so lost
Not at all

Bridge:
And there's an old man sitting on a throne
Now he knows what he knows
And there's a young man staring at his phone
He don't know what he don't

Chorus:
Well he says "I'm so lost
Not at all well
Well I'm so lost
Not at all"

Outro:
And someday we'll find
That we've been blind
And some blind Messiah
To lead us to the light
Verse 1:
I've been long a long way from here
Put on a poncho played for mosquitoes
And drank til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Chorus:
Well ooh if it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

Verse 2:
We're surrounded by liars yeah but sometimes
We'll tell the truth
Well I've got my books and my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor hiding in my room safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me

Chorus:
Well ooh if it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

Bridge:
So what if right now everything's wrong
We can sing along
And I'll bring you happiness
If it's the last thing I do

Verse 3:
I'll get a dealer a dog and a girlfriend
My own chain reaction oh to put the cat back in the bag
And I'm okay I think as long as I can pretend
That I'm getting better and on the mend
Ah ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Chorus:
Well ooh if it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

Outro:
Ooh if it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad
Verse 1:
It felt like springtime on this February morning
In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

Chorus:
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray that you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away I whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

Verse 2:
I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted 'til you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot barely breathing

Chorus:
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray that you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away I whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

Bridge:
It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

Chorus:
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray that you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away I whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

Outro:
Oh I will wake up happy oh oh oh
I will wake up happy oh oh oh
I will wake up happy oh oh oh
I will wake up happy oh oh oh
Verse 1: MC Lyte
I used to be lover now I'm a fighter
If love was a job then I'd be a writer
If love was a building then I'd be a lighter
That's how I burn the pain keep my flame much brighter
Let's take it back straight up and down rollin' in my '86
Seville it was summertime I was on the
rise tryin' to find my way in the world as a young
woman who had her share of hurtin'
But I knew that I was destined for a better day
Then I started rappin' people started clappin'
Sayin' I was the best in all the land
But I still had my problems I had to understand
That love would never let me down had to keep movin'
Hit after hit song after song
Now I'm a household name and it won't be long

Chorus: Xscape
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on

Verse 2: MC Lyte
Now everybody wanna ask how I went from Ash
To bein' a platinum class lady of rap
First of all let me clear my throat
Got my foot in the door and I ain't goin' for broke
The second time around is always better than the first
Rhymes are like bank accounts they just get worse
Over time but not mine thanks to the Most High
Time after time rhyme after rhyme
And album after album never losin' sight
Of the reason for which God gave me this gift to write
Only he can stop me I'm only goin' where He leads
I'm hittin' pinnacles while most of ya'll just eatin' cheese
In the rat race tryin' to keep the pace
Everybody's just in a rage to be enwaged
And I'm focused on reality no time for chump change
I'd rather be makin' moves than makin' names

Chorus: Xscape
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on

Verse 3: MC Lyte
All we got to do is come together
Tales of a thug or tales of a 'G'
You can't spell the word 'real' without 'Lyte'
The industry is shady and it needs to be taken over
Label to label I'm snatchin' my own weight
My own fate creatin' history in hip-hop
I gotta get props I've traveled so many blocks
And I've seen so many faces
I've hugged so many babies I've been to so many places
I've had so many ups that I've had to make some downs
Maintain my ground do the knowledge look around
And all I see is lowlife sellin' their souls
Find themselves in a crazy hole nothin' to hold
But my rhymes brought me up showed me much love
Made it hard for those who doubt the way I does what I does

Chorus: Xscape
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on don't stop
Keep on keepin' on

Outro: MC Lyte
Yeah just like that y'all
Straight like dat y'all
Verse 1:
I met yr lover 
I saw yr best friend 
I heard yr sister tell her 
'she's just a dead end' 
and I was thinking 
'Why are you sharing this with me' 

Chorus:
Jealousy 
Jealousy 
Jealousy 
Is it a curse or a blessing 

Verse 2:
She says she loves you 
but actions speak louder still 
You know how when things are good 
She's never around 
But when he's breaking 
She's breaking down doors to get in 

Chorus:
Jealousy 
Jealousy 
Jealousy 
Is it a curse or a blessing 

Verse 3:
He's got this temper 
That's something else 
She says she's never seen him 
Take it out on himself 
He'll give his time to you 
As long as it's not much 

Chorus:
Jealousy 
Jealousy 
Jealousy 
Is it a curse or a blessing
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "I Want to Come Over" by Melissa Etheridge:

There's a cool wind blowing down the alley
At 53rd and 3rd
All the salty trash from Seventh Avenue
Is blowing through the leaves
The JV boys are providing
The backbeat to the street
While I'm trying to make some sense
Of what you've done to me

I want to come over to see you
And I want to come over tonight
I want to come over to see you
And I want to come over tonight

We're all tied to the same old fail
That's why I'm trying to get to you
I'm gonna see you
Yes I'm gonna see you
I want to come over
I don't know what I expected
My heart beneath my pride
From love that was unrestricted
To love that was denied
Seems I've been runnin' like a river
Has run to the sea
I've been tryin' to find a heart
That will love me like you used to do

I want to come over to see you
And I want to come over tonight
I want to come over to see you
And I want to come over tonight

We're all tied to the same old fail
That's why I'm trying to get to you
I'm gonna see you
Yes I'm gonna see you
I want to come over

Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm

I keep your picture by my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right
But you left me here alone tonight

And now I want to come over to see you
And I want to come over tonight

We're all tied to the same old fail
That's why I'm trying to get to you
I'm gonna see you
Yes I'm gonna see you
I want to come over
Yes I'm gonna see you
I want to come over
I'm gonna see you
I want to come over
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart

Take back that sad word good-bye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain

Hey this one goes out to all my fellas
Who got that one girl that just drive them crazy
Ya know what I'm sayin'
I'ma tell you 'bout mine say listen


The first time I saw her
She was wearing a sweater
I couldn't take my eyes off her
She was lookin' so much better
She didn't walk like a model
But she still caught my attention
I knew right then and there
I had to make my move before she slipped away


That girl oh oh
She's mine and I love her so
I swear no one can take her away from me
'Cause I love that girl


I had to find a way to tell her
That I was a man of conviction
And if she needed protection
I'd be her superhero her superhero
She didn't give me no play
But I wasn't one to give up easily
I knew right then and there
That I had to make her see that there was more to me


That girl oh oh
She's mine and I love her so
I swear no one can take her away from me
'Cause I love that girl


Listen to me now
Yow Maxi Priest say somethin' for me
Better yet sing somethin' for me


I knew that she was listening
When she started to move a little closer
And when she started whispering
She permanently took me over
I knew right then and there
That my search for love was over
All I know I wanna live my life with her


That girl oh oh
She's mine and I love her so
I swear no one can take her away from me
'Cause I love that girl
So say it Shaggy


Yo listen up man
I met this little girlie her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy all they just say is please me
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme I said "It's not that easy"
'Cause it's a girliez I'm after a girlie a girlie
I just can't get one so I don't wanna get burnt
Wanna see my pictures wanna get my autograph
The letter says "Dear Shaggy I love you very much you signed it"


That girl oh oh Yeah
She's mine and I love her so
I swear no one can take her away from me
'Cause I love that girl yeah Uh-huh
Verse 1: Belo

She got a thang for that money y'all
Could tell by the way she push a Lex
And can't nobody ever tell her shit 
She wear the pants and don't never wanna take 'em off 
If money is the root of all evil
I'm feeling like a rebel 
I'm out here thuggin'
I'm buggin' you ain't gotta know 
I keep it on the low 
Foe she's a POP 
But I'm a soldier 
I thought I told you 
I'm ten years older
Lil' mama sorta grew up fast
When her mama passed 
It happened so sudden 
Ain't no tellin' when she's gon' go 
So the dough that she want 
I'ma give her 
Cause the world ain't nothin' but a bunch of thugs 
And all we do is make cash 

Chorus: Johnny P

I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
She asked me do I love her 
That's a damn shame 
I don't love a goddamn thing

Verse 2: AK-47

I'm a first class flight freak nigga 
That like to have a little somethin' 
On payday I get dressed and hit the avenue 
And catch me a wad or somethin' 
I'm the motherfucking nigga that you heard about 
And if it's bad or good 
I'm the one you gon' hear about 
I'm gettin' my money makin' more money 
And it's alright 'cause I do what I want to 
Fo' life I'm cashin' checks 
And drinkin' Moet 
I'm ridin' a Benz bumpin' Spinnin' Spinnin'
I had tricks from Baghdad all the way to Dayton 
Puttin' it down every motherfuckin' way man 
And all these hoes really wanna pay 
Cause I'm the one that's givin' the cash 
And it's only right to wiggle that ass 
If you want to keep me swervin' 
I'm a nigga that's gon' keep gettin' dough 

Chorus: Johnny P

I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
She asked me do I love her 
That's a damn shame 
I don't love a goddamn thing 

Verse 3: NARD

It's the life that I chose 
To live so I gotta get my cash in stacks 
Gotta have my ninas Glocks and Macs 
Cause ain't nothin' but a gangster party 
And I'm always ready to kill 
When we hit the club 
I'm in the VIP poppin' bottles 
And whatever else they got to spill 
And when we leave it's like a movie 
Cauliflower caviar and champagne 
It's all real when I'm kickin' the game 
No time for love 
Cause there's so much money to make 
We stay fly rollin' around in brand new cars 
Got the hoes at the club we meet 'em at the bar 
And it's the bomb how I put it down 
Givin' love to the honeys on the Chicago South Side 
And I gotta get more 
So I keep jumpin' out here strugglin' 
To live life for me 

Chorus: Johnny P

I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
She asked me do I love her 
That's a damn shame 
I don't love a goddamn thing 

Verse 4: Twista

Twista finna rip it up in the Chi 
And you know I'ma get mine 
Play a few pimp a few 
Plus give head to a hoe or two 
I'm the Chi-town playa 
That likes to mack a little 
Cocoa on a freak 
And get my dick sucked a little 
I put that on my neighborhood 
Pimpin' hoes from State to State 
Givin' all the bitches what they want 
Money clothes and plenty fame 
It's the Chi-Town style 
To keep the party jumpin' 
And all the CD haters 
See a real nigga bumpin' 
You can take me out the hood 
But you can't take the hood from me 
And I'ma be a po pimp 
Til' it's all over 

Chorus: Johnny P

I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
She asked me do I love her 
That's a damn shame 
I don't love a goddamn thing 

Outro: Johnny P

I'm a po' pimp 
I ain't got no goddamn sense 
Sense sense sense 
Po' pimp po' pimp po' pimp 
She asked me do I love her 
That's a damn shame 
I don't love a goddamn thing
Where do I take this pain of mine
I run but it stays right by my side
So tear me open pour me out
These things inside they scream and shout

And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you so hold me

Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you holds you holds you

Until it sleeps yeah
Until it sleeps yeah
Until it sleeps yeah
Until it sleeps yeah
Until it sleeps yeah
Until it sleeps yeah
Until it sleeps yeah
Until it sleeps yeah
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me till I'm clean
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you holds you holds you
Until it sleeps
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Hay" by Crucial Conflict:


Hay
Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay hay hay 


Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay it's Kilo motherfucker
Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay hay hay 


I was born in eighty-three
Started to get hard headed at age of thirteen
Momma kept a nigga clean Dad was on some other shit
Real brotherhood we never had that motherfucker
Kept it cool hangin' with my boys and shit
Dreamin' of big money and mounds of it
Started sellin' dope and nickel bags didn't do shit
So moved on up to what to twenty fives
Had to get with these unorganized niggas to get live
And now I'm clockin' plenty paper for my kids 
Undercover agents they can't fade us
My pockets G'd up and a nigga stayed up
Most of my homies tanked up what
Got caught up shit outta luck
It ain't my fault what just a victim of the game
On the grind tryna make a vain come
It ain't over until it's over a COC thumb
Stayin' down survival 
And if not you liable to be stuck with some rivals
On the East North West South she ch-chow
Cookin' even cookin' at the children's ranch it's like 
Hay


Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay it's Kilo motherfucker
Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay hay hay 


Kilo is the name so I thought you knewed 
Nigga type of kicks that I wear will cost you two
I'ma thoroughbred nigga 
Real nigga too
Got a couple of homies that'll murder for my crew pow
So don't make us have to hurt ya ahww
Puttin' a nigga up under the dirt pfft
You suckers and you phonies can't stand me 
Cream color Bronco got'em sayin' goddamn uhh
This nigga so of the hook 
Got niggas sellin' pooters tryna get on my books 
And I ain't even got a record deal 
That's why your little sister wanna give me head for real 
Been killin' em' with the flow from day number one 
And keepin' it mo' real  then sayin' I'm datin' someone
But we can do this shit the easy way 
Or we can do this shit the Kilo way ayy
But I suggest you think a lot 
If you don't want to get hot 
Start runnin' like a fuckin' idiot cookin' up 
Hay hay hay hay


Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay it's Kilo motherfucker
Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay hay hay 


I'ma soldia' clockin' G's at a young age
Fresh Prince Nick of Time I turn the page
I'm swingin' 
Didn't hit my nuts still hangin' 
And my accomplice smuggled 
Hatch packin' a double 
A walk-through and my team 
Niggas no scrubs like TLC 
All too real all in kid 
Spendin' like three dollars 
Readin' up on Hip Hop Weekly 
Seen her like baby girl 
I'm headin' out the worlds 
I'm sick in the mind 
Like George Wallace 
These niggas playin' head games 
While I set up shop 
And they ploppin' on my head 
Real life comes with the game 
While I'm stackin' my bread 
Niggas talkin' tellin' lies 
I'm just tellin' the truth 
Ask me anything on how to 
Get in the game 
It's all up to you 
Nigga swallow your pride 
Or get ready to die 
Still hittin' figures sippin' Crown 
Of course it's goin' down 
While I'm


Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay it's Kilo motherfucker
Hay hay hay hay
Hay hay hay hay

Hope that helps

I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back want you back I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back want you back I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined I figured out this story
It wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me

Whatever I said whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back want you back I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back want you back I want you back for good

And we'll be together
This time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back want you back I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back want you back I want you back for good

I want you back for good
Want you back want you back I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back want you back I want you back for good
"AhhOoh

My nails are bitin'
My palms are sweating
And I'm freaking

I'm picking at myself again
I'm picking at myself again
I'm pickin' at myself again

I got Id
But I'm not an Idiot
Got no family

I don't feel the pain
I don't look back
I don't feel anything
And now I'm nailed down

Outta reach from me to you
Always something in my way
I'm pickin' at myself again
I'm pickin' at myself again

Don't feel the pain
I don't need to so
Why are you screaming
I'm locked in my cave
Outta reach from me to you
Always something in my way
I'm pickin' at myself again
I'm pickin' at myself again
I'm pickin' at myself again
I'm pickin' at myself again

Long road long time
Wound up nothin' tongue-tied and tired
I can't keep hanging on
To what I know
And what I'm dearly sorry
I'm not the man
To wax
To rhyme
To wax
To rhyme
To yield
Wound up faced down
I can't keep straight
And faced up
Nothin' but emptiness
I'm turning Inside outI'm turning inside out
I'm turning inside out"

Hey yeah ya know what

I like the players
No diggity no doubt uh
Play on play that
Play on play that

Yo Dre drop the verse

It's going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB collab' creations
Bump like acne no doubt
I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
Attractin' honeys like a magnet
Givin' em ear-gasms with my mellow accent
Still movin' his flavor with the homeys Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down good Lord
Baby got em open all over town
Strickly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds gettin' paid by the pound
Gettin' laid is a forte
Each and every day true playa way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stackin' up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
It's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect ten I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity I got to bag it up bag it up

She's got class and style
Street-knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching villians is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words spin's the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day every day
You're blowin' my mind maybe in time
Baby I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity I got to bag it up bag it up

Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Damn that girl looks good
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Play on play on playa

Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
You're my kind of girl no diggity
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Play on play on playa

'Cause she's a fly girl
And I'm a fly guy
All I want is a chicken wing with a side o' collard greens
Hey ooh baby hey ooh baby hey ooh baby hey ooh baby repeat

Hey love
You say you need someone
To be there for you
To love you all night long huh
It’s kinda funny but I don’t think you have to look no further
Because I’m right here
And I’m ready
To do all the things your man won’t do


Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold
Treat you like you’re nothin’
When you’re worth more than gold
Girl to me you’re like a diamond
I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I’d give the world to make you mine


Just let me inside baby
And I’ll make you feel so good
I’ll caress your body
And kiss your lips
Make you scream and shout
Come on let me love you
From the bottom of your feet to the top of your head
I’ll be right there baby
You don’t have to look no further
Because I’m ready to do all the things your man won’t do


Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold
Treat you like you’re nothin’
When you’re worth more than gold
Girl to me you’re like a diamond
I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I’d give the world to make you mine


If you wanna know I’ll do it
If you wanna know I’ll do it
I will do all the things I will do it for you
All the things your man won’t do I’ll do it for you
I’ll do it for you I’ll do it for you
I’ll do it for you I’ll do it for you


Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold
Treat you like you’re nothin’
When you’re worth more than gold
Girl to me you’re like a diamond
I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I’d give the world to make you mine


I’ll do it I’ll do it I’ll do it I’ll do it
I will do all the things I’ll do it I’ll do it I’ll do it
All the things your man won’t do

Uh-huh uh uh-huh who do you love
Tell me who do you love


Sleepless nights losing ground
I'm reaching for you you're not around
I call your name mmm and I'm alone
I'm in a daze the fact is gone


And the nights grow colder
Lonely together holding each other
I am not enough mmm
Loving you is so tough


Who do you love is it me or her
Who do you love now I'm not so sure
I die every time we spend time apart
Tell me who do you love who do you love


Taste my tears taste my pain
Why can't we go back to your games
All my life it's just been me
Now I find I'm losing key


And the nights grow colder
Lonely together holding each other
I am not enough mmm
Loving you is so tough


Who do you love is it me or her
Who do you love now I'm not so sure
I die every time we spend time apart
Tell me who do you love who do you love
Verse 1:
Why-y-y you always kickin' dirt
You never clean up your mess
How much-how much is it really worth
Your weight in gold I guess

Pre-Chorus:
What's it gonna take for you to know
That you can't keep hurting me so

Chorus:
I'm gonna set you free oh-whoa-oh

Verse 2:
Why-y-y you always hanging on
You oughta let me be
What's so good about a sad song
It's only misery

Pre-Chorus:
What's it gonna take for you to know
That you can't keep hurting me so

Chorus:
I'm gonna set you free oh-whoa-oh

Bridge:

To the beat of my own drum
I'm gonna keep on shining
Like a rising sun

Chorus:

Verse 1: The Notorious BIG

Verse 3: Junior MAFIA
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle another day another struggle
I know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Selling drugs to all the losers
Mad Buddha abuser but they don't know about your stress-filled days
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't living so devilish
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew flipping over 62's
Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G I got P-A-I-D
That's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
GLOCK nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment he wasn't trying to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court for an assault
That I caught in Bridgeport New York
Catch me if you can like the gingerbread man
You better have your gat in hand cause man

Chorus: The Notorious BIG sung
Take money take money
Money money take money
Verse 1:
Your love is wonderful yeah

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Mouth" by Merril Bainbridge:

You've got a beautiful mouth
To kiss me goodnight
And keep me warm all over
It's a beautiful mouth
To tell me those lies
That I love to believe over

And over and over and over

You've got a beautiful mouth
I'm addicted to
And I can't live without it
It's a beautiful mouth
That sings me to sleep
With a voice I want to shout my love to

And over and over and over

Bridge
Oh darling can't you see
You're getting the best of me
And all I wanna do is
Stay right here with you

Chorus
And when you look at me
With those eyes so fine
I melt inside
And I know that I'm yours
I confess to you
I'm addicted to your beautiful mouth

You've got a beautiful mouth
That leads me astray
And always takes me over
It's a beautiful mouth
That makes me feel so alive
And I never want to be sober

And over and over and over

Bridge
Chorus x2

You've got a beautiful mouth
It's a beautiful mouth
It's a beautiful mouth

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "How Do U Want It" by 2Pac featuring K-Ci and JoJo:


How do you want it
How do you feel
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane I'm for real


How do you want it
How do you feel
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane I'm for real


Love the way she agrin' probably love the way it goes
Only been in Cali for a month or so
But that's enough for me to want to leave
Done seen it all when it's done to me
Now homie wants to see if I'm really hard
Step up and I'll give you my regard
Talk the talk and then he try to walk the walk
Let me ride see if you still talk the talk
I'm 'bout to have a triple baby in the backseat
Askin' me what I'm feelin' I'm tryin' to live free
I'm goin' places where I've never been
Seen money and the cars the diamond rings
Realized nothing's changed still the same mothafucka
That stepped up on the scene '94 waitin' on the green
Still gotta get mine in a big black truck
Ready to bust on them niggas that trip
I really mean it the ultimate test ended with the dick
But can you picture me when I'm cold
Young nigga gettin' paper gettin' old
Can you feel me Was a good nigga gone bad
But I kept my head strong prayed and showed my back


How do you want it
How do you feel
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane I'm for real
How do you want it
How do you feel
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane I'm for real


Tell me is it cool to fuck
Do you think I come to talk amuck
Laid back and learn in the cut
D-p with my gat don't scrap
I'll just take it out let it spill
Low-ass nigga end up killin' him and I'll be a killer
B's up legs down let the system test
Is there a way for me to come up blessed
Join me edible ten millimeter change your fate
I'm gettin' bodied up pack heat like I'm 'Lego'
To the Yugoslavs much love
Got caught with a strap and they send me back to 10-8
I'm in the cell with Lil' Shorty 'Lo my nigga Boco
From Louisiana keepin' five thangs smokin'
That's my nigga that put me on to the yard
When the Lord caught me off guard
Forgive me Lord but I wonder how I'm ended with me dyin'
Plus it's expected one day I'll be facing eternal fire
I'm on my knees beggin' please come and save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy
I got my eyes on with crooked out shit
I'm just a hopeless thug trapped up in this ghetto life
I'm tryin' to win but steady losin' with every step I take
It's like a war and nobody can hear me pray
If I die tonight will it be a fair fight
Promise me you'll remember me as a nigga straight thuggin'
Hey


How do you want it
How do you feel
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane I'm for real
How do you want it
How do you feel
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane I'm for real

And here are the uncensored lyrics for "California Love" by 2Pac featuring Dr Dre and Roger Troutman:


California love
California
With a new style of funk


Fresh outta 'matic I'm automatic
Money money stackin' Mackin' hoe crackin'
Drinkin' bottles at the club and nigga you ain't gettin' in
We bustin' screamin' wet 'bout to be a barber
And I got a gun that's cool with the powder
And some funky expedition to get my quota
In a big body Benz servin' 10 outta 10
Me and my homies hopped outta the back and 10
We start jostlin' loot and everything's cool
The vibe and vibe is vibin' it's all motherfuckin' fool
I'm lighted up with the bomb
I'll blow your ass up fuck makin' songs
I'm creepin' while you're sleepin'
Nothin' always happens when the Fugees try to creep in
I got the motherfuckin' cops chasing me
But I'm Northbound on the 110 freeway


California love
California
The new style of funk
California
California love
California

Now let me welcome everybody to the wild wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you'll never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I've been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin' lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Soon as I stepped on the scene I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol the life of a Westside playa
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In LA we wearin' Chucks not Ballys yeah that's right
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous because we program worldwide

Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam it's Westside
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
