Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feelin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handin' you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we havin' fun yet"
Yeah yeah yeah no no no
Yeah yeah yeah no no
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you
And this is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handin' you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream "Are we havin' fun yet"
Yeah yeah yeah no no no
Yeah yeah yeah no no
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'

Hot in Herre by Nelly:


It's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off


Uh it's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
And I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off
Uh it's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
And I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off


It's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off


Why you at the bar if you ain't popping the bottles
What good is all the fame if you ain't fucking the models
I see you driving sports cars ain't hitting the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred top down and goggles
Get off the freeway exit one-ten Pacific Coast
I'll see you at the show tonight lil' wizzy gonna flow
I'll ride with you I'm in a Porsche too
I don't wanna do nothing to contribute to an abortion suit
I'll take you to the top of the globe let's stop playing
Big house long hallways got ten bathrooms I can play
Dope game champagne bottle after bottle it's on
And we gon’ drink until every bubble in every bottle is gone


It's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off


Nelly baby I'm likin' what I see
Wide hips and big ol' titties
The girl a donkey I'm a fan of the kiddies
Hit me up when you need D baby all sizes


It's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here so hot so take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off

I love you and I need you
Nelly I love you I do neeeeed you -
but


No matter what I do all I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo boy you know I'm crazy over you
No matter what I do all I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo boy you know I'm crazy over you


I love you and I need you
Nelly I love you I do neeeeed you -
but


I want you to know I'm serious 'bout us - I want to make it clear
That I'm the one for you - and I ain't afraid to let it show
I want to tell you how I feel how I feel
And let you know that my love is real my love is real
I'll be faithful faithful I'm for real for real
And with us you'll always know the deal the deal


I love you and I need you
Nelly I love you I do neeeeed you -

No more lookin' - l'ma be your Clyde you can be my Bonnie
And I'll be your Clyde and you can be my Bonnie
And I'll be your shade-tree you'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your Louisiana you can be my southern belle
Just like that movie you know the one with Bogie and Bacall
This love gon' be classic like that movie sorry compare nobody
Thoughts of a Goodfella me and my wise guy
And that's why


I love you and I need you
Nelly I love you I do neeeeed you -
but
So lately been wondering 
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face 
If a great wave should fall and fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone could you make it on your own
If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go 
And maybe I'll find out 
A way to make it back someday 
To watch you to guide you through the darkest of your days 
If a great wave should fall and fall upon us all 
Then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you 
If I could then I would 
I'll go wherever you will go 
Way up high or down low 
I'll go wherever you will go
Run away with my heart 
Run away with my hope 
Run away with my love 
I know now just quite how 
My life and love might still go on 
In your heart and your mind 
I'll stay with you for all of time 
If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go 
Way up high or down low 
I'll go wherever you will go 
If I could turn back time 
I'll go wherever you will go 
If I could make you mine 
I'll go wherever you will go
Making my way downtown
Walking fast faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these when I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by
Oh 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I I don't wanna let you know
I I drown in your memory
I I don't wanna let this go
I I don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight
It is important to note that the lyrics contain profanity and mature themes

  
It starts with  
One thing I don’t know why  
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme  
To explain in due time  

  
All I know  
Time is a valuable thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the day  
The clock ticks life away it’s so unreal  

  
Didn’t look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on but you didn’t even know  
Wasted it all just to watch you go  

  
All I know  
Time is a valuable thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the day  
The clock ticks life away it’s so unreal  

  
But in the end it doesn’t even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end it doesn’t even matter  

  
One thing I don’t know why  
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself how I tried so hard  

  
All I know  
Time is a valuable thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the day  
The clock ticks life away it’s so unreal  

  
But in the end it doesn’t even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all  
But in the end it doesn’t even matter  

  
I’ve put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I can go  
For all this  
There’s only one thing you should know  
I’ve put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I can go  
For all this  
There’s only one thing you should know

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who
Makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past
You wanna let it go


I've been there done it fucked around
After all that this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby


You got you got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
You got you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else


I've been there done it fucked around
After all that this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby


Now you're all up in the mix
And you're wanting some fixed
And all you gotta do is get in to her head
Uh talk to her
And when you find yourself lying late at night
Just think of her and it'll be alright
Take it slow oh ohh

Your body's callin' got me feelin' like For ya
Got me thinkin' 'bout the things you do you
I feel so foolish oh oh oh
For what you've done for me
You got me goin' crazy
I'm feelin' for you baby


I've been there I've been there done it done it fucked around
After all that all that this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you've got it bad you've got it bad ohh


If you're on the outside ohh
You're thinking you're in love you're thinking you're in love
But you're really not
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahhhhh
Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied without you I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us but that's not very far

Can you take it all away can you take it all away
When you shoved it in my face this pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away can you take it all away
When you shoved it in my face this pain you gave to me

You you're my mask you're my cover my shelter
You you're my mask you're the one who's blamed

Do you wonder why I'm torn
Do you see the blood I shed
Do you wonder why I'm dead

When you shoved it in my face this pain you gave to me

'Cause life's like this

Chill out whatcha yellin' for
Lay back it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see

I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one on one
But you become
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back
Like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated
I see the way you're actin' like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
You fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honesty promise me
I'm never gonna find you fake it
No no no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at
You see you're makin' me laugh out
When you strike a pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know you're not foolin' anyone
When you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back
Like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated
I see the way you're actin' like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated

Sure below are the uncensored lyrics of "Ain't It Funny Murder Remix" by Jennifer Lopez featuring Ja Rule:


Murda Inc
Got you lovin' this shit
Game and Ashanti


It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I wanna be
You're what I wanna be


So how can you look me in the face
And turn away from me
So why
Girl ain't it funny
How a simple conversation
Made me think about you
Made me think about you


Ain't it funny
How a simple conversation
Made me think about you
Ain't it funny
How I'm twisted in your hands
Bridge: Jennifer Lopez
And you're taking me to
The best place in the universe
Feels so good now
Feels so unreal
Ain't it funny


Yeah yeah
It's Murder Inc mami
You know how we do it
I got you Lo


Baby you gotta get up on this
Ha ha it's Murda
She wrote:


Why would she write such a thing
And why would she lie about the life that she's been given
Why would she write that
I'll wait a while
For the moment
To write my ending
The beauty of life

Ain't it funny
How a simple conversation
Made me think about you
Ain't it funny
How I'm twisted in your hands

And you're taking me to
The best place in the universe
Feels so good now
Feels so unreal
Ain't it funny


Ain't it funny
How a simple conversation
Made me think about you
Ain't it funny
How I'm twisted in your hands

And you're taking me to
The best place in the universe
Feels so good now
Feels so unreal
Ain't it funny
Verse 1: 
Hey don't write yourself off yet 
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on 
Just try your best try everything you can 
And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away 

Chorus: 
It just takes some time little girl you're in the middle of the ride 
Everything everything will be just fine 
Everything everything will be all right all right 

Verse 2:
Hey you know they're all the same 
You know you're doing better on your own so don't buy in 
Live right now yeah just be yourself 
It doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else 

Chorus: 
It just takes some time little girl you're in the middle of the ride 
Everything everything will be just fine 
Everything everything will be all right all right 

Bridge: 
Hey don't write yourself off yet 
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on 
Just do your best do everything you can 
And don't you worry what the bitter hearts are gonna say 

Chorus: 
It just takes some time little girl you're in the middle of the ride 
Everything everything will be just fine 
Everything everything will be all right all right 

Outro: 
Hey don't write yourself off yet 
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on 
Just do your best do everything you can 
And don't you worry what the bitter hearts are gonna say
Yeah c'mon
I need a girl yeah yeah
I need a girl to ride ride ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone never spend the night alone
I got a few you would like to bone but chicks don't romance me don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany Nancy that's not enough for me
Every ghetto needs a Diddy need a Mase back to the hood but to be embraced by the ghetto
Girl you get the dildo Cause I love my free time you kiss me when you see me and hug me when you greet me
Not the one you cheat with comes with a receipt
And for you a website that's just a little slight

1 - I need a girl to ride ride ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life


Hey yo now let me state it relationship's are overrated
I know you're mad frustrated with the bullshit I'm just saying
Instead of hating girlfriend just give thanks
It's time to elevate cause real love's hard to find you got lucky too many times
When true love you let it go oh oh oh


Yo yo it's like monopoly ain't it obvious
I'm the one that's got the properties
And she's the one that's always stopping me
It's loon from the block what'd you expect from me
Take a seat listen up it's not complicated
Got rhymes for the laydees plus the mind to innovate it
Now who's the realist punani's feel this
His money he bill this and all it took was dilligence
Better show me the girl cause all I need is a boo
I'll let you know the deal I keep it realer than most
I know you feelin' it baby I know you need me oh no
No need to be greedy

Repeat 1


Every minute there's a new start
And a brand new love and I know that's what you want
Girl that's what you need
So why you holding back now baby
Why can't you just be real with me
I need a girl a girl who's gonna ride for me
I need a girl a girl who's gonna make it alright
I need a girl a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Repeat 1 until fade

Verse 1:
See it's perfect timing
You see the stars shining
Just know that my love
Is perfect for ya girl

You hit me on my cellphone
You're in your feelings girl ain't ya
I'm driving while I'm tripping
On my coffee bean just need ya
I'm swerving lanes no kidding
My love for you is real girl
I miss you and I want to hold ya
I miss the way that you breathe girl

Pre-chorus:
I don't even know your name
But I'm feeling your energy
I've never felt the same
About somebody that I barely know
But I gotta get in touch with you
'Cause you remind me of something

Chorus:
I don't have to call I don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'mma be alright tonight
You don't have to call no more
Baby I'mma be alright you don't have to call


Verse 2:
It's been three days and I'm still hurting
I don't know what to do
I guess it's time to let it go
How did this happen I don't know
But I'm not gonna lose my cool
I'm sure there's someone that's right for you oh

Pre-chorus:
I don't even know your name
But I'm feeling your energy
I've never felt the same
About somebody that I barely know
But I gotta get in touch with you
'Cause you remind me of something

Chorus:
I don't have to call I don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'mma be alright tonight
You don't have to call no more

I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine

And I'mma do it again wanna be more than friends
Yo if you're a ten if you're a five nope it don't matter
'Cause I got long dough I'll play the high and the low
And I got a cold flow that make a young girl's blood boil
Let alone a hot one it'll make her wanna spoil me
LOON is the name that'll never be played
Like them other cats that's in the game that'll never be made
I need a girl that could stand me  raise me a family
Go from trips to Delanceys to trips to the Grammy's
'Cause most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe it's the money or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause life could be moving too fast I'll give you security I'm talking 'bout

And when we meet I'm guaranteed ecstasy

Hello Please find below the full uncensored lyrics of "My Sacrifice" by Creed:

Hello my friend we meet again
It's been awhile where should we begin
Feels like forever
Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me
Oh I remember

When you are with me I'm free
I'm careless I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there

When you are with me I'm free
I'm careless I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

When you are with me I'm free
I'm careless I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
Cause when you are with me I am free
I'm careless I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
My sacrifice
Verse 1:
Obie Trice real name no gimmicks
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside 'round the outside

Verse 2:
Guess who's back back again
Shady's back tell a friend
Guess who's back guess who's back
Guess who's back guess who's back
Guess who's back guess who's back
Guess who's back

Verse 3:
I've created a monster 'cause nobody wants to see
Marshall no more they want Shady I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating

Verse 4:
I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Verse 5:
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

Verse 6:
It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally
For you so I could come back a brand new me
You helped see me through and don't even realize what you did
Believe me you I've been through the ringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead no more beef flingers
No more drama from now on I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof
Like my daughters and raise it you couldn't lift a single shingle on it


Outro:
'Cause the way I feel I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raising the bar I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars I feel amazing
And I'm not afraid I'm not afraid to take a stand
To take a stand yeah it's been a ride
Everybody everybody I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Come take my hand come take my hand now some of you might still be in that place
We'll walk this road together through the storm
Whatever weather cold or warm c'mon
If you're like that just let me know

Let me find the uncensored lyrics of "Hero" by Enrique Iglesias for you


Would you dance
If I asked you to dance
Would you run
And never look back
Would you cry
If you saw me crying
And would you save my soul tonight


Would you tremble
If I touched your lips
Would you laugh
Oh please tell me this
Now would you die
For the one you love
Oh hold me in your arms tonight


I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away


Would you swear
That you'll always be mine
Or would you lie
Would you run and hide
Am I in too deep
Have I lost my mind
Well I don't care 'cause you're here tonight


I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away


Oh I just wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you oh yeah
Am I in too deep
Have I lost my mind
Well I don't care 'cause you're here tonight


I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by your forever
You can take my breath away


I can be your hero
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away
Verse 1:
I wanted to be like you
I wanted everything
So I tried to be like you
And I got swept away

I didn't know that it was so cold
And you needed someone to show you the way

So I took your hand and we figured out
That when the tide comes I'd take you away

Chorus:
If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

Verse 2:
I'm sinking slowly
So hurry hold me
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on

Please can you tell me
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone

Chorus:
If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

Verse 3:
It's not a miracle we needed
And no I wouldn't let you think so
Fallen out of love
Falling for you
Finally found a love that is true

Chorus:
If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

Outro:
If you need me you know I'll be there
Oh yeah oh yeah
If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
I'll try my best however please note that the lyrics may contain explicit language: 

I am so high I can hear heaven
I am so high I can hear heaven
Whoa but heaven no heaven don't hear me
And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away
Someone told me that love would all save us
But how can that be look what love gave us
A world full of killing and blood-spilling
That world never came
And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away
Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do
And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away
And they're watching us they're watching us
As we all fly away
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics:

You're indecisive when it comes to making any plans
You're on the fence
You give me reasons I never seem to understand
They don't make sense
Maybe I'm crazy or maybe you're just a liar
Maybe you're just a sucker for that feeling that you're right where you belong

Wasting my time in the waiting line
Do you believe in what you see
Nine to five it's the same routine
A habit that sticks
You're masquerading it's a long parade
You're in the crowd but you're so alone
What's the problem can't you articulate
Are you tongue-tied or are you weak-kneed

I see you on the street and you walk on by
You're in the line staring not to blink
You go through life so fast
You just might miss it
When you're here today gone tomorrow

Wasting my time in the waiting line
Do you believe in what you see
Nine to five it's the same routine
A habit that sticks
You're masquerading it's a long parade
You're in the crowd but you're so alone
What's the problem can't you articulate
Are you tongue-tied or are you weak-kneed

You get what you deserve and not what you need
When you're taken for granted
And you're out of belief
And you don't know what's right
You don't know what's wrong

Wasting my time in the waiting line
Do you believe in what you see
Nine to five it's the same routine
A habit that sticks
You're masquerading it's a long parade
You're in the crowd but you're so alone
What's the problem can't you articulate
Are you tongue-tied or are you weak-kneed
Please note that some listeners may find the lyrics of this song to be explicit and it may not be suitable for all audiences Here are the uncensored lyrics to "One Last Breath" by Creed:

Please come now I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape

I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace

I cried out Heaven save me
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's something left for me
So please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's something left

Look at me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Hmm maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Hmm maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace

I cried out Heaven save me
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down
Lucky you the uncensored lyrics of "Whenever Wherever" by Shakira are as follows:

Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence

Baby I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

Le ro lo le lo le
Le ro lo le lo le

Can't you see
I'm at your feet
Whenever wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear

Thereover hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains

Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

Le ro lo le lo le
Le ro lo le lo le

At your feet
I'm at your feet
Whenever wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear

Thereover hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear

Le ro lo le lo le
Le ro lo le lo le

Think out loud say it again
Le ro lo le lo le lo le
Tell me one more time
That you'll live
Lost in my eyes

Whenever wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear

Thereover hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel

Tell me tell me baby
Verse 1:
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the US nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin' pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear "Come to the picture booth
So I could ask you some questions to see if you're a hundred proof"
I asked her her name she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said "How do you like the show" she said "I was very amused"
I started throwin' bass she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked "Do ya have a man" she tried to pretend
She said "No I don't I only have a friend"

Chorus:
Come on I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing
Youuuuuuuu you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend oh baby
Youuuuuuuu you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend oh baby

Verse 2:
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes Agatha Germaine and Jack
Forget about that let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin' getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room a guy picked up and then I called again
I said "Yo who was that" "Oh he's just a friend"

Chorus:
Come on I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing
Youuuuuuuu you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend oh baby
Youuuuuuuu you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend oh baby

Verse 3:
Wasn't born last night I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowin' up her pager last night
But she ain't havin' none of that she says I'm her only
She's got a man but he's always playin' her
I'm the one that she wants to be with uh
If he don't act right she'll be callin' my phone
It seems like he's sportin' that Pelle Pelle
I thought I was the one that gave her enough
When she got dumped disrespectful and foul
I just shook my head like "What the heck now"
I'm not a hater like you tryin' to front
I thought her and I had somethin' in common
I laid all my cards then she said "Blow it"
And I didn't know what to do but I said "Forget it"
And I'm a leave it alone but I had to write a song

Chorus:
Come on I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing
Youuuuuuuu you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend oh baby
Youuuuuuuu you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend oh baby

Outro:
You you got what I need x2
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need x2
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need x4
My friend the communist holds meetings in his RV
I can't afford his gas so I'm stuck here watching TV
I don't have digital I don't have diddly squat
It's not having what you want it's wanting what you've got

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone to lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun

I'm gonna soak up the sun

I've got a crummy job it don't pay near enough
To buy the things it takes to win me some of your love
Every time I turn around I'm looking up you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you that makes you act the way you do

I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone to lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun

While it's still free I'm gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me

Don't have no master suite I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride but baby I'm the one who has the key
Every time I turn around I'm looking up you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you that makes you act the way you do

Maybe I am crazy too
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone to lighten up
I'm gonna tell 'em that I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun

I got my 45 on so I can rock on
Typical girls with typical lives  
I try to be original  
Got picked on a lot in high school  
But that made me stronger  
That made me who I am today  

Picked on for being a "loser"  
A loner a "lower"  
What's the point of trying to fit in  
I can't win I can't win  
And sometimes I'd feel more comfortable  
In my own skin  

Sometimes I wish I was someone else  
Sometimes I wish I was anyone but me  
I'd rather be a star a self-absorbed superstar  
Than have to be who I am  
But you see I'm not a singer or a poet  
Or a genius or mathematician  
I'm just me me  
And that's all I can be  

Don't let me get me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you annoy yourself  
So irritating  
Don't wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  

Sometimes I wanna be somebody  
Sometimes I wanna be somebody else  
Sometimes I wanna be somebody  
Sometimes I wanna be somebody else  

I never win first place I don't support the team  
I can't take direction and my socks are never clean  
Teachers dated me mother hated me  
I was always in a fight 'cause I can't do nothin' right  
Everyday I fight a war against the mirror  
I can't take the person starin' back at me  
I'm a hazard to myself  

Don't let me get me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you annoy yourself  
So irritating  
Don't wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  

Don't let me get me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you annoy yourself  
So irritating  
Don't wanna be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else

Verse 1:
I was at the mall sipping on a milkshake
Playin' the wall takin' a break
A pretty little thing approached me with a wink
As I shook my head she said "Come on let's think"
Got in the car and started to figure it out
You wanna taste of what I've got then take a look but don't touch
Hmm Is what I said to her
In good conversation hit me up with "Oops"


Oops oh my gotta keep on keepin' on
Oops oh my gotta keep on keepin' on
Oops oh my gotta keep on keepin' on
Oops oh my gotta keep on keepin' on


Oops there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my oops there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my oops some kind of touch caressing my legs
Oh my oops I'm turning red who could this be

Oh oh silly me that's just my professor

You know he used to stroke me
When I was in English class
And I would flirt with him yeah
Just to get an "A"
He would give me hugs and stuff
Rubs on my back and stuff
I knew exactly what he wanted
But I didn't care 'cause I wanted him too

I heard y'all two stop it finish the story

He touched my mind and I screamed "Oh"
Made me feel like a school girl
He was my professor and all I was just a nother
Took me by surprise when he gave me a hug
But I still remember the way that he rubbed me

Stop hold up hold up slow down slow down
Hey don't fool with that that's mine
Stop stop it come here come here

I'm not just teasing I'm giving you a reason
To be my love and satisfy my needs
Ooh why do I feel this way
Things about to go down
I'm really goin' crazy now
No kiddin' oh my god
Oops Ha yeah I know I know
Repeat Chorus x2


Oops there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my oops there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my oops some kind of touch caressing my legs
Oh my oops I'm turning red who could this be
They see me red they think I'm freaky
Who am I to disagree
Verse 1:
What if I told you it was all meant to be
Would you believe me would you agree
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy

Verse 2:
When I tell you love has come here and now
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Chorus:
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me

Verse 3:
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender I can't explain

"Welcome to the real world" she said to me  
Condescendingly  
Take a seat  
Take your life  
Plot it out in black and white  
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings  
And the drama queens  
I'd like to think the best of me  
Is still hiding  
Up my sleeve  

They love to tell you  
Stay inside the lines  
But something's better  
On the other side  
I wanna run through the halls of my high school  
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs  
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world  
Just a lie you've got to rise above  

So the good boys and girls take the so-called right track  
Faded white hats  
Grabbing credits  
And maybe transfers  
They read all the books but they can't find the answer  

And all of our parents  
They're getting older  
I wonder if they've wished for anything better  
While in their memories  
Tiny tragedies  

They love to tell you  
Stay inside the lines  
But something's better  
On the other side  
I wanna run through the halls of my high school  
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs  
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world  
Just a lie you've got to rise above  

I am invincible  
As long as I'm alive  

I wanna run through the halls of my high school  
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs  
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world  
Just a lie you've got to rise above  
I just can't wait til my 10 year reunion  
I'm gonna bust down the double doors  
And when I stand on these tables before you  
You will know what all this time was for"
Run just as fast as I can  
To the middle of nowhere  
To the middle of my frustrated fears  
And I swear you're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you keep makin' me ill  

You keep makin' me ill  

I haven't moved from the spot where you left me  
This must be a bad trip  
All of the other pills they were different  
Maybe I should get some help  

You make me so upset that I'm hopeless  
Oh there's nothin' left of me  
So don't strike me I'm just playin' possum  
I'm gonna lie right here and soak up the sun  
Gonna tell everyone to lighten up  

I'm spacin' out because you're makin' me all bent  
Nothin's makin' sense  

You're makin' me laugh out of control  
And seriously not right  

So don't strike me I'm just playin' possum  
I'm gonna lie right here and soak up the sun  
Gonna tell everyone to lighten up  

I'm spacin' out because you're makin' me all bent  
Nothin's makin' sense  

You're makin' me laugh out of control  
And seriously not right  

Nothing's makin' sense  
Nothing's makin' sense  
Nothing's makin' sense  
Nothing's makin' sense  

You're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you're makin' me ill  
You're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you're makin' me ill  

You're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you're makin' me ill  
You're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you're makin' me ill  

Nothing's makin' sense  
Nothing's makin' sense  
Nothing's makin' sense  
Nothing's makin' sense  

You're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you're makin' me ill  
You're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you're makin' me ill  
You're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you're makin' me ill  
You're just like a pill  
Instead of makin' me better you're makin' me ill

So rough gettin' into shit been tryna dig her
Get up off this pretty little somethin'
Bouncing on 20-somethin's
Gangsta cause ain't nothin' weak
Street niggas steel sharp just the grammar
Lil' world I'm still here just looking for love
It's a thin line between the one's that's for her 
And the one's that's caught a buzz
2 6's mommy's little helper grew up to be a stunner it's murder
I'm guilty for takin' her from a world 
I'm try'na protect her from 
But can't give her up


Wanna be down for you

Love is love


Baby I brought you in on this
Part of the game
And we nothin' but animals but 
We different main
Got somethin' to say uh huh
Takin' trips to PR's
Vita and Charlie both keeps it gangsta en mi cama
And to the sofa fuckin' real wild 
Providing our own fantasies we fulfill
Let me take you to a place where miss  
Don't exist and only ecstasy resides
And let me guide you slowly but surely 
To where the fuckin' grimey niggas and the stunners collide
Huh uh I'm no longer hungry 
I'm finally full but these cats try to clip our wings
We're bulletproof they're usin' lames 
To shoot game cause they don't want no part of these Brooklyn dames
And if you hear a nigga creeping up on you 
You better bust that nigga let's go
Hundred percent kills everytime 
We touch that nigga uh


Wanna be down for you
Said I wanna be down
I wanna be your chick
I wanna be down for you
Do you trust me
Yeah
Love is love


Ooh your chick
I let her in my booth
She told me 'bout your plans to creep and skip town 
With your jewels
While you in your car crash and you're burned to death 
Cause you knew about this F-U-N
But you wasn't concerned you and Ja Rule
Started slippin' not to mention 
Trips to Wisconsin
Might as well have asked the bitch straight up to be talkin'


Lately you've been stressin' me
And claimin' that I'm Mese
Need I remind you that chick you with 
Wasn't sprung for me
I'm usually game then I flip 
6 o'clock daylight it's just me and my true thugs 
Who's down to die and catch a case for me
If that's the case baby 
We can take a vacay have a high speed 
Gun wit my chicks in LA word up
Cuz ain't shit changed since the last time 
And if we're lost let's pray to God that the clips empty
We'll handle it like men Ja and ED


Wanna be down for you
Said I wanna be down
I wanna be your chick
I wanna be down for you
Do you trust me

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Superman It's Not Easy" by Five for Fighting:

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

I'm more than a bird
I'm more than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face
Beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

Wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd but don't be naïve
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed but won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up up and away away from me
It's all right you can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naïve
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me

Inside of me inside of me yeah
Inside of me inside of me

I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man looking for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy hmmm hmmm hmmm
Where's my snare I have no snare in my headphones
There you go yeah yo' yo'

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against
I have I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keeps kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evening
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me but they never figure me out
Look at me now I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet ha
I said I'm sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

Ha I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'

I'm sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet ha
I said I'm sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me ma
So you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
But guess what you're gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now you should see her she's beautiful
But you'll never see her she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
Well guess what I am dead dead to you as can be

I'm sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet ha
I said I'm sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

I'm sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet ha
I said I'm sorry mama I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Halfcrazy" by Musiq Soulchild:


I'm tired of the many fights we have
I'm tired of always apologizing for causing them
I'm tired of always trying to make it worth your while
I'm tired of always trying to make it right
I'm tired of trying to make you happy
I'm tired of always giving my all
I'm tired baby oh I'm tired


'Cause I'm half crazy feeling sorry for myself
But I can't keep going on like this
It's time to get off this shelf
'Cause I'm half crazy feeling sorry for myself
But I can't keep going on like this
It's time to get off this shelf


I'm tired of not having any trust
I'm tired of always feeling so much lust
I'm tired of wondering if you're out doing me wrong
I'm tired of always singing the same old song
I'm tired of always feeling like a fool
I'm tired of never feeling cool
I'm tired baby oh I'm tired


'Cause I'm half crazy feeling sorry for myself
But I can't keep going on like this
It's time to get off this shelf
'Cause I'm half crazy feeling sorry for myself
But I can't keep going on like this
It's time to get off this shelf


I'm tripping I'm slipping
I'm falling down this hill
I'm crying I'm dying
I'm wishing for a thrill


'Cause I'm half crazy feeling sorry for myself
But I can't keep going on like this
It's time to get off this shelf
'Cause I'm half crazy feeling sorry for myself
But I can't keep going on like this
It's time to get off this shelf
Verse 1:
What's up fresh it's our turn baby
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suit
Ain't got no job but I stay sharp

You know you're a queen right
Black queen ruby red lips movin' like a pencil
I ain't tryna offend nobody
I'm just tryna enlighten ya
Excuse me if I come off a little condescending
I never meant to uh I just want you to know
That a woman's worth is not determined by her clothes
No matter what she wears
Or how low she goes
Her value's not based on some jewelries
Or what a thug says
We've got to love and appreciate ourselves
Ladies you're worth it all day
And every day put your head high and keep it movin'
You deserves respect and love from those deserving of it
And don't let no one take from you what God gave ya
So I just want you to know that you're worth everything
And no one can take that away from you

Under the blue moon I saw you
So soon you'll take me
Up in your arms too late to beg you
Or cancel it though I know it must be the killing time
Unwillingly mine


Fate up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until you give yourself to him

In starlit nights I saw you
So cruelly you kissed me
Your lips a magic world
Your sky all hung with jewels
The killing moon
Will come too soon


Fate up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until you give yourself to him

Under the blue moon I saw you
So soon you'll take me
Up in your arms too late to beg you
Or cancel it though I know it must be the killing time
Unwillingly mine


Fate up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until you give yourself to him
You can run you can hide but you can't escape my love
Here's how it goes you and me up and down but maybe this time
We'll get it right worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks all it takes is some trying
If you feel like leaving I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding you can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
So if you go you should know it's hard to just forget the past
So fast it lasts to the end
If the days aren't easy and the nights are rough
When they ask you what you're thinking of
Say love love love love
Say love love love love
You can run you can hide but you can't escape my love
Here's how it goes all it takes is some trying
If you feel like leaving I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding you can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
Oh oh oh yeah yeah

Here's how it goes you and me up and down but maybe this time
We'll get it right worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks all it takes is some trying
If you feel like leaving I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding you can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love

Verse 1:
It's not difficult to explain
Why she's still here
Miss twenty-five it's so real
To me she's like heaven
And I wanna touch the sky
No bullsh*tting no lie
She's not just a lover or a friend
I love her and I need her
But believe me you don't see her
And it's not like we're trying to hide
Just that doing it's in stride
We simply love each other's company
She is my everything

Chorus:
I love you you love me
We'll always be together
Just you and me
I'll always be forever
I love you you love me
We'll always be together

Verse 2:
She's the one I can't forget
But you haven't heard the half of it yet
Long legs dark hair
She's a bad motherf*cker you best beware
And She's not just my girl
She's my rider die or ride
And I can never locate a fault
Maybe no one is perfect after all
And it's not like we're trying to hide
Just that doing it's in stride
We simply love each other's company
She is my everything

Bridge:
Can't imagine life without her
Love without her it's just unheard of
I know I won't find another that's for sure
That makes me feel the way she does
I love you I love you too

It's the remix remix uh-huh
Bad Boy and the Ruff Ryders remix remix
Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip
Yo

His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
He's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking how Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out time's up over BLOW
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked
He's so mad but he won't give up that easy No
He won't have it he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter he's dope he knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rhapsody better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and

The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
A normal life is boring but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder only grows hotter
He bloes it's all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads God only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partna but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum dum da da

No more games I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mother fuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie there's no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed plus teeter totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go with my shot feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better

The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
M&M
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder only grows hotter
He bloes it's all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads God only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partna but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum dum da da
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies

Deep inside
When you and I
Are intertwined
I don't wanna stop
It's my paradise

We can rock we can roll
And I can give you all

We can dance we can sing
And do anything
That we wanna do
When you're here beside me
Love is a glowing flame

And even when we touch the sky
I feel the rhythm of your heart
It's the greatest thing
It's fantastic

You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Yeah yeah yeah

Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control my butterflies
You give me butterflies

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "What About Us" by Brandy:


I'm feeling kinda strange
I'm feeling really low
I need to get myself together
So I can get back in control


I never felt this way
I don't know what to do
But I know I gotta do something
To get back to being true


What about us
What about all the times we've been through
What about all the things that we made it through
What about all the things that we said we'd do
What about all the promises that we made to each other


I'm sick and tired of this
I don't want to feel like this no more
I need to figure out what's going on
And I gotta do it before I hit the floor


I never thought it'd be like this
I never thought it'd be so hard
But I know I gotta keep going
And make a brand new start


What about us
What about all the times we've been through
What about all the things that we made it through
What about all the things that we said we'd do
What about all the promises that we made to each other


I know that things won't be the same
But we can make it work if we do it again
I don't want to give up on us
I want to make it work


What about us
What about all the times we've been through
What about all the things that we made it through
What about all the things that we said we'd do
What about all the promises that we made to each other
You're a song
Written by the hands of god
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things
I deserve for being such a good girl honey

Because of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things
I deserve for being such a good girl honey
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Rainy Dayz" by Mary J Blige featuring Ja Rule:


Woo ohh ohh woo ohh ohh ohh
Woo ohh ohh woo ohh ohh ohh


Looking back in time when I
Had you on my mind
Oh how I wish I could turn back time
Cause now I'm all alone
Wishing you'd come home
Baby why did you have to go


Woo ohh ohh woo ohh ohh ohh

It's just like The Reverend in the devil's world
Stuck in the rain thinkin' 'bout better days
Listenin' to the devil in me like yeah
Fuck all these hallways I'm tryna get me paid
Stuck in the darkness and the wrath of the rain
Love ain't no love when you monopolize the game
Watch these snake niggas they're quick to switch
Lay low in the grass when that beef get thick
Don't forget who let these niggas in
It's gonna take more than the rain to stop our reign
Let's go


Woo ohh ohh woo ohh ohh ohh
Woo ohh ohh woo ohh ohh ohh


Maybe I belong to you

See its kinda like fate how we met on the train
In the station downtown Brooklyn a quarter to ten
It was sunny - I was on my way to the money
"Anything can happen" - lil' somethin' he was talkin'
Bout his life and how we both from the same hood
He was real cool - and yo he had that good look
Sound intelligent - but still had that hood shit
My train stopped - I wish we had more time to talk
But he smiled - and yo the next time I walk
Through these streets I'll be lookin' for him
He's gone and I'm wonderin' if I'll ever see him again


You're rocking with the hottest this is HOT ninety-seven
You're streaming on Hot97com worldwide my name is Angie Martinez
We're keeping you company till the morning light


If I could go
On and on and on
On and on and on
I would go and on and on
On and on and on


My man came through and made me forget about you
Started feelin' kinda guilty but it wasn't my fault
It reminded me how we both had to go now
Wishin' you would come through but I know it's a wrap
He took me to the car wash then we hit a bar
You shoulda seen the look on his face when I said it's my car
The way he laughed damn baby I miss that
Every time I think about it I get sad and stressed


Lil' Mo with the hottest joints out from Murder Inc
Pepsi This is Hot 97 and Angie Martinez


If I could go on and on and on
On and on and on
I would go and on and on
On and on and on
If I could go on and on and on
On and on and on
I would go and on and on
On and on and on


Yo I was dancin' to Slow Motion shorty came close to me
I said "Which one of y'all be the host with me"
She said "It's my day I deserve a toast with me"
We drank Mo'et undressed calmly
I was alone while I watched you on TV
I'm reminiscin' when you wrote your number on that CD
I miss you - I wanna kiss you where your hips at
Times seem short that we laughed and discussed
The crimson crush - it was us against the fuss
You were my duchess and I was your don
I know we had to move on our paths have been redrawn


It's HOT ninety-seven Angie Martinez - Let's keep it moving


If I could go
On and on and on
On and on and on
I would go and on and on
On and on and on


If I could go on and on and on

I would go and on and on
On and on and on
If I could go on and on and on
On and on and on
I would go and on and on
On and on and on


Mmm hmm
Started thinkin' 'bout it - then my man walked in
"Hey yo where you been"
He kissed me on my cheek then he told me "Let's go"
And all he wanted was a hug and some flow
Flowed until the DJ closed - we both laughed
Told him "I was thinkin' we could do somethin' different instead"
Thinkin' of you though I can't get you outta my head
But I mean it when I say - "So much left to talk about"
Wanna be there when the day that we can figure it out


It's Angie Martinez HOT ninety-seven
With the hottest joints in the city you know how we do
Keepin' you company 'till the morning light

Baby - you should know this
If I could go - you know I would
Come get at you - I wish I could
It's real - difficult
Baby - you should know this
Yeah yeah
I'm afraid of the future
Y'all respect the one who got shot
I respect the shooter
It's talkin' loud sayin' nothin'
You talkin' 'bout "What's mine is mine"
And "What's yours is our's"
What's the difference from slavery
We all rob from the poor
What happened to new leaders
And who would bring peace to those
Who need it the most more and more
Have morphine and demerol
I don't want to lie to myself anymore
When justice will just be
A big ol' booty what you say uh
Me and my homies
Stay greedy not needy
We get together like
We some paraplegics on steady feet
Creepin' and crawlin'
I can see ladie's sprawlin'
Legs open wide like
Eleven "The World is Mine"
Can't give up now I'd rather be deceased
Than to see my enemies succeed
Stayin' a G at all times
Situation no win
Filthy move scrubbin' floors
And pourin' syrup in diners
But spit-shinin' armour
'Crossed the street to avoid starin'
It's like we in a quiet war
And nobody don't want it to start but
It's steady goin' 'go head on'
And that's the word from the heart yeah
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder why
I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder why
I keep from going under uh
To elongate this process
Just elevate your head
State your name 'cause
Deep resumes is the game
And we're strictly business
Understand
Skinny man
I'm always up to no good
Whenev' I roam
Anywhere on land
But when I stroll up in the party
All you gon' end up sayin' is
"Lord oh lord why'd he go and do that"
"Seems like he's always involved in something"
"I try not to bother nobody"
"But I tell you"
"I tell you now"
"Don't know what you're gonna do uh"
"But uh I want to doom doom ta doom doom"
"Doom doom ta doom doom - doom"
"Doom doom ta doom doom ta doom doom"
"I'm the man up in this piece"
"Who we got on the line"
"Hello"
"This is me myself and I"
"And all my gangsta affiliates"
"And we'll break you down to size quick"
"For all that fakin' it uh huh"
"And we'll make you see right through that"
"You hate that don't you"
"Uh huh you hate that"
"You're just no good"
"You're no good" uh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder why
I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder why
I keep from going under uh huh

Many thanks for choosing me as your assistant and here are the uncensored lyrics of "Underneath It All" by No Doubt featuring Lady Saw:
 

There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me there's times when this dress
Ties me up in chains
All your compliments and your cutting remarks
Are captured here in my ears
Like a tin can phone throw me a line
And I'm seasick on the ocean


It's you that I adore
You'll always be my whore
You'll be the mother of my child
And a child to my heart
We must never be apart


We must never be apart
Lovin' you is like a song I replay
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day uh-huh
And every chorus was written for us to recite right
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night
This potion might this ocean might carry me
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
And every word every second and every third
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard uh-huh
And when I play them every chord is a poem
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him
The harmonies possess a sensation
Similar to your caress uh-huh
If you asked then I'm telling you it's yes
Standin' by your side won't let go
And nothin' no one can deny it
Don't try it uh-huh

It's funny how simple things turn out to be
So much sweeter than the honey from the bees
I hear a lot of stories 'bout sinners and their glory
But you baby are a saint don'tcha know

It's written all over your face
Standin' lost in world in outer space

You touch me like a child touchin' a porcelain tile
And it feels like home and you leave me
Into zones unknown said I'm into zones unknown no lie

It's funny how simple things turn out to be
So much sweeter than the honey from the bees
I hear a lot of stories 'bout sinners and their glory
But you baby are a saint don'tcha know
You're all that I wanted
Of a girl you're everything
You're all that I need


Ohhhhhh this love we've created
Through out theses years uh-huh
Will take us around the world uh-huh
Through all the trials and the tears no lie
Our love will keep us alive
The honey from the bees


Our loveOur love is like a melody uh-huh
Our loveThat you hear and you can't help singin' along singing on and on
Our loveAnd when you're feeling right it's right then
Our loveAnd when I'm feelin' wrong it turns out all right said it's all right
Our loveSo let me let me let me let me let me
Let me be your passenger let me be your passenger
Our loveLet me let me let me let me let me
Let me steer you in the right direction said let me show
Got to take your love for granted love for granted
Forget about the silly complicated silly complicated
It's all about loving you baby loving
Got to take your love got to hold it take it and hold it
Love ain't always perfect I'll tell you no no
Always always love you baby our love our love

Can't nobody hold me down like my lady
Nobody nobody
And I can't explain why your loving makes me crazy
Shook up hooked up yeah


I remember when we first met it was on a train
You were heading to college I was crazy in the game
So I flagged you over said "Let me have a word"
We spent the whole night talking 'til our voices weren't heard
You had a man you say he's just a friend
But I knew it was more though it was something within
You caught me at the right time staring at the wall
I was thinking 'bout ya face looking like a model
Every time I close my eyes I go back to the days
When we would sit and talk laugh in the park barefoot in the grass
You reminiscing 'bout ya past I'm trying to make a future
Together taking pictures having barbecues and all that
And even when I'm gone you know I'm not alone
Cause I'll always have my baby on the other side of the phone I'm saying


Can't nobody hold me down like my lady
Nobody nobody
And I can't explain why your loving makes me crazy
Shook up hooked up yeah


I give you everything you want and everything you need
Even though you drive me crazy boy you making me weak
I know you're out there hustling chasing your dreams
But don't chase them too hard cause you got me I mean
A friendly conversation a pretty smile and all that
It wasn't hard for me to fall knock a wall you broke that
You're my rider my rider you're all that I need
I'm waving my flag you got me like a feen
Got me all fucked up like a crack fiend
I'm saying all this cause I mean ahhh everything


Can't nobody hold me down like my lady
Nobody nobody
And I can't explain why your loving makes me crazy
Shook up hooked up yeah


I hit you with the whopper in the back of the car
You know my repertoire I shoot real far
And make your toes curl up make your ovaries swirl up
I'm taking my time though I'm trying to give you the world though
And can't nobody hold me down like you do
Loving that you give me body and soul too
Never gave it up I receive it with pride
It's what I'm living for cause working nine-to-five is not live
I gotta keep you satisfied you know how I do
A little CBD to get you in the mood
I'm talking love not sex cause we above the rest
Girl I want you with me forever till death I'm saying


Can't nobody hold me down like my lady
Nobody nobody
And I can't explain why your loving makes me crazy
Shook up hooked up yeah

And I can't explain why your loving makes me crazy
Shook up hooked up yeah

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "Gone" by 'N Sync:


Yeah yeah


There's a thousand words that I could say to make you come home
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
Maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change


Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To turn back time
I'd give anything to be with you again


There's a thousand lies
That have been told but now it's time to face
The fact that I still love you so
I still love you so
I can't believe the words you said
I can't believe
I can't believe
You chose to walk away


Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To turn back time
I'd give anything anything to be with you again


Gone
And now you're gone
Gone
And I'm here to stay
Gone
I can't live without you
Gone


Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To turn back time
I'd give anything to be with you again


Gone
And now you're gone
Gone
And I'm here to stay
Gone
I can't live without you

What would I be without you What

Livin' up now
Out the trunk came the name of Jah with a buzz
Got a little fame makin' my brain just because
Brothers gotta begin to adapt to the club
Fuckin' with broads recognize with the love
And oh dudes hate 'cause they can't get the love
That I share with my brothers there and I'm here to rub
Pro's ain't nothin' if the dough ain't no good
And oh what a world that we live it's sugar hey
Love and hate niggas make mistakes
Chosen by the grace of God never late
Makin' for the fact that I'm here for our sakes
This is it watch the kid blow it up turn the page
As we soon touche in this game of grace


What would I be without you Yeah
What would I do without you Uh-huh
What would I be without you Sing come on
What would I do without you What would I do


Squad Airin' 'em out
Big ballin' with my Cali friend times runnin' out
Bouts to appear in the first of the year and hopefully clearin'
Myself of all charges plotin' out my takeover like the Yardies
You know what I'm doin' to the ones I'm true to
Niggas screamin' "Jeepers creepers" can't keep up with the Diva
When it comes to Milli Vanilli Ja Rule not the one to follow
Don't go that-a-way you're headed for sorrow
Livin' it up todipi-dipi-di what to dairy ya what
Ja Rule why they gotta play's like that

What would I be without you oh-whoa
What would I do without you Yeah


What would I be without you Ooh-ooh

Yes I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Rollout My Business" by Ludacris:

ROLL OUT

I got my twin glock 40s cocked back
Me and my homies so drop that
We rollin' on twenties with the top back
So much money you can't stop that

Twin Glocks make you do flips like acrobats
Ludacris back in the back of the Acura
Pistol off my lap 'cause I'm an actor
Another movie then it's another plaque uh
I'm feelin' cooly I'm chillin' laid back
VIP GA that's where we stay at
Valet the Benz and yes give me my twenties back
Then hop in the Hummer left back-to-back
Screamin' "Autobot roll out" I'm transformin'
Abracadabra the car's up exotic form
Feet the size of tire brands make the ground shake
And the trunk space got enough bass to make Godzilla do the Harlem Shake
I roll up front and roll down the back
So let your windows up 'cause there's about to be a breeze
Roll out

Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out

I got my twin glock 40s me and my homies
In my 'llac lack dodgin' strays from funny
Honies 'cause fools be trippin'
When they see' em strippin'
Wit' the satin in my britches and the gin in my system
Hatin' 'cause I'm made and lawd they hate that
Moguls been gettin' money since I made Run "DMC" stacks
Don't blame me blame the scrilla that made me
Hooked me with lost of paper plus had no choice but to pay me
I don't keep guns in my house or my car
But I learned from the best always keep my business far
Away from these haters 'cause they wait for mistakes
Make a phone call to six-five-four-one-three-seven-eight
Says "Sunny come over" now he knockin atcha' gate
It's the mid night 7:45 another day another dollar
Got to make that money man it's still the same ol' sour
I'ma' "I'ma get it I'ma get it today"
I'ma' "I'ma swerve I'ma swerve in my lane"
I'm the best when it comes to makin' hits
And I'm the best at holdin' down my dick licked
Mrs Miyagi can not do what I do
NG-G they wish they could erase me
Face me break me see what I'm made of
Activate and smash on a regular basis roll out

Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out

So now I'm on a role cadillac pimpin'
Four El Dorado's and they all sittin' on twankies
Alligator seats with the head sunk in
A smooth bachelor still tippin' snap your fingas'
I'm hollerin about that big money talk
And I'm a stranger give me the key to the vault
I'm fixed and I'm focussed I'm ready to go
I smell it like a dog and I'm ready to hunt a foe
So gimme the fortune all the fame is mine
And I'm steppin out' models all the haterz behind
All yellin' stop I'm stepping out on paid
And all my atoms yellin' get em' Luda
But rugged and rowdy you betta not try me
But if you rutha' take a hole come on and sign me
But afterwards they betta not harras me
Unless they want to suffer from the pimpin' catastrophe
Master P I'm bout it bout it certified
Niggas can't make no decision they terrified roll out

Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out roll out roll out
Roll out
Don't wanna be an angel
Just wanna be that man for you
I've been hiding in these shadows
For way too long
Watching you watching me
Makes my heart skip a beat

Here is gone here is gone
Why why'd you have to wait
To find me to find me
Here is gone here is gone
Why when you're near me
I feel so feel so wrong

I've been dreaming about you
Every night when I close my eyes
And you're always there beside me
But when I wake up
It's just me just me
Feeling so damn lonely

Here is gone here is gone
Why why'd you have to wait
To find me to find me
Here is gone here is gone
Why when you're near me
I feel so feel so wrong

Don't tell me that you love me
If you don't really mean it
Cause baby I'd rather be alone
Than be your fool

Here is gone here is gone
Why why'd you have to wait
To find me to find me
Here is gone here is gone
Why when you're near me
I feel so feel so wrong

Here is gone here is gone
Why why'd you have to wait
To find me to find me
Here is gone here is gone
Why when you're near me
I feel so feel so wrong
Verse 1:
It's time for us to say goodbye to yesterday
We're moving on to what we hope and pray will be a better day
I know you're gonna get yourself together somehow
I'll go try to do the same right now
Got me singing

Chorus:
No more pain No more pain
No more pain No more pain
No more drama No more drama
In my life In my life
No more tears No more tears
No more crying No more crying
No more hurting No more hurting
I'm moving on I'm moving on

Verse 2:
This time I'll be bulletproof
This time I'll be ready to shoot
Start off fresh don't look back
It'll hurt me but I'll get over that
Give me a reason to love again
Give me a reason to start again
I know I've got to be strong

Chorus:
No more pain No more pain
No more pain No more pain
No more drama No more drama
In my life In my life
No more tears No more tears
No more crying No more crying
No more hurting No more hurting
I'm moving on I'm moving on

Bridge:
I paid my dues I'm owed some good news 
I've stood in the rain I've been through the pain 
I've worked through sorrow and held tomorrow 
Now it's my time my time to shine

Chorus:
No more pain No more pain
No more pain No more pain
No more drama No more drama
In my life In my life
No more tears No more tears
No more crying No more crying
No more hurting No more hurting
I'm moving on I'm moving on

Baby baby baby baby
I'm waiting on you baby
Baby baby baby baby
I'm waiting on you baby
Well me and my lady had our first big fight/
So I drove around until I saw the neon light/
A corner bar an it just seemed right so I pulled up/
Not a soul around but the old bar keep/
Down at the end and looking half asleep/
But he walked up and said "What'll it be"
I said "The good stuff"
He didn't reach around for the whiskey/
He didn't pour me a beer/
His blue eyes kinda went misty/
He said "You can't find that here/
'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date/
Momma's all worried when you get home late/
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate 'cause your hands are shakin'/
You find out she's a little bit crazy/
And drinks wine cooler beer whiskey and scotch/
And drives you crazy but you wouldn't have it any other way/
She's everything you want to say to a woman/
But wouldn't 'cause you're a afraid you'll ruin your reputation/
And I's all caught up in the moment/
A thing smoke vodka and gin/
But to tell you the truth I've been lying/
It's all I know to do to hide my blue/
Yeah and loneliness has got the best of me/
But yeah I'm finally on the mend/
'Cause she talked me into trading/
My lunch box for a guitar/
And I handed her a beer/
And said "I'm not scared/
I'm just cautious/
Is all"
And all the good stuff/

Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
When I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
Well since you came along
I can face the dawn
'Cause I know you'll be there

Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
When I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

I never worry
If it's raining outside
'Cause in here with you girl
The sun always shines
Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
When I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

I hope you're feeling
The same way as me
You woke up ready to seize
Another day
I've got everything
I need right here
In this bed baby
Oh baby

Good morning beautiful
How was your night
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
When I open my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

Good morning beautiful
I said good morning beautiful
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Rock the Boat" by Aaliyah:

Boy you know you make me float
Boy you really get me high
I feel like I'm on dope
'Cause you you serve me on a regular

Boy you gotta stroke before drifting me deeper
Stroke me like a king I'll be your queen
I love it when you make me moan
Need that ooh ah sound give it to me

'Cause you you got a full of vibe
And I I'm feeling it in my ride
Got me twisted but still I gotta have it
Explosive dynamite I'mma rock your body baby

'Til the water starts to rise ride it
Ooh baby give me more make me fly
That ooh ah sensation yeah
We're rocking the boat we're slowly drifting

Out to sea off into the night
Ooh come on

Boy you gotta stroke before drifting me deeper
Stroke me like a guitar blow my mind

And I I'm feeling it in my soul

Well way up yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just livin' for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just livin' for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Well now we parked way out in a clearing
In a pik-up truck with the radio on
The night was fallin' as the bass started thumpin'
All the pretty girls they were out there a jumpin'

Oh I was soakin' wet with my heart a thumpin'
We were parked in the shade of a Georgia pine
Oh and then a pickup truck loaded down
With 5 or 6 kids all headed to the river
Aww it was just an old worn out Jimmy
With a couple of baled hay and a homemade trailer
And we were takin' it to the river' 'bout a mile from there
But them barefoot boys they was smilin'
'Cause they were headed to the swimming hole

"Oh I remember oh I remember
Oh I remember oh I remember"

Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just livin' for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Verse 1:
What if the world was falling apart
And there was no light to break up the dark
And if you feel that way baby don't give up
Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake up

Chorus:
And I'm standing still without you
And I'm staring at the moon
And I'm hoping that you're on the other side
Talking to me too or am I a fool
Who sits alone talking to the moon

Verse 2:
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
And is there a pounding in your head
Oh Jane you want me back again
Well that's breaking me breaking me in

Chorus:
And I'm standing still without you
And I'm staring at the moon
And I'm hoping that you're on the other side
Talking to me too or am I a fool
Who sits alone talking to the moon

Bridge:
I'm not sure what you want me to say
Well I guess I'll just pray
That you're feeling feeling okay
I'm not sure what you want me to do
Well I'm trying to see you
Through a hole on my side

Chorus:
And I'm standing still without you
And I'm staring at the moon
And I'm hoping that you're on the other side
Talking to me too or am I a fool
Who sits alone talking to the moon
Verse 1: Jaheim
I got a problem something's callin'
And I think it's my heart
Caught up in the middle undecided
And tearing me apart yeah
I don't know what's right or wrong
But something's got me feeling so strong
And I know I ain't ever felt like this before

Chorus: Jaheim & Next
Anything you want from me
I'll do it
I'll do it
If it makes you happy
I'll go through it
Through it
Anything you want from me
I'll do it
I'll do it
If it makes you happy

Verse 2: Next
No other woman no other love
Could ever take my heart
I'm addicted to you so hypnotized
And so in love girl
No matter what you want from me
I'll do anything is my guarantee
Something about your kiss just drives me crazy

Chorus: Jaheim & Next
Anything you want from me
I'll do it
I'll do it
If it makes you happy
I'll go through it
Through it
Anything you want from me
I'll do it
I'll do it
If it makes you happy

Bridge: Next
Oh lady you're my heaven
And I'm searching for that callin'
Let's take a chance and run away
And we can do anything baby

Chorus: Jaheim & Next
Anything you want from me
I'll do it
I'll do it
If it makes you happy
I'll go through it
Through it
Anything you want from me
I'll do it
I'll do it
If it makes you happy
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Full Moon" by Brandy:


Must be your skin that I'm sinking in
Must be for real cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind it's not my kind
It's not my time to wonder why


Everything's gone white and everything's grey
Now you're here now you're away
I don't want this remember that
I'll never forget where you're at


Don't let the days go by
Glycerin glycerin
I'm never alone I'm alone all the time
Are you at one or do you lie
We live in a wheel where everyone steals
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields


If I treated you bad you bruise my face
Couldn't love you more you've got a beautiful taste
Don't let the days go by
Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should I have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me


Glycerin glycerin
Don't let the days go by glycerin
Don't let the days go by
Glycerin glycerin


Don't let the days go by
Glycerin
Could have been easier on you you you
Glycerin glycerin
Water is the most important thing on earth
Without water there is no life without life
There is nothing but death


I feel better when I'm on my own
I'll break the tether and I'll break the choke
I'm on my knees and you're gone
Dragged from the bottom pulled out the knot
I will provide the uncensored lyrics of "A New Day Has Come" by Celine Dion as requested:

A new day has come 
A new day has come 

I was waiting for so long 
For a miracle to come 
Everyone told me to be strong 
Hold on and don't shed a tear 

Through the darkness and good times 
I knew I'd make it through 
And the world thought I had it all 
But I was waiting for you 

Hush now I see a light in the sky 
Oh it's almost blinding me 
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love 

Let it fill my soul and drown my fears 
A new day has come 

Where it was dark now there's light 
Where there was pain now there's joy 
Where there was weakness I found my strength 
All in the eyes of a boy 

Hush now I see a light in your eyes 
All in the eyes of a boy 
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love 

Let it fill my soul and drown my fears 
A new day has come 

Oh let it fill my soul and drown my fears 
A new day has come
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "My List" by Toby Keith:

Under an old brass paperweight 

Is my list of things to do today 

Go to the bank and the hardware store 

Put a new lock on the cellar door 

I cross 'em off as I get 'em done 

But when the sun is set 

There's still more than a few things left 

I haven't got to yet 

Wouldn't the world be better off 

If they took down the walls 

And erected no trespassing signs 

And just enjoyed the fall 

It's times like these I sit and think 

Of all the things I haven't done 

And in a short time 

Suddenly I'm old 

And none of it's been done 

I don't know how old I am 

But I'm old now 

And I've had a good life 

So all you younguns take my advice 

And don't let the world get you down 

If the good Lord's willin' and the creeks don't rise 

I'll be here tomorrow 

To high-five you yesterday 

Yesterday's gone 


If it weren't for your maturity none of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention you wouldn't have been successful and
If it weren't for me you would never have amounted to very much

Ooh this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're kind of my protégé and one day you'll say you learned all you know from me
I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would and I think I like it

Ooh this could get messy
But you don't seem to mind
Ooh don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget
What with this distance it seems so obvious

Just make sure you don't tell on me especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world because you're such a pretty thing
When you're done with me I fear that you'll just disappear from me

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this
He was a boy she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
He was a punk she did ballet
What more can I say

He wanted her she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
And all of her friends stuck up their nose
And they had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy she said "see you later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now she sits at home
Feeding the baby she's all alone
She turns on TV guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV

She calls up her friends they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy she said "see you later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth

He was a skater boy she said "see you later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth

Sorry girl but you missed out
Well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends

Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
We are in love haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world

I'm with the skater boy I said "see you later boy"
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know

I'm with the skater boy I said "see you later boy"
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know
"Daddy sits on the front porch swingin'
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will

My brother found work in Indiana
Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama's still cooking too much for supper
And me I've been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin' back again

Delia plays that ol' church piano
Sittin' out on her daddy's farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm

Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me I heard her prayin' for me
Out of nowhere into nothin'
Lord I'm here to keep her company

Been a long time gone
No I ain't honked a horn since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin' back again

Now me I went to college
And dropped outta' law school
I kinda' figured out that I wasn't good at playin' by the rules

I'ma make a life outta' takin'
And givin' and nothin's gonna stop me now

Been a long time gone
No I ain't burned a bridge just to light me a way
Been a short time gone
And the dealin's done"

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning" by Alan Jackson:

Where were you when the world stopped turning
On that September day
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in LA
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of
That black smoke rising against that blue sky
Did you shout out in anger and fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry

Did you weep for the children they lost their dear loved ones
Or pray for the ones who don't know
Did you rejoice for the people who walked through the valleys of death
And remember the ones who have gone
Did you follow the banner or did it lead you to anger
Did you meditate on forgiveness
Or did you just stay out of sight
In the shadow of the truth

Did you open your eyes hoping it was all just a nightmare
Or did you realize that life is sometimes unfair
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
Or relieved would you say if you could breathe again
Did you cherish the moments with those that you love
And find out what else they're made of
Did you stand in line to give your blood
Or give your money away

Did it make you doubt the deity you worshiped
Did it make you believe more in the things that you've been taught
Did it make you count your blessings
Or just look for someone to blame
Did you know a freedom could disappear in a second
And never return again

Where were you when the world stopped turning
On that September day

Got my drink and my two-step 'cause I'm doin' my thing
Bringin' all the hot chicks to the floor
All eyes on me people yellin' out for more

Grab your girl everybody let's get retarded

Chorus
Lights camera action it's time to make a scene

So keep your eyes on me 'cause I'm the one to watch
Mr Cheeks and crew we're gonna keep it hot
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "7 Days" by Craig David:

On my way to see my friends  
Who lived a couple blocks away from me owh  
As I walked through the subway  
It must have been about quarter past three

In front of me  
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body  
She asked me for the time  
I said it'd cost her her name  
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine  
Did she decline No  
Didn't she mind I don't think so  
Was it for real Damn sure  
What was the deal A pretty girl aged 24  
So was she keen She couldn't wait  
Cinnamon queen Let me update  
What did she say She said she'd love to  
Lend me the money for a ticket but couldn't cause' she was due to fly

  
So I told her I would mind  
We spent some time conversating  
She said she's got a man but he's not that understanding

I said "why does it matter"  
I'm happy to be your new friend  
Cause I know in the end  
It'll be me and you that be groovin'

  
And we walked  
Down to the underground  
And the breeze and the feeling  
We were heading for the weekend

They played our favorite song  
And I saw you gettin' down  
Well you came up to me  
And then you started groovin'

And that's exactly what I thought we'd do  
So come on baby I'll take you on a journey  
Through the memories of you and me owh  
Cause it's been seven days  
And I can't even drop my duffle bag owh  
Nobody's perfect but we got to work it  
Again and again till we get it right  
Because we love each other  
We got to love each other keep the vibe  
Because we love each other  
Nothing's gonna stop us we'll survive  
Because we love each other  

  
We love each other x3  
Cause It's been seven days seven days  
And I can't even come up with the words to say words to say  
Girl I'll go out of my way  
I hope you enjoy the song have a great day
Verse 1: Ludacris
I'm in the 'Burban it's parked and I'm swervin'
Officer I'm sorry but that's just how I'm servin'
Yeah they tryna take me to jail but they can't
I'm too real f*ck 'em that's how I feel
Bleed like I bleed my lows or they lows
I'm the one and only call me the CEO
My swag's untouchable they mad 'cause I'm cuttable
My lyrics are beautiful they wanna be suitable
F*ck that I'm Ludacris I run shit
Like diarrhea got fire like a chimney yeah yeah
They call me a menace but I call it truth
So keep talkin' shit and I'mma lace you with these boots
I'm a stay strapped got damnit I refuse
Anything movin' slow give it to Mystikal to abuse

Chorus: Ludacris
Move bitch get out the way
Get out the way bitch get out the way
Move bitch get out the way
Get out the way bitch get out the way

Verse 2: Mystikal
I have come fo' to cut da heads off of these haters
'Cause dey like mosquitoes to a player shh shh
And if you're scared of a dog then get a cat get a cat
They come in packs and askin' fo' ass and where your stash at
I know we the home team but we'll visit where they play
I'm hating mo' than 50% of these n*ggas in the game and they mad they mad
They don't wanna take it outside 'cause they'd rather knuckle up and fight
Dirty n*gga done stumbled into somethin' with a knife
Add slice add dice add chopping add price
Add late night to early mornin' add life
The time has arrived and we the mothaf*ckin' champs
It's time to ride 'cause we represent the Dirty South

Chorus: Ludacris
Move bitch get out the way
Get out the way bitch get out the way
Move bitch get out the way
Get out the way bitch get out the way

Verse 3: I-20 Lil' Fate
You see that six-pack that's the six pack of Hydro
And you see in the back that's the back of my Mauro
I'm rollin' with Dre and my boy Ludacris
And I came to get some money but I ain't come for this
I'll catch you in the streets I'll catch you off your feet
I'll catch you when you sleep when you ain't thinkin' 'bout me
Now move get out the way 'fore I put you on your ass
And make you bump your head when I dump this lead
Now move get out the way and let a soldier pass
And I don't give a God damn I'm doin' me
And it feels so good when ya done done it
And I'ma put my city A-T-L on it
And I don't give a damn 'cause they done done it
And I know we done it but they can't scream it we run it

Chorus: Ludacris
Move bitch get out the way
Get out the way bitch get out the way
Move bitch get out the way
Get out the way bitch get out the way

Take me off the block out the hood what
Got a good job i work hard but

Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
Baby grind with me relax your mind take your time with me

Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
Baby grind with me relax your mind take your time with me

We've been together for a few years shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like sugar plum and pookie bear
I'm always on the road I'm hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that can't talk on the phone
I know you aggrevated walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short how long can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated I do this for us
Step on stage see my face it's just for you I spit these bars
If you ever got mad I'm sorry sorry
Just remember that your my heart beat heartbeat
And damn I'm missing you tonight you already know who's playing
Ms Gladys Knight


Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
Baby grind with me relax your mind take your time with me
I love you deeper if you cry for me now come and kiss me till your body gets weak


Grind on me relax your mind take your time with me
I love you deeper if you cry for me now come and kiss me till your body gets weak
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Living and Living Well" by George Strait:

Verse 1:
I've got a bottle of wine
And a perfectly divine bed of roses
And with a little luck
This old truck will get me home
There's a red moon risin'
And a touch of mist in the air
I take one last look around
And everywhere I look I see
Hard working people
Ain't nothing easy in this life
All the bills and the boss man
And the pain and the strife
But I've got a good woman
And she loves me unconditionally
So tonight I'm gonna lay right here
And set my worries free

Chorus:
Living and living well
Go together like books and shelves
And me and you girl we're gonna
Live it up for all it's worth
Living and living well
Hearts together like a wishing well
Our dreams come true I'm telling you
Cause we know what it's worth

Verse 2:
The sun ain't even close
To being on the rise
But I'm wide awake I'm feeling great
And ready to survive
All the hustle and bustle
And the city never sleeps
I'm just a country boy
But I'm right at home on these streets
I've got my darlin'
And she's all I need
So tonight I'm gonna lay right here
And count my blessings indeed

Chorus:
Living and living well
Go together like books and shelves
And me and you girl we're gonna
Live it up for all it's worth
Living and living well
Hearts together like a wishing well
Our dreams come true I'm telling you
Cause we know what it's worth

Bridge:
It's a great day to be alive
And a good day for dancin'
And a good day to be who you are
And have a little fun in the sun
Cause life is good
And love is great
Let the bad times roll I'll take all I can take

Chorus:
Living and living well
Go together like books and shelves
And me and you girl we're gonna
Live it up for all it's worth
Living and living well
Hearts together like a wishing well
Our dreams come true I'm telling you
Cause we know what it's worth

Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Days Go By" by Dirty Vegas:

Verse 1:
As I wander through this troubled world
Looking for a home searching for a girl
I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
I'm in a cold sweat afraid I'm gonna be late

Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you
Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you

Without you without you without you without you
Through the rain through the storm
You've been my guide you keep me warm
Teach me how to love teach me how to live
Every time I see you something inside me gives

And when I need to find my way

Mmm what a beautiful sound

Ladies and gentlemen
Nelly Furtado has come back to switch up your program

Listen closely see your body line
Feels like the temperature's rising
Oh were you sent here to tempt me cause I
See the fire in your eyes

You're like a siren in the dark
Want to take my hand and take me far
Right now you're playing with my heart
Don't you feel it getting hard


Turn off the light spin me around
Don't ever stop don't slow down
I'mma rock it till the grooves run dry
Light it up on the floor
When I'll drop it like it's hot
Ain't no stopping us tonight


What's the deal Mr DJ
Put a record on I wanna dance with my baby
Do you like to boogie-woogie do you like to rock
I need a sap that's funky when I'm down to get down

Ring ring the alarm
The sound the alarm
Bring bring the alarm
The sound the alarm


Turn off the light spin me around
Don't ever stop don't slow down
I'mma rock it till the grooves run dry

Turn off the light spin me around

Light it up on the floor
When I'll drop it like it's hot
