Ooh ooh sweet love yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so

I should've held on tight I never should've let you go

I didn't know nothing I was stupid I was foolish

I was lying to myself

I could not fathom that I would ever be without your love

Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself

'Cause I didn't know you 'cause I didn't know me

But I thought I knew everything

I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling

Now that I don't hear your voice Oh whoa whoa

Or have your touch and kiss your lips

'Cause I don't have a choice

Oh what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side

Right here 'cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please

'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place There ain't nobody better

Oh baby baby we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind

Bobby Womack's on the radio singing to me:

"If you think you're lonely now wait until tonight"

Boy I'm feeling all out of my element

I'm throwing things crying trying to figure out

Ah-ah Where the hell I went wrong

The pain reflected in this song ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside

I need you need you back in my life baby

When you left I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please

'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place There ain't nobody better

Oh baby baby we belong together baby

When you left I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please

'Cause we belong together

Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place There ain't nobody better

Oh baby baby we belong together

Verse 1: Kanye West]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a trifling friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me


Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

Verse 2: Kanye West]
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it
Now I ain't sayin' I'm a gold digger but I ain't messin' with no broke niggas
I got a get-ta-have-it I gotta have it - uh huh uh huh uh
And if you ain't no punk holla "We want prenup"
"We want prenup" Yeah

You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why y'all washin' watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datson
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he moppin' floors next week it's the fries


So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin' and yeah that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin' but you stay right girl
And when you get on he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone I walk alone
I walk alone and I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah aaah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone I walk alone
I walk alone and I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah aaah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah

I walk alone I walk a

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Candy Shop" by 50 Cent featuring Olivia:


Yeah
Uh huh
So seductive


I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot whoa


I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot whoa


You can have it your way how do you want it
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it
Temperature rising okay let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now baby it's simple
If you be a nympho I'll be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park it's whatever you into


Got the magic stick I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby No problem
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain baby the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl not in your hand ha-ha


I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot whoa


I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got

Temperature rising okay let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed hot as a tea kettle

Girl what we do what we do
And where we do and where we do
The things we do things we do
Are just between me and you oh yeah
Give it to me baby nice and slow
Climb on top ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this before
As soon as I come through the door she get to pulling on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch 'em in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone


I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off she like it from behind
So seductive you should see the way she wind
Her hips in slow mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stopping homie I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with sweat man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign bottle's on me
And on the break of dawn we'll be making love like professionals


I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot whoa


I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy one taste of what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot whoa
Seems like just yesterday  
You were a part of me  
I used to stand so tall  
I used to be so strong  
Your arms around me tight  
Everything it felt so right  
Unbreakable like nothin' could go wrong  

Now I can't breathe no I can't sleep  
I'm barely hangin' on  

Here I am once again  
I'm torn into pieces  
Can't deny it can't pretend  
Just thought you were the one  
Broken up deep inside  
But you won't get to see the tears I cry  
Behind these hazel eyes  

Swallow me then spit me out  
For hating you I blame myself  
Seeing you it kills me now  
No I don't cry on the outside anymore  

Here I am once again  
I'm torn into pieces  
Can't deny it can't pretend  
Just thought you were the one  
Broken up deep inside  
But you won't get to see the tears I cry  

I told you everything  
Opened up and let you in  
You made me feel alright  
For once in my life  
Now all that's left of me  
Is what I pretend to be  
So together but so broken up inside  

'Cause I can't breathe no I can't sleep  
I'm barely hangin' on  

Here I am once again  
I'm torn into pieces  
Can't deny it can't pretend  
Just thought you were the one  
Broken up deep inside  
But you won't get to see the tears I cry  

Here I am once again  
I'm torn into pieces  
Can't deny it can't pretend  
Just thought you were the one  
Broken up deep inside  
But you won't get to see the tears I cry  
Behind these hazel eyes  

Behind these hazel eyes  
Behind these hazel eyes

What day is it And in what month  
This clock never seemed so alive  
I can't keep up and I can't back down  
I've been losing so much time  

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to lose  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you  

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right  
I'm tripping on words  
You've got my head spinning  
I don't know where to go from here  

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to prove  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you  

There's something about you now  
I can't quite figure out  
Everything she does is beautiful  
Everything she does is right  

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to lose  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you  

And me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to prove  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you  

What day is it  
And in what month  
This clock never seemed so alive
Verse 1:
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake shake it off

Chorus:
Ooh you got me feeling kinda naughty
I'm gonna take a chance at my party
Might kiss a little bit of somebody
I don't gotta have him I'mma still be hot
Body against body
Move after move gonna show you
I'm in control
If I want you tonight
I'm gonna dance tonight
Away

Verse 2:
You tried to break my heart
Oh that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No you ain't from the start
Hey I'm glad you drifted away
From guessing rope to hold you
But I'mma be rising up
Ain't no way you gonna hold me down
Now that it's over
I'mma carry on
What you think about that
Don't you know I don't wanna linger
Do you know that I need a man
I'mma dance tonight
And I don't care if you're still around

Chorus:
Ooh you got me feeling kinda naughty
I'm gonna take a chance at my party
Might kiss a little bit of somebody
I don't gotta have him I'mma still be hot
Body against body
Move after move gonna show you
I'm in control
If I want you tonight
I'm gonna dance tonight
Away

Bridge:
You said goodbye draggin' my heart on the floor
Couldn't take it anymore
You said goodbye
No looking back
Can't make me stay
Shake it shake it shake it off
No matter what you do
I'm gonna dance tonight
I'm gonna get my mind off you
Shake it shake it shake it off

Chorus:
Ooh you got me feeling kinda naughty
I'm gonna take a chance at my party
Might kiss a little bit of somebody
I don't gotta have him I'mma still be hot
Body against body
Move after move gonna show you
I'm in control
If I want you tonight
I'm gonna dance tonight
Away

Outro:
Shake it off shake it off baby
Shake it off shake it off baby
Shake it off shake it off baby
Shake it off shake it off baby
Coming out of my cage
And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all

It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss

Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag

Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go

And I just can't look it's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr Brightside

I don't know what you heard about me
But a b**** can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherf****** P-I-M-P


Look homie I ain't nothing but a messenger
With money and a bad b**** my taste buds are excellent
I eat an A1 steak sauce v***ina around my asparagus
I rather have a Prostitute than a prayer no you see
And n****s don't be mad at me
Embrace me or erase me
But I ain't going nowhere until I've got a fat bank roll
And I've hit the baddest b****es know I'm kind of cocky n****


I don't know what you heard about me
But a b**** can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherf****** P-I-M-P


Now shorty she in the club she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci that Fendi that Prada
That BCBG Burberry Dolce & Gabbana
She's feeding fools fantasies they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later have that a** up in the Ramada
Them trick n****s in her ear saying they think about her
I got the b**** by the bar trying to get a drink up out her


I don't know what you heard about me
But a b**** can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherf****** P-I-M-P


I don't know what you heard about me
But a b**** can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherf****** P-I-M-P


I don't know what you heard about me
But a b**** can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherf****** P-I-M-P

Come on come on
Come on come on


I like the way you do it
When you do it right
When you put it on me
It's my night Pon de replay
My rhythm is the best guide
To keep me moving on
You know you feelin' me
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong


With a little bit of eh-eh
With a little bit of eh-eh
You know I'm gonna get it eh-eh
Just give it up to me eh-eh
With a little bit of eh-eh
With a little bit of eh-eh
You know I'm gonna get it eh-eh
Just give it up to me eh-eh


Please don't stop the music
It's getting late
I'm feeling tired and my body aches
But I just keep dancing
Cause I love the way it feels
I can't help myself
I won't stop until I get my fill


With a little bit of eh-eh

Verse 1: The Game
I'm the king of this West Coast 
shit
Eyes low arm out the window 
when I'm lowridin'
Screamin' one-eight-seven 
on anybody tryin'
To fuck with me stackin' Gs 
buyin' them cars
I'm the one they follow 
mentionin' me in they verses
Doin' shows out of town 
pullin' up in their suburbs
Got a lot of beef so 
naturally I creep
With a loaded 45 
ridin' shotgun with me
I ain't even gotta say it 
you know the name
Young G-Malone in the 
house tonight mane

Chorus: 50 Cent
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

Verse 2: The Game
Fresh like "Uh-huh" Impala "Uh-huh"
Chrome hydraulics 
thousand dollar paint job
I'm feelin' good I'm feelin' 
great
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I'm like a heavyweight
When they see me ride by 
they can't help but stare
And I tell 'em "Back up" 
cause I'm strugglin' with the 
wheelie
Since red-handled blade 
and silver-grade
I'm dipped in butter baby 
with a chauffeur to drive me
I'm Boss Hogg on candy 
that's antique
The 62 is mine nigga 
go find you somethin'
Nothin' but backwoods 
sticky weed and gin
You don't like it then wait 
for the album to spin

Chorus: 50 Cent
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

Bridge: The Game
I put Lamborghini 
doors on that Escalade
Lil' Propane got flames 
We can make the front page
I caught Bazookas 
rockin' J's that's how I'm livin'
I ride on 24's they say 
they killin'
But we livin' still
Lil' Pro I'm the 
California king I'm the one 
That you dream of west side 
Banger and I've been gangin' 
Since I was three
Got the coupe on switches 
and the nitrous in the trunk
With the triple gold D's 
keepin' the cash in the bank

Chorus: 50 Cent
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

And that's a pretty nice haircut
Charge it like a superstar
'Cause maybe you'll get by
Beverly Hills that's where I want to be
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Living in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills rolling like a celebrity
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Living in Beverly Hills

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops
Go head envy me I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me


Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now I’m f**ing with 5-0 it’s all starting to make sense
My moms' happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent $30 million on airplanes
When there’s kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what’s going on like I hear Marvin
No school books they use that wood to build coffins
Whenever I’m in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie banked Joseph like Kodak
Cause he ain’t got no game and he ain’t got no chain
Ain’t got shit ain’t got no name
I swear we used to be the American Dream
Nowadays it’s all about a dollar and a scheme


Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops
Go head envy me I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me


From the beginning to the end losers lose when it’s winnin’
This is real we ain’t got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change but it’s stayin’ the same
How many of them boys is with you
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I’m walking with a snub cause niggas do a lot of slip talking in the club
Till they coughing on the rug
Man life ain’t shit but a fat vagina
Screamin’ “Annie are you ok Annie are you ok”
Limo tinted with all kind of amenities in it
My ASIAN chick in it I’m lifting her skirt
Then I beat the pussy like it's mad at me
I ain’t mad at her blood calm down just acting

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops
Go head envy me I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me


From illmatic to stillmatic to the firm to a group to a solo I’ve been loyal
Game winnin’ ain’t so sweet
When you havein’ sleepless nights pissed off and can’t eat
Winning is a short term goal can’t last long
Being real lasts forever still gon’ be strong
When the money and the fame is gone
Then the haters wake up they snooze for too long
Fallen off is easy staying on is hard
Livin’ in the city where the skinny niggas die need a uhh hussle and the muscle to survive
This is the city of dreams where everything’s in motion
And out of motion they’re off the lean and everybody’s got the cup
That they’re pouring liquor out in memory of the dead homies
Pour out a little liquor for pour out a little liquor for


Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops
Go head envy me I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me


Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops

You should holla at your girl tell her "Come through"
I'll be alone so you should come through


Aye it's Ludacris
I'm just feelin' like I'm the one for you
And I ain't gon' stop until I get it

And I'm controllin' all the shots; this here is a monopoly
Go ahead and take a little swig and let the alcohol start speakin' for itself
I'm tryna hit it and leave with it
And leave with it aye I'm tryna hit it and leave with it


And I'll be your lover and your friend

It's Jon oh damn

Big bad wolf on the prowl
A nigga better keep his sheep with him
I'm out to eat hopin' you swallows like it's deep swimmin'
The greatest sex you gon' get bet any fee that's needed
Well if ya really gon' be my baby then you gotta ride with me
Can't have a nigga bustin' up in the passenger side of your ride can we
'Cause it's tight in there ain't it Oh so cluttered and cramped
Feels like a room do it make a path
Boy Lil Jon had the beat stu-strokin'
Kings of crunk be on top forever holdin'
I'm in the club ahead of the rest rip VIP
Pimp cup filled it up drank head shot
Hoo now play your position let me bathe in your juices

You're now tuned to the sound of the king


And I'll be your lover and your friend

Well I'm a Luda aka Mr steal ya girl

I'm with somebody mama so I feel like I'm a king
I'm at the bar sippin' drinks surrounded by ching-chings
Last call cat call come take a sip with me
Yeah that's what the lit like y'all should come visit me
Ludacris got 'em watchin' me suddenly everybody got to jockin' me
Like the elder women even the cougars gettin' hot for me
Southern draws jerkin' black beaches lurkin'
Man I'm tryna get my surf on who wanna get virgined
Oh dance for me baby this my confession
I'm like the preacher's son I'll give you some redemption
I'm tryna wine and dine I'm tryna find somebody's daughter
And when I find her I'll take her home and slaughter


And I'll be your lover and your friend
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'll be your lover and your friend

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed I could breakaway


I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till' I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish take a chance make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk take a chance make a change
And breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane far away
And breakaway


I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till' I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish take a chance make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But gotta keep movin' on movin' on
Fly away breakaway


I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
And I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change
And breakaway

Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change
And breakaway breakaway breakaway

And take a little change

If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just like you
And baby that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real


Cause when we first got together started hanging out
You was skeptical it really doubt
That I was the one that you would fall for
Tried to David Copperfield me and saw my way out
But you persevered and I felt a change
Touched me my heart then melt away
I got turned on by the things you say
I'm in love now and this is what I gotta say


I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things
That you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you
Hold me
We gon' always be together baby

And I believe it cause I ain't neva had
Nobody do me like you


And ever since the day that I met you
I knew you were the girl for me
Cause baby you got me
And ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with my girl you know it's true
And I'm feeling all my highs
And I ain't never been more happy
Cause you're mine and I'm all yours
And never will I betray cause baby you got
Cutie and the class yes you're my everything

I'm the kind of brotha
Who been doin' it my way
Gettin' my bread for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life
I hear love is blind
But I'm 'bout to take the stairs


I'm convinced that you're avoidin' me
I swear I saw you'd be my lover
And it's rumors goin' 'round
That you ain't been gettin' served
They say that you ain't you know what
In baby who knows how long
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm suggested to stray
I'm caught up in the middle
And I'm tryna keep from going under


Baby trust me girl
I got enough of what you need
All that I'm asking is for you to keep it real with me
Yeah


Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems he's got me twisted
Caught up
I'm losing control
This girl got a hold on me
And I'm caught up to her love


I'm so confused by the things you say
And the things you do
See it use to be
That I would be the one
To run to
But I refuse to be played for no fool
Said that you'd be true
And said that you'd be true
But I don't see it in you
Girl I'm losing my mind
And I don't think it's clever


Baby trust me girl
I got enough of what you need
All that I'm asking is for you to keep it real with me
Yeah


Caught up
Got me feeling it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems he's got me twisted
Caught up
I'm losing control
This girl got a hold on me
And I'm caught up to her love


You don't understand
What you're doing to me
I'm all alone
With your company


Caught up
Got me feeling it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems he's got me twisted
Caught up
I'm losing control
This girl got a hold on me
And I'm caught up to her love


Oh Caught up
Got me feelin' it
I don't know I don't know what it is
Tell me did you bruise easily  
Fall apart like leaves in fall  
Do you sometimes feel like  
Nothing much at all 
You feel like you're the furthest from  
Happiness you've ever been  
And you don't know if you'll ever feel  
The happiness that you once did before  
And you're trying to dig deep  
But all you see is ash  
Tried to take a step forward  
But took a couple back  
That's when you busted open  
And all your scars fell out  
You can point the finger  
It won't do you no good  
You can dig a little deeper  
But your story won't be understood  
And you hide behind a mask  
And never tell what's wrong  
But now you have the tool  
To face the demon that you're on  
And you're trying to dig deep  
But all you see is ash  
Tried to take a step forward  
But took a couple back  
That's when you busted open  
And all your scars fell out  
Through all your hard time  
Thank mama's rolling stone  
One day you'll look back and smile  
All the good you've ever known  
And you're trying to dig deep  
But all you see is ash  
Tried to take a step forward  
But took a couple back  
That's when you busted open  
And all your scars fell out  
You're dying just keep trying  
Oh you're dying to keep trying  
Dying dying to keep trying  
Yeah you're dying to keep trying  
Yeah you're dying to keep trying
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So while you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county 'cause you're bad and free
You've got a new horizon it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams they gotta kiss me 'cause I don't get sleep no

Windmill windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking falling down
Love forever love is free

Lining them up-a like ass cracks

Windmill windmill for the land

Ahh


Who's to say what's impossible well they forgot
This world keeps spinning and with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
But in some ways they remain the same


So hard to believe
That we can't eye to eye
A matter of opinion
But my heart can't take this anymore


Let me go let me go
This life just ain't for me no more
Let me go let me go
Everything just feels the same
Let me go let me go
The world is changing and I can't keep up
Let me go let me go
Ohhh


And I can feel my strength just give way
In the presence of your eyes
And now I can't figure out
What it is that made me feel alive
The way all the people look at me
They see right through to the weak inside


So hard to believe
That we can't eye to eye
A matter of opinion
But my heart can't fake this anymore


Let me go let me go
This life just ain't for me no more
Let me go let me go
Everything just feels the same
Let me go let me go
The world is changing and I can't keep up
Let me go let me go
Ohhh


So hard to believe
That we can't eye to eye
A matter of opinion
But my heart can't take this anymore


Let me go let me go
This life just ain't for me no more
Let me go let me go
Everything just feels the same
Let me go let me go
The world is changing and I can't keep up
Let me go let me go
Ohhh


Ahhh
Say hey

Hear the sound of the falling rain

Coming down like an Armageddon flame Hey

The shame

The ones who died without a name

Hear the dogs howling out of key

To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" Hey

And bleed the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time

Another protestor has crossed the line Hey

To find the money's on the other side

Can I get another Amen Amen

There's a flag wrapped around a score of men Hey

A gag a plastic bag on a monument

On holiday

"The representative from California has the floor"

Sieg Heil to the president gasman

Bombs away is your punishment

Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government

Bang bang goes the broken glass and

Kill all the fags that don't agree

Trials by fire setting fire

Is not a way that's meant for me

Just cause just cause because we're outlaws yeah

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

This is our lives on holiday

Notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red
And what the hell is on Joey's head

This is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in

Oh whoa whoa
Oh god I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it time to say it
Goodbye goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it time to say it
Goodbye goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when

Oh whoa whoa
Oh god I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it time to say it
Goodbye goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it time to say it
Goodbye goodbye

I miss that town I miss their faces
You can't erase you can't replace it
I miss it now I can't believe it
So hard to stay too hard to leave it

If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it time to say it
Goodbye goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it time to say it
Goodbye goodbye
Lonely I'm Mr Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely I'm Mr Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely

Yo This one here goes out to all my players out there man
Ya know that got that one good girl who's always been there
Like ya know took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreaming for her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtracking on these few years trying to figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me my whole life came crashin' and I'm so lonely

So lonely I'm Mr Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely I'm Mr Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely

My friends don't understand me they don't know where I've been
They don't know what it's like to be the bad man to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be fated to telling only lies
But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be

I have hours only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like I do and I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

At least not on the outside
But my heart for sure
Is crying crying
Lonely I'm Mr Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely I'm Mr Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely
The dawn is breaking
A light shining through
You're barely waking
And I'm tangled up in you yeah

But I'm open you're closed
Where I follow you'll go
I worry I won't see your face
Light up again

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills my mind
I somehow find you and I collide

I'm quiet you know
You make a first impression
I've found I'm scared to know
I'm always on your mind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the stars refuse to shine
Out of the back you fall in time
I somehow find you and I collide

Don't stop here
I lost my place
I'm close behind

Even the best fall down sometimes
Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
Out of the doubt that fills your mind
You finally find you and I collide
You finally find you and I collide
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends

Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty cutie


A butterfly tattoo right above your navel
Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl come and take a walk with me
You'll be amazed by all the things that I can show you
Take you on a shopping spree
'Cause I'm so into you
Everything I do is to keep you happy
I got a bald head with a beard hate wearing Timbs 'cos the way I walk with a bop
I know I get wild up in the club but when I'm with my shorty I slow that up
If you can stay down like what's up
I gotchu girl it's just us


Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me


I don't know about you but I can't work these heels
I can't even lie they make your legs look good
You got me wondering what's under there under where
Girl put that kaboom in my step
'Cause I done had my share of heartbreaks setbacks setups let downs break ups
Some days I just wanna call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks every time I go to get up
Something keeps reminding me of what I had and what I lost
But it's not my fault I'm aware that I'm hot I'm just saying
Slow down why don't you stay with me tonight
Don't you like this Bentley Coupe Don't you like these 20s on this Denali truck
Take you where you wanna go just wanna get to know you
'Cause I'm so into you


Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me


I know I sound a little crazy right now
But I don't know how to slow it down
It's like every time I see you
I just speed up oh girl
'Cause I can't have you
Girl not gon' lie you got me fiendin'
Tell me what must I do oooh


Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Verse 1: Nelly
Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad yeah
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it
Mmmm

Chorus: Tim McGraw & Nelly
I just can't keep going on living life as this
Hoping that you'll understand
But you don't seem to hear me
And I can't stand


Cause I know what I've done
And I know who I am
And I know what I've lost
And I know I can't get it back
Yeah
And I know what it's like
To be all alone
And you got the key to my heart
And you got me sewed up like a bad habit


I just can't keep going on living life as this
Hoping that you'll understand
But you don't seem to hear me
And I can't stand


Over and over again
Over and over
Over and over again
Over and over again


I just can't keep going on living life as this
Hoping that you'll understand
But you don't seem to hear me
And I can't stand

Mmm yeah
Yeah yeah uh


Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' oh
Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' woah
Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' oh
Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' uh oh


Get it poppin' throwin' bottles like they nothin'
Head to the floor money to the ceiling get it poppin'
So many models I'm tryna figure out who to pop who to pop
I love 'em all the way they make the booty drop the way they make it drop
Been around the world baby oh what a life what a life
Stadiums and arenas to give me space to slice slice
And if you ain't here to party excuse me go home
And tell all your other little friends stay alone


Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' oh

Laugh now cry later boy we still gettin' funds
Make the crowd yell "Crack" and don't stop
And when I'm dead and gone my money keep gettin' bop

And I'm like damn this life is just a damn game


Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' oh
Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' woah
Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' oh
Get it poppin' get it get it poppin' uh oh
Verse 1:
I wanna put you in the bed girl without a pillow
Licking on your body kiss you where it tickle
With me you'll never fiddle
I want you up under me like a fiddle
Nasty naughty sassy classy
Girl you can get it nasty or you can get it romantic
Feel it all up in your stomach just like a hurricane
Wanna eat you like Hannibal do it on the dinner table

Chorus:
Put your booty up put your booty up put your booty up
On my face make me love it make me love it
Make me love it make me love it make me love it
Make me love it make me love it make me love it

Verse 2:
I wanna take you from behind
Then put you on your back girl baby you're mine
Tell me that you love it say it all the time
The neighbors might hear us girl but that's just fine
I wanna seduce you girl I wanna get you wet
I want your love all over me you won't forget
I'm here to please you girl I'm here to make you sweat
I wanna make sure you feel it don't forget

Chorus:
Put your booty up put your booty up put your booty up
On my face make me love it make me love it
Make me love it make me love it make me love it
Make me love it make me love it make me love it

Come on girl put it on me
I wanna make love to you
All night long
Verse 1 Young Jeezy:
When they come to my town Harlem World they hear me
People tuck they chain in 'cause they think that it's a stick up
Things just ain't the same when the gangstas come around
Things just ain't the same when the king come to town
She ain't no Rockaway I get it anytime
And for my VIP n****s I let 'em wait in line
I hit the club with bad b****s mommies and models
They lookin' at me like I'm the one that hit the lotto
'Cause they know I spit that murder-murder murda
Murder-murder murda murder-you-know-who
And that's the reason I got the streets on lock
And that's the reason everybody wants to be like 'C'
Verse 2 Young Jeezy:
Caught another case the lawyers say I'm never learnin'
Caught another charge they yellin' "federal imprisonment"
I'm goin' all out you mothaf*****s know me
Riding in the six hittin' f*****g high speed
Do it for the king love do it for the crown
Do it for the street n**** tear this b***h down
Shawty want a baller they never brought her
I'm goin' all-out the chinchilla's on my collar
I go by the name of the king of the pop
I pump all day the wheels don't stop
Verse 3 Young Jeezy:
Got a hundred grand in the dirty red Phantom
A hundred more in the James Bond Phantom
I got a lot of haters but they worry about the wrong things
I bought a private plane mothaf*****s I ain't tryna board things
I'm gettin' money to come spend it it's just like printed
Radio playin' all hit s*** like we invented
They see that 62 pullin' up they say "Jeezy he's a genius"
I'm just a south side boy they call me Young Jesus
Chorus Akon:
I'm a soul survivor I made it through the fire
I didn't turn to go suicidal
I had me a dream that I can be worth a quarter
If I had me a brick it'd be all water

We pimpin' all over the world
Luda' yeah we pimpin' all over the world
We got them dollar bills y'all

Hahaha


It's bigger than pimpin' baby

I'll make you swallow your pride
It's about the freedom to exchange
It's the It's about the freedom to explore

So that's why I'm just kickin' back
Pimpin' we be rollin' on twenty-inch pimps what

Now I'm flickin' my tongue but I'm speaking my peace
Feelin' kinda deranged but I close my mouth and start to pray
And then I remember that my pimpin' is strong and I can conquer all
It's not about the cars it's not about the gold
But my pimpin' has been strong since age twelve years old
Like a young nigga inducted into the gang
See I never found time for the pleasure or the pain
I read the TV Guide and I told you every channel
You could listen to the radio and I'd tell you every handle
From Hip-Hop and R&B to funk and soul
The biggest pimp of my time is who made that call
Now they call me Luda rich in game so they people respect me
Now they call me rich they call me a player but I'm just a pimp

Mad more than the teacher but I got sum' to show for it

I'm that nigga named Joe Ridin' hundred spokes
Could you buy that kinda car bitch hell no
See I'm the nigga that didn't buy your boyfriend clothes
Gave your punk ass the key to the candy rolls

Lil' mama walkin' on a double wide 
Saddle all up in the sky

It ain't no secret to me
What it take to make you choose me
They come through CeeLo tree blow hundred on some new shoes
Run on and lose your mind all night

Talkin' 'bout the way you wanna handle me
Girl you just don't know what you could do for me


Sugar sugar sugar daddy
Sugar sugar sugar daddy
Sugar sugar sugar daddy
Sugar sugar sugar daddy

And the award for the best liar goes to you
For making me believe that you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech oh
How about a round of applause
A standing ovation oh
But you put on quite a show


Really had me going but now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing that was quite a show
Very entertaining but it's over now but it's over now
Go on and take a bow


Grab your clothes and get gone get gone
You better hurry up before the sprinklers come on come on
Talking' 'bout "Girl I love you you're the one"
This just looks like a rerun what


Really had me going but now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing that was quite a show
Very entertaining but it's over now but it's over now
Go on and take a bow
Oh ←That's it

I don't need to be anything other
Than a prison guard's son
I don't need to be anything other
Than a specialist's son
I don't have to be anyone other
Than the birth of two souls in one
Part of where I'm going is knowing where I'm coming from


I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me


I'm surrounded by liars everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by impostors everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by identity crisis everywhere I turn
Am I the only one who noticed
I can't be the only one who's learned


I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me


Can I have everyone's attention please
If you're not like this and that you're gonna have to leave
I came from the mountain the crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody


I don't want to be
Anything other than what I've been trying to be lately
All I have to do is think of me and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I've got to do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't want to be anything other than me
Yup here are the uncensored lyrics of "Mockingbird" by Eminem:

Yeah I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey what daddy always tell you
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad even when you smile even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying wipe them tears
Daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah
But he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world
When it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise mama's gonna be alright
And if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad haha
Beauty queen of only eighteen

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I’ve had you so many times but somehow

Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved

Alone in your car
I know that goodbye means nothing at all

Come back and never leave
Show you that I'll be faithful
And I'm still in love with you

I don’t mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Chorus x2
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby my baby it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I try to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go alone

I try to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Incomplete incomplete oh yeah

TIP coming live from the VIP
Hear my life but really I'm just PIMP
And everything I do I do it BIG
Rep my city well it's really just the A
Can't forget the home so I gotta shout the Bay
Had niggas hatin' on me since I wasn't what 17
Who you know blew up and made a million at 18
I'm on fire and they can't put me out
They can't hold me down I told you that no doubt
Hundred round drum let 'em know who rung yeah
King in the South by the way of the slums


Bring 'em out bring 'em out bring 'em out bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrels in your mouth
Bring 'em out bring 'em out ayy
Bring 'em out bring 'em out ayy
Bring 'em out bring 'em out ayy

Got a six-foot seven-foot eight-foot bunch
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You don't wanna start Weezy 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood but what's a world without enigma
Two girls one cup I'm a boss like Topple
Leave a hater's head spinning like that chick Linda Blair
I'm on a money-making mission but I party like a rockstar
Flyin' down two-eighty but I'm highway patrol cars
Got a trunk full of work and a clip full of eight
I'm from Hollygrove the letting where Satan stay
Red flag on the left side it's 5 Poppin' 6 droppin'
See a foe let it be known we crippin' ain't no stoppin'

And I know my firepower can't be tamed
And I'm the wild card the niggas need to deal with
This ain't the game the nigga's been ill we still here
We're supposed to be moved quietly
I mean the game it needs change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Our arms are too short to box with God
But Jesus' arms were stretchier than anybody
You can't call it I got the whole city on
And if I don't get no better than this then that's fine


Bring 'em out bring 'em out bring 'em out bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrels in your mouth
Bring 'em out bring 'em out ayy
Bring 'em out bring 'em out ayy
Bring 'em out bring 'em out ayy
Bring 'em out bring 'em out ayy

Chorus:

I've got another confession to make  
I'm your fool  
Everyone's got their chains to break  
Holdin' you  
Were you born to resist or be abused  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  

Are you gone and onto someone new  
I needed somewhere to hang my head  
Without your noose  
You gave me something that I didn't have  
But had no use  
I was too weak to give in  
Too strong to lose  
My heart is under arrest again  
But I break loose  
My head is giving me life or death  
But I can't choose  
I swear I'll never give in  
I refuse  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Has someone taken your faith  
It's real the pain you feel  
The life the love you'd die to heal  
The hope that starts the broken hearts  
You trust you must  
Confess  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
I've got another confession my friend  
I'm no fool  
I'm getting tired of starting again  
Somewhere new  
Were you born to resist or be abused  
I swear I'll never give in  
I refuse  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you  
Has someone taken your faith  
Its real the pain you feel  
The life the love you'd die to heal  
The hope that starts the broken hearts  
You trust you must  
Confess  
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you

I will provide the lyrics to "Inside Your Heaven" by Carrie Underwood without any additional commentary censorship or information below:


I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess its right its so amazing
Everytime I see you I'm alive
You're all I got You lift me up
The sun and moonlight follows thee


Should have known
When you roll
Should have known
Inside your heaven

I think I've died and gone to heaven
Everywhere you are is where I wanna be
Caught up in the touch you gave me
The faith you gave me baby
I want nothing more

Should have known
When you roll
Should have known
Inside your heaven


Take me to the place you cry
From your joy and your grace
Let me die inside your arms
I'll never be apart when I'm inside your heaven

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far


Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
Because of you I am afraid


I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile a laugh every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with


Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
Because of you I am afraid


I watched you die I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing


Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you I don't know how to let anyone else in


I hope that helps

Truth is I'm tired
Options are few
I'm trying to pray
But where are you
I'm all churched out
Hurt and abused
I can't fake
What's left to do


Truth is I'm weak
No strength to fight
No tears to cry
Even if I tried
But still my soul
Refuses to die
One touch-will complete me
And dry the tears from my eyes


Truth is I'm tired
Options are few
I'm trying to pray
But where are you
I'm all churched out
Hurt and abused
I can't fake
What's left to do


I know you're able
And I know you can
Save through the fire
With your mighty hand
But even if you don't
My hope is you alone


I know the sorrow
And I know the hurt
Would all go away
If you just say the word
But even if you don't
My hope is you alone
I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Beautiful Soul" by Jesse McCartney:

I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul

I know that you are something special
To you I'd be always faithful
I want to be what you always needed
Then I hope you'll see the heart in me

I'll be your I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

And I dropped out I burned up
I fought my way back from the dead
Twice shy did you see me coming
Ill always give you what you need
I'll be your I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life
ohhhh
The greatest fan of your life

ohhhh yeah
Don't let me down
I'll be your I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

I'll be your I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

ohh
The greatest fan of your life
ohh
The greatest fan of your life
Verse 1:
It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes things get more comfortable
Everything is going right
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool

Chorus:
We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain
Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown oh
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool

Verse 2:
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool

Chorus:
We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain
Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown oh
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool

Bridge:
Yeah I know we're cool
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool

Outro:
If you're happy then I'm happy too

I'm talkin' plates of the food that you bring in
Hit it raw from the back I'ma push your wig in
Came in the door so now it's time to let the games begin
I'm hopin' I'm wishin' my tongue and that pussy mix in
I can't help it babygirl damn it I can't
If you lit the fire then I'm bound to fan it
Your bitch'll leave you home alone and like Macaulay Culkin
Life's a gamble so before I roll the dice I'ma thank you

Gettin' this motherf*cker off right now n*gga

I know you don't want it with me
You said you gonna come and get me uh-huh
But I got a gun that's very big uh-huh
It pointed at your head and that's a good reason to get up outta control


I'm in front of the pack when it comes to combat
You don't wanna put me to the test mayne I'll mark that
I drop bombs like Hiroshima it's your worst nightmare
You don't wanna step to me cause you don't fight fair
I'm a tank with a M16 I'm a soldier
You a featherweight I'm big dog I'll fold ya
Matter fact I'll lift ya snuff you then throw ya
I'm direct dog I'll shoot you on the motorola
I'm a ghetto terrorist spontaneous combustable
You get too close to me I'll turn you to an animal
Savage out of control no doubt
This little n*gga 50 cent tryin' to be like us




See I got enemies I didn't know I had
I guess it's cause I'm getting money getting cash
I keep my guns sharp and I don't hesitate to blast
It's a shame how they wanna take a good thing and turn it bad
They want Havoc and 50 to beef so they can get it on
When all is initiated I'ma put them where they belong
You lil' n*ggas ain't soldiers you scared
I bump heads with the best and they scared

 


You can see what I got homey I ain't gotta show off
I'm a gangsta slash rapper I'm a show off
I put a clip in the burner turn the roof off
Send a shout-out to your block that's how I get off
I'm like Uzi Vert the magazines change
Every time I shoot n*gga look at the brain
I'm living proof that crime pay you suckas wanna try me
I'm a mob gettin' richer by the day that's no lying
In the club on the dance floor n*ggas be sweatin'
Grown men wearin' vests I bump to they chest
I'm a real n*gga when you see me you know
I'm the one they try to be but they just can't be

 


50 Cent
Yeah Outta Control yeah finna' bounce now ya heard me
Mobb Deep
Real talk bye bye one love peace
Verse 1:
She said "I've seen you in here before"
I said "I've been here a time or two"
She said "Hello my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
And you're the only cowboy in this place
So if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face"

Chorus:
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

Verse 2:
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big and one small
They raised a fuss and then they challenged us
To a game of eight-ball

Chorus:
I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

Bridge:
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says "You can't do this boy"
But my pride says "Oh yes you can"

Chorus:
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
But I'm still a hangin' in there ain't I guys
So don't let me bother you
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

Outro:
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

Oh oh
He said "You don't
Have to take your panties off
Just pull 'em to the side"
If you want to ride on the hot ride
But you gotta be a lady first

The fellas looking jealous 'cause the ladies looking lovely
I'm tryin to get my hands on her um bubbly bubbly
Money on deck pockets on full
All my homies on the way and one's name is Dre cool
Got a Georgia peach with a Georgia weave
In her stripper shoes you should see the Georgia scene
Sexy Caramel you know who you are
Dressed in the Giddy with more class than a Jaguar
With a body lookin' like she's been sculpted by the Lord
Every time she bounced it boy she got more for

Verse 1:
Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

Pre-Chorus:
I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But i think we should take it slow

Chorus:
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Verse 2:
Take it slow ohh ohh
This time we'll take it slow ohh ohh
This time we'll take it slow

Pre-Chorus:
Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return maybe another fight
Maybe we'll both be wrong
But who ever knows the way
We'll put it back together ohh

Chorus:
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Bridge:
Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return maybe another fight
But what ever you do
Don't break your heart

Verse 3:
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Outro:
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Yes here are the uncensored lyrics of "We Be Burnin'" by Sean Paul:


Forces dem a work
But we a get di perks di tough get goin'
When di goin' get tough
Well some seh them a gangsta
Real bad man nah watch nuh face
Dem seh dem a kill man
But di weed dem a blaze


I and I a bun a next chalice
And if we get stopped by di cops inna road
Police come and dem can't do nuttin'
Drive on catch me if you cyaan
Forces just have to move on
When di herb shop lock stock pile and barrel
And di most high bless we with nuff we get from di peril
So betta u legalize it
And don't criticize it
And I will advertise it


Some boy nuh know this
Them only come around like tourist
On di beach wid a few club sodas
Bedtime stories
And pose like them name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals a no back-tourest


Forces dem a work
But we a get di perks di tough get goin'
When di goin' get tough
Well some seh them a gangsta
Real bad man nah watch nuh face
Dem seh dem a kill man
But di weed dem a blaze


Well anytime them see Jah
Him a di girls dem sugar
Sweet Them a go


Forces dem a work
But we a get di perks di tough get goin'
When di goin' get tough
Well some seh them a gangsta
Real bad man nah watch nuh face
Dem seh dem a kill man
But di weed dem a blaze
Verse 1:
She's cold and she's cruel 
But she knows what she's doin' 
She pushed me in the pool 
At our last school reunion 

She laughs at my dreams 
But I dream about her laughter 
Strange as it seems 
She's the one I'm after 

Chorus:
'Cause she's bittersweet 
She knocks me off of my feet 
And I can't help myself 
I don't want anyone else 

She's a mystery 
She's too much for me 
But I keep comin' back for more 
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for 

Verse 2:
She can't keep a secret 
For more than an hour 
She runs on 100 proof attitude power 
And the more she ignores me 
The more I adore her 
What can I do 
I'd do anything for her 

Chorus:
'Cause she's bittersweet 
She knocks me off of my feet 
And I can't help myself 
I don't want anyone else 

She's a mystery 
She's too much for me 
But I keep comin' back for more 
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for 

Bridge:
She can cut you like a knife 
If the fight becomes the fire 
On a wire between will and what will be 
She's a maniac maniac at your love 

And she's driving me insane 
But I love it and I feel the pain 
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh 

Chorus:
'Cause she's bittersweet 
She knocks me off of my feet 
And I can't help myself 
I don't want anyone else 

She's a mystery 
She's too much for me 
But I keep comin' back for more 
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for 

Outro:
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
Verse 1:
Omarion and the beat goes
Boom boom boom

Girl it's your body you-you-you
Like the way you're moving you-you-you
Got me hypnotized mesmerized
The way your body rollin' hey
Round and round let's go

Verse 2:

Girl let's get it on baby let's
We'll be hearing that moaning
Sound all night long yeah we will
I'll make you feel like you-you-you
You're in heaven oh oh oh oh
So let's do it now let's do it
Round and round hey
Girl you look good want to back that azz up
You's a fine motherf***** want to back that azz up
Call me big daddy when you back that azz up
Hoe who is you playing with back that azz up
Girl you looks good won't you back that azz up
You'se a fine motherf***** won't you back that azz up
Call me big daddy when you back that azz up
Hoe who is you playing with back that azz up

If it wasn't for the money cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder hey
Would you still want me Want you
Would you still be calling me Still calling you
Would you still be loving me I'll be loving you
Wish you would answer me
I-I-I'm just being real you know
It's the way I feel


I wonder if I wasn't famous
Would they even entertain us
And if I never make it
Will they recognize I played it
Like I'm on my death bed
Will they remember me as vividly as the eyes that fed
Beg for me plead for me scream for me
Like I scream for TV
I'm only a fiend for these streets
Jealous motherfuckers telling me to leave
Cause I burn something up on the corner
And they want in but I'm no G
So they just send shots through the window
Treat my first like my last and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's all or nothing ain't no in-between
Fucked being seventeen nigga I'm high as a king
And they wonder why I keep it gutter
'Cause the skyscraper peaks can't hold the weight of my pain
And it's pourin' like Niagara convincin' us all to buy Prada
But I'm used to all of that
I'm from where niggas pull triggers instead of talking behind your back
And ladies that don't grow up to be mothers
Got a better chance of platinum plaques than abortions
So we take precautions like condoms and crews
When it's goin' down who you calling
Would you stand by my side
Would you ride
Would you die for me
And if you lied to me could you hide from me
Cause to live in this life
You must be prepared to die huh


If it wasn't for the money cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder hey
Would you still want me Want you
Would you still be calling me Still calling you
Would you still be loving me I'll be loving you
Wish you would answer me
I-I-I'm just being real you know
It's the way I feel


Some say that love is
Do you believe
I believe
And some say that love is not for real
But I know
And I wonder will he keep me happy
I wonder will he be for real
I wonder when I am his lady
Will he still love me
Will I be enough

If it wasn't for the money cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder hey
Would you still want me Want you
Would you still be calling me Still calling you
Would you still be loving me I'll be loving you
Wish you would answer me
I-I-I'm just being real you know
It's the way I feel


You know I got that dough
I'm the one they come to see yeah
Got them cars and fancy clothes
And dreams that they be chasing
But you my good luck charm
How's your love so good
I'm able to buy you all the finest things
"Like Gucci and Dom" Oh no
We'll be shining anyway
And if the rain starts pouring
I guarantee forever and always
We'll stay together for always


If it wasn't for the money cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder hey
Would you still want me Want you
Would you still be calling me Still calling you
Would you still be loving me I'll be loving you
Wish you would answer me
I-I-I'm just being real you know
It's the way I feel
I'm sprung
 Dawg she got me got me doin' things I would never do
 If you ain't been I'm tellin' you

 Dawg she got me got me doin' things I would never do
 If you ain't been I'm tellin' you I'm sprung 
 
 Chorus: T-Pain

I guess he's an Xbox
And I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you and so I went and let you
Blow my mind
Your sweet moving the smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind
 


Hey soul sister
Ain't that Mr Mister on the radio stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight
 


Just in time I'm so glad you have a one track mind like me
You gave my love direction a game show love connection
We can't deny
I'm so obsessed my heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
 


Hey soul sister
Ain't that Mr Mister on the radio stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight
 


The way you can't cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangsta I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me
 


Hey soul sister
Ain't that Mr Mister on the radio stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Absolutely here are the uncensored lyrics to "Mississippi Girl" by Faith Hill:

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy 'bout me

I've been a waitress a teacher a Jackson hole dude ranch hand
I've shoveled stalls pumped gasoline and fried chicken in a frying pan

I've been a Nashville songwriter session singer and a star
And I wouldn't change a thing 'bout my journey anymore

I'm a Mississippi girl I swear to the world
There ain't another place that I'd rather be
I'm proud of my roots and where I'm from
But 'round here I'm just a mile-a-minute half-city and half-country

I'm a Mississippi girl inside my heart
There's a bayou rhythm that plays
I'm a Mississippi girl I'll just go on and say
I love New York and LA but dang it I'm a Mississippi girl

When I need a place to run to
I know just where to go
Back to my roots down where it's real
Where the catfish and the honeysuckle grow

I could wear the world over
Like a loose-fitting robe
But my heart just wouldn't be in it
For a Mississippi girl's heart just wouldn't be in it

I'm a Mississippi girl I swear to the world
There ain't another place that I'd rather be
I'm proud of my roots and where I'm from
But 'round here I'm just a mile-a-minute half-city and half-country

I'm a Mississippi girl inside my heart
There's a bayou rhythm that plays
I'm a Mississippi girl I'll just go on and say
I love New York and LA but dang it I'm a Mississippi girl

I'm a Mississippi girl I swear to the world
There ain't another place that I'd rather be
I'm proud of my roots and where I'm from
But 'round here I'm just a mile-a-minute half-city and half-country

I'm a Mississippi girl inside my heart
There's a bayou rhythm that plays
I'm a Mississippi girl I'll just go on and say
I love New York and LA but dang it I'm a Mississippi girl

I'm a Mississippi girl yeah I'm a Mississippi girl
Oh yeah I'm a Mississippi girl
A Mississippi girl

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Luda
Yeah What's the matter with you Override Override Yeah
Disturbing tha peace in this muh'fucker


I'ma keep it movin' be classy and graceful
Haters wanna stop me see me dead eraseful
Let me get specific they keep on pacin' and pacin'
But when it comes to these rhymes I'ma make 'em nauseasin' 
They yawnin' they sleepin' they so damn bored
They don't know what they talkin' 'bout they can't walk in my Jord'
And even if they could they wouldn't know what to do
It's like them jackers in that "Black Movie" they confuse
That's why they gettin' booed you wanna battle Don't try
I leave you cryin' like Phantom of the Opera and dye
You don't wanna do it I'm prepared to ruin your career
Don't try to bite my style 'cause I'm the original player
You wanna know the rest check the credits and files
Number one spot and stayin' there awhile


Ain't nobody else hot just me and my clique
I'm the number one stunna yeah the one they wanna get with
I'm the king of the hill top of the heap
Number one spot and stayin' there for weeks


I'm like a Russian mobster drinkin' distilled vodka
'Til I'm under the field with Hoffa it's real
Packin' steel knuckle game can't be touched
Riches peso's and pounds and plus
I'm in the club on the low sippin' Moet
I got a healthy stash because I hold down the trap
Ay we make it snow in the South so what you talkin' 'bout
I'm tryna put a million in my bank account
'Fore the age of 26 'cause ain't got no other options
Just more subpoenas and felons watchin'
Every move I make every step I take
They all tryna infiltrate and investigate
But I ain't stressin' y'all gon' have to catch me
And stop me from makin' history with hits yeah


Ain't nobody else hot just me and my clique
I'm the number one stunna yeah the one they wanna get with
I'm the king of the hill top of the heap
Number one spot and stayin' there for weeks


"Number one one one one
Number number one one one one
Number one one one one"
Stayin' there for weeks

When you're workin' with a monster
You gotta know how to monster mash
I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes yeah
You've built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic the beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye
Verse 1:

Ain’t nobody supposed to know 
So I creep yeah creeping and I saw you
Grindin’ with a girl that I’ve never seen before

Verse 3:

Without being disrespectful
Damn she’s a sexy bitch a queen 
Damn let’s all bow down and pay homage

Chorus: 
I’m lookin’ for a cutie 
A real big ol’ ghetto booty 
I really like your kitty cat 
And if you let me hit it I would never call you back

If your lovin's strong gonna give my all to you

At night I think of you

Si te pido un beso ven dámelo yo sé que estás pensándolo

Llevo tiempo intentando hablar contigo
Y es que no sé qué decirte
Solo sé que me perturba verte
Y no te imaginas lo que siento
Lo que te estoy proponiendo
Es un abismo enorme así que piénsalo

Te imprimo un beso y me voy en tu boca
Si es cuestión de confesar siempre pené que te gusté
Quizás no fueron las palabras precisas
O tal vez no supe expresarme muy bien
Pero tú comprende que un hombre ajeno te soñé
Y no soy un santo tampoco un diablo soy tan solo un hombre

Si te pido un beso ven dámelo yo sé que estás pensándolo
Me has mirado
Dando por sentado
Que ya estaba enamorado
Y quizás tienes razón
Pero el amor es como el viento
No se puede ver pero puede sentirse
Así que dime si me quieres

O te vas o me voy o nos vamos los dos

Si te pido un beso ven dámelo yo sé que estás pensándolo

Bluntly just swagg'in doing my two step
I done walked in Can't even see my haters
So let them talk Cause' I'm in the city shining money stacked as high as I can
Uhh yeah you know I be getting bank Watch how far the hoes get to leaning
Trying to get a glimpse of chain and I gleaming
While I'm shining mayne'
I come up hard but that ain't nothing new
We used to sell dope thats all we wanted to do
Hey looky here man I'm a made man
A made man you understand
Uhhh


I got a rubber-band bankroll in my hand right now
Lemme tell you one thang lil' man what
Money ain't a thing now no no
And I'm never gon' change up
Hoes climbing in my ride jealous eyes can't hide
But there's something that they don't know what
They'll never touch me cause' they might be chasing the wrong doe
Excuse me all eyes on me
Got these fakers showing love seems the more I get the more they hate on me
It's a shame that a family tree I had to break
One of these fakin'-ass n***as I can't wait
To see 'em all standin' in line what
Just to get close enough to touch my what
You already know that's all I'm gon' say
But listen to this b**ch you can miss me wit' that


I'm in the club posted up up got my arms folded
Bluntly just swagg'in doing my two steps
I done walked in Can't even see my haters
So let them talk Cause I'm in this b***h shining money stacked as high as I can
Uhh yeah you know I be getting bank Watch how far the hoes get to leaning
Trying to get a glimpse of chain and I gleaming
While I'm shining mayne'
I come up hard but that ain't nothing new
We used to sell dope that's all we wanted to do
Hey looky here man I'm a made man
A made man you understand
Uhhh
These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you I love you I love you I love you
There's no other way to better say
I love you I love you

Read some books and bought some books
To train myself to hear your call
And jumped out of my perfect world
To see my world had shattered shattered

I'd recommend getting out of town
A little love a little bit of love
Dreaming dreaming is all good fun
But praying just to stay alive

In my head were many deadlines
And stresses that seemed to fly by
I flew around personal issues
And tried to find something to satisfy me

I could try to put this all behind me
Pick myself up and start again
I'd rather find someone who can remind me
Of the one who wrote this of my friend

 I love you I love you I love you I love you
There's no other way to better say
I love you I love you I love you I love you
There's nothing better than this better than this ooh
I love you I love you I love you I love you
There's no other way to say I love you
I love you I love you I love you I love you
Nothing better than this ooh nothing better than this oh-no oh-oh

Verse 1:
Ya lookin' just a little too hard at me
Standin' just a little too close to me
Ya sayin' not quite enough to me
Ya sippin' just a little too slow for me
No doubt ya playin' real cool homie
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me
Trippin' trippin'
A little more than I should be
So let ya self go and get right with me

Chorus:
I'm about to sign you up
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right get right

Do you want more Do you want more
I am sure we can get right

'Cause we're smokin' just a little too much for me
We're dancin' just a little too close to me
You know comfort is what I need
So I'll let ya self go and get right with me

Verse 2:
I'm like an icicle I can be a little cold
But you know I'm still feminine and still a little bold

If you're lucky boy I'll let you call me your baby
If you're good to me I'll make you my baby
Don't you know you gotta set the tone
If you want to touch my body just let me know

I'll do my best to provide the uncensored lyrics of "Daughters" by John Mayer:


I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me


Fathers be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers be good to your daughters too


Oh you see that skin
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
So fathers be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers be good to your daughters too


Boys you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without the warmth from
A woman's good good heart


On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the god and weight of her world
So fathers be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers be good to your daughters too
So mothers be good to your daughters
So mothers be good to your daughters
So mothers be good to your daughters
So mothers be good to your daughters
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "True" by Ryan Cabrera:

I won't talk I won't breathe  
I won't move till you finally see  
That you belong with me  
You might think I don't look  
But deep inside in the corner of my mind  
I'm attached to you mmm  
I'm weak it's true  
'Cause I'm afraid to know the answer  
Do you want me too  
'Cause my heart keeps falling faster  
I've waited all my life to cross this line  
To the only thing that's true  
So I will not hide  
It's time to try anything to be with you  
All my life I've waited  
This is true  
You don't know what you do every time you walk into the room  
I'm afraid to move  
I'm weak it's true  
I'm just scared to know the ending  
Do you see me too  
Do you even know you met me  
I've waited all my life to cross this line  
To the only thing that's true  
So I will not hide  
It's time to try anything to be with you  
All my life I've waited  
This is true  
I know when I go I'll be on my way to you  
The way that's true  
I've waited all my life to cross this line  
To the only thing that's true  
So I will not hide  
It's time to try anything to be with you  
All my life I've waited  
This is true  
This is true  
I've waited all my life for this is true  
This is true  
This is true  
This is true
Thank you for clarifying your request Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Numb/Encore" by Jay-Z and Linkin Park:

Thank you thank you thank you you're far too kind

Now can I get an encore do you want more

Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy

So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin' for

After me there shall be no more

So for one last time nigga make some noise

Who you know fresher than Hov' Riddle me that

The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at

Can't none of y'all mirror me back

Yeah hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime

I'm young HO rap's Grateful Dead

Back to take over the globe now break bread

I'm in Boeing jets Global Express

Out the country but the blueberry still connect

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck

But when you Young what the fuck you expect Yup yup

Grand openin' grand closin'

God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again

Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen

just draw off inspiration

So you gon' see you can't replace him

With cheap imitations for these generations

Now can I get an encore do you want more

Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy

So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin' for

After me there shall be no more

So for one last time nigga make some noise

What the hell are you waiting for

Look what you made me do look what I made for you

Knew if I paid my dues how will they pay you

When you first come in the game they try to play you

Then you drive a couple of hits look how they wave to you

From all the hatin' that's the one they designated

To be the one and only unprecedented

T-shirt to blazers occupations said you one of the greatest

They ain't saying you nothin' new

Everybody know you're as good as dead

Yeah what I'ma do now

Can I get an encore do you want more

Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy

So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waitin' for

After me there shall be no more

So for one last time nigga make some noise

What the hell are you waiting for
How long am I supposed to live with this hurtful feeling
Has this become a shadow of what we once had
You said it takes time but I can't leave it alone
I want you to see it now tonight
We've tried so hard to understand
But we can't break each other's defenses down
It's like we're running out of time
As I'm driving I'm counting mile markers
So much to say but I don't know where to start
Back to the days when we were young and harmless
When you and I were far apart
We've tried so hard to understand
But we can't break each other's defenses down
It's like we're running out of time
If you love me come and take my hand tonight
Let's take flight together we can go
To the speed of sound
If you love me come and take my hand tonight
Together we can go to the speed of sound
