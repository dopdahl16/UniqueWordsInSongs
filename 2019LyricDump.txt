Took it so far to keep you close keep you close
I was afraid to leave you on your own

I said I'd catch you if you fall fall
And if they laugh then fuck 'em all all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky does it ever get lonely
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why yeah I don't know why

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries hundred tries
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine mine
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall fall
And if they laugh then fuck 'em all all
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky does it ever get lonely
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me

When the morning comes  
When we see what we've become  
In the cold light of daywe're a flame in the wind  
Not the fire that we've begun  
Every argument every word we can't take back  
'Cause with all that has happened

When the evening falls  
And I'm left there with my thoughts  
And the image of you being with someone else  
Well that's eating me up inside  
But we ran our course we pretended we're okay  
Now if we jump together at least we can swim  
Far away from the wreck we made  

Then only for a minute  
I want to change my mind  
'Cause this just don't feel right to me  
I want to raise your spirits

I will go go go  

So I'll go I'll go  
I will go go go  

Lately I've been I've been thinking  
I want you to be happier I want you to be happier  

Even though I might not like this  
But I think that you'll be happier I want you to be happier  

Then only for a minute

Longin' for a change
And in the bad times I fear myself


Tell me something boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void
Or do you need more

In all the good times I find myself
Longing for a change
And in the bad times I fear myself

We're far from the shallow now


In the shallow shallow

Verse 1:
Yeah Bitch I'm outside every day
Posted with a Glock who gon' jump outta the bushes and try to play
I keep this shit real every lil' nigga round me poppin' pills
Niggas havin' beef with me we gon' get that shit resolved now
I'm just tryna vibe and stack my money to the sky
All these haters tryna knock me off my pivot but I'm alive
Say you wanna solve the problem but let's not politic let's do it
I don't give a fuck who tryna talk to me niggas know that we can't chew it

Chorus:
They call me DaBaby I run this shit they playin' hopscotch
And I been servin' fiends all day whip it 'til the pot lock
I'm pullin' up it's a chopper a kilo and a Glock
And shit got real I'm forgettin' names inside the drop

Verse 2:
I put blue cheese in my pocket took off in a private rocket
I know them niggas ain't believe me now they pointin' fingers talkin'
It's kinda hard to understand me when I talk fast
I'm comin' from the bottom man nobody gave me nothin'
When you see me in person I look like a millionaire
Standin' next to Diddy with a billion in cash nigga
Got a penthouse on both coasts pH balance
Niggas crossin' over the line of scrimmage they can't handle it

Chorus:
They call me DaBaby I run this shit they playin' hopscotch
And I been servin' fiends all day whip it 'til the pot lock
I'm pullin' up it's a chopper a kilo and a Glock
And shit got real I'm forgettin' names inside the drop

You good T-Minus


Niggas been countin' me out

The game is off balance I'm back on my sh*t
The Bentley is dirty my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it you all on my d*ck
I'm all in my bag this hard as it get
I do not snort powder I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends I love them to death
I got a few mil but not all of them rich
What goin' through your mind It's really a vibe
I'm playin' for keeps see how I'm doin' 'em greasy
I'm greetin' the season I'm duckin' the snakes
Ain't bleedin' the block I'm servin' the base

I might just have one put his d*ck in a spiral
Head in a *oke I'm silent like choir

I caution you that the lyrics to "Beautiful Crazy" may contain language and/or themes that some people may find offensive With that being said here are the uncensored lyrics to the song by Luke Combs:


Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever to get ready so she's never on time for anything
But she gets that come-get-me that look in her eye
Well it kinda scares me the way that she drives me wild
But she drives me wild


Beautiful crazy she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me


She makes plans for the weekend can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind says "let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

Beautiful crazy she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me


She's unpredictable unforgettable
It's unusual unbelievable
How I'm such a fool yeah I'm such a fool for her


Beautiful crazy she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me


Beautiful crazy she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you oh
Easier said than done

Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

The one

Listening to my heart instead of my head

Verse 1:
Pour me pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more hell naw
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Pour me pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

Chorus:
Don't wanna think about her or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar and sing without her
Don't wanna keep on feeling lonely hands need holding
Sunset don't show pity on me
I'm allergic to the memories

Verse 2:
Pour me pour me another shot
I don't wanna remember but I can't forget
What she did what she do
The day she left pour me another
Well I'm finished with the one and I'm done with the two
But I'm feeling real good with the three lines deep
So fill it on up let's tear it down
And give it up for the next go round 

Chorus:
Don't wanna think about her or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar and sing without her
Don't wanna keep on feeling lonely hands need holding
Sunset don't show pity on me
I'm allergic to the memories 

Bridge:
I might as well keep on wouldn't be the first time
Holding back what I really feel inside
And I don't wanna be a downer all alone
No whiskey glasses no smoke in the air tonight 

Chorus:
Don't wanna think about her or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar and sing without her
Don't wanna keep on feeling lonely hands need holding
Sunset don't show pity on me
I'm allergic to the memories
Right there's a couple of labels and a request for no commentary or additional information so I'm going to ignore that part and just provide you with the uncensored lyrics:


Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land but it ain't my ground
This is God's country


We pray for rain and thank Him when it's fallin'
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in a plate I guess that's why they call it
God's country


I saw the light in a sunrise sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistle in the wind that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country


We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again because we're proud to be
From God's country


I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When it's my time lay me six feet deep in
God's country


We pray for rain and thank Him when it's fallin'
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in a plate I guess that's why they call it
God's country

I stand by the river with the fellow saints 
A campin' out all night and I shake with the Lord
Finding souls where the wind don't blow
Till I'm lost in Your hold and beautiful 


I saw the light in a sunrise sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistle in the wind that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
Verse 1:
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again and I wonder
What's on your mind And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake

Chorus:
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face
And my friend said "I know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go
It'll be alright"

Verse 2:
So I asked to look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right but it was messing with my head
And everything deleted like the past yeah it was gone
And when I touched your face I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just want to stay

Chorus:
And my friend said "I know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go
It'll be alright"
And my friend said "I know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go
It'll be alright"
And my friend said "I know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go
It'll be alright"
It'll be alright

Even though it hurts
I can't slow down
Wall's are closing in
And I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow 
Echo in my mind
Always telling me 
What I should find

It's a close cold frozen winter
Lookin' for a little bit of summer
But who wants to be a loner
In this world all alone
In this world all alone
I get so impatient
When you're not around
I get so frustrated
When I'm underground

Cosmo's callin' me
To brighten up my night
I'm livin' in a daydream
Only one thing in sight

It's a close cold frozen winter
Lookin' for a little bit of summer
But who wants to be a loner
In this world all alone
In this world all alone

Don't hide
Don't hide
Don't hide don't hide
Don't hide don't hide

It's a close cold frozen winter
Lookin' for a little bit of summer
But who wants to be a loner
In this world all alone
In this world all alone

It's a close cold frozen winter 
Lookin' for a little bit of summer 
But who wants to be a loner 
In this world all alone 
In this world all alone
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low
Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know ooh oh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong oh You say I am Yours
And I believe I oh I believe I
What You say of me I
Oh I believe

Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure God and You'll have every victory ooh oh
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong oh You say I am Yours
And I believe I oh I believe I
What You say of me I
Oh I believe oh

Oh I believe I yes I believe I
What You say of me I
Oh I believe oh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong oh You say I am Yours
And I believe I oh I believe I
What You say of me I
Oh I believe oh
All my life been hustlin' and
Tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs
And my pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons
Stocks and bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed
Get up and leave
A climber and a sadist yeah
Are you ready for the sequel
Ain't ready for the latest
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose boo hoo
Hey look ma I made it
Hey look ma I made it
Everything's comin' up aces aces
And if it's a dream don't wake me don't wake me
I said hey look ma I made it
Friends are happy for me
Or they're honeysuckle phonies
They celebrate my medals
Or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers
While these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust
Then trust me you'll be lonely oh
Are you ready for the sequel
Ain't ready for the latest
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose boo hoo
Hey look ma I made it
Hey look ma I made it
Everything's comin' up aces aces
And if it's a dream don't wake me don't wake me
I said hey look ma I made it
The Mrs is a morphine
And forever we're humble
It's when disaster comes
And you head for the hills
A temporary escape
Ain’t nothin' gonna kill you so
Are you ready for the sequel
Ain't ready for the latest
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose boo hoo
Hey look ma I made it
Hey look ma I made it
Everything's comin' up aces aces
And if it's a dream don't wake me don't wake me
I said hey look ma I made it
Hey look ma I made it
I said hey look ma I made it
I said hey look ma I made it
Hey

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now but no I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I try
You don't believe it we do this every time


Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away but we're running in circles
Run away run away


I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away but we're running in circles


Run away run away run away
I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I say so I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special special
But it was just the sex though the sex though
And I still hear the echoes the echoes
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go
Let it go


I don't know what to say I'll say it anyway
I'll never be sorry I'll never be sorry
For staying up late with salmiakki with salmiakki
Confessing our love in the dark
So I don't take the blame run away but we're running in circles


I blame it on you I blame it on you
Just can't be happy no I can't be happy no


Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now but no I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I try
You don't believe it we do this every time


Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
Comin' in hot forty-hour week  
Dirt-covered jeans that summer heat  
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road  
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones  
Smoke rollin' out the window  
An ice-cold beer sittin' in the console

Memory lane up in the headlights  
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times  
I'm turning off of real life drivin' that's right  
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm shotgun seat  
That FM dial turned to 11  
My buddies and me were heros  
As long as we never turned it down

Voices buzzing cellphones lighting up the console  
That Miler Genuine Draft pouring down the console  
Ain't a law been broken yet  
Thank God Almighty beer never broke my heart

Like diamond rings and football teams  
Have torn this boy apart  
Like a neon dream it just dawned on me  
That bars and this guitar  
And long-necked ice-cold beer never broke my heart

She was a Carolina blue jean  
Baby fire in her eyes that drove me crazy  
It was red tail lights when she left town  
If I didn't know then I sure know now

That long stretch of headlights  
Bending 'round them corners  
Lately I can't help but think  
That's a long long way from my home

Voices buzzing cellphones lighting up the console  
That Miler Genuine Draft pouring down the console  
Ain't a law been broken yet  
Thank God Almighty beer never broke my heart

Like diamond rings and football teams  
Have torn this boy apart  
Like a neon dream it just dawned on me  
That bars and this guitar  
And long-necked ice-cold beer never broke my heart

It never broke my heart

Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh woah
Woah woah
Oh


I won't I won't I won't
Yeah I said I won't I won't yeah


Pockets full lil' drink I could bag up
Baltimore know they love me like I'm Kaepernick
Different colored chains think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And I'm just tryna show the kids they could do what they want
My partner's still sellin' dope I'm just here to rap it up
I'm bout to hit the club make me somethin' to back it up
Don't nobody want no beef with you you a coward
She said she wanna fuck but I ain't have the time
For my wrist or neck I spent a cool half a milly'
Got more slaps than the Beatles
Foreign shit runnin' like Weezy she mine like a feature
I'm a diamond that's pressure I'm addicted to cheese

Money in the way I can't see my lil' brother face
Lookin' like a safe got racks in the safe
They got a lil' cold so they're handin' me the J's
And I just hit the freeway got money no cheapstakes
Whip it like a DJ bringin' real life to your day

Some things you can't escape
I promise that they can't erase the scars with a Band-Aid
It was meant to be your mind and it's fate
So let's get it today

Yo sé que la canción 'tá cabrona hot hot
Pero pa' la' gata' cabrona' hehe
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah ey

I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves


Now they're right upon me waitin' for a sign
Or a movement from me
I'm I'm still I wanna be
A silhouette in the final scene
When you fall asleep


And you can see it with the lights out
Lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love


Morning as I wake
Shower and I shave
I'd be careful careful careful
Of fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin'
But here I am
Fallin' down with my feet on the ground
And my head in the clouds


Now they're right upon me waitin' for a sign
Or a movement from me
I'm I'm still I wanna be
A silhouette in the final scene
When you fall asleep


And you can see it with the lights out
Lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love


Shadows settle on the place that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
Destroy the middle it's a waste of time
From the perfect start to the finish line


And if you're still breathing you're the lucky ones
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting pictures from a flood that wrecked our home
It was a flood that wrecked this


Well I've been sleepin' in a stable mate
For all the foals of my dreams are chasin' you around in the garden
And if my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be your love
It's never gonna be your love
It's never gonna be your love

Yeah yeah yeah


Yeah leave me alone I'm just tryna find my way
Beggin' me to stay but leave me alone I'm just tryna find my way
Ayy leave me alone I'm just tryna find my way
Beggin' me to stay but leave me alone leave me alone ayy


I done seen too many get stuck up in they ways Facts

So leave me alone I'm just tryna find my way
Beggin' me to stay but leave me alone I'm just tryna find my way
Ayy leave me alone I'm just tryna find my way
Beggin' me to stay but leave me alone leave me alone ayy

But when I'm up now everybody wanna rob me Facts
Leave me alone please leave me alone just leave me alone oh yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah leave me alone
Some days things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate people tell me to medicate

Feelin' my blood runnin' swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this sh*t's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh I gotta keep keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh I gotta keep keep on breathin'

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out that's just how I cope ay
Can't keep on losing you
Over complications
Gone too soon

Hold on to the memories and keep them alive
Can't let this plane go down
Can't let this plane go down
And I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes

Yeah I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh oh I'm fallin' so I'm takin' my time on my ride
Oh I'm fallin' so I'm takin' my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
Verse 1:
Oh this the one right here Wicked
Okay
Yeah yeah

Run that back Turbo

Yeah

I know myself far too well to be a stranger of pain
Despite it all we remainin' the same
I'm just tryna better myself I ain't runnin' game
Just want you to know that your efforts aren't in vain

Used to be at Silver Crest always played my position
Couldn't make a better way had no choice I had to get it
Out the mud mud mud I'm still getting dirty
Nothin' ever came perfect had to gain a little purpose

Chorus:
We started off as close friends Close friends
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend My girlfriend
We used to tell each other everything Everything
I even went and bought her diamond rings matching earrings
Everything was so cool So cool couldn't nobody tell us shit no No
But like the sun you know I had to set Set it off
And like the leaves I had to fall but ain't nothin' wrong with that Nothin' wrong with that
Verse 2:
I done came round way girl I know you wan' be saved girl
I can see it in your face you don't have to hide no more
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mama's we'd argue almost every month
Nigga I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at I gave you the keys 'fore you left now you running late" and I'm like "I'm on the way"
Headlights illuminating the dark driveway
Backwoods smellin' like a ashtray
I'm just tryna make a way through the concrete jungle
Who knew that you would come and change the weather
Chorus:
We started off as close friends Close friends
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend My girlfriend
We used to tell each other everything Everything
I even went and bought her diamond rings matching earrings
Everything was so cool So cool couldn't nobody tell us shit no No
But like the sun you know I had to set Set it off
And like the leaves I had to fall but ain't nothin' wrong with that Nothin' wrong with that

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Rumor" by Lee Brice:

Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd little bar little town
Round this old dance floor my eyes just follow yours out
Anywhere you wanna go baby just let me know
I'm down for whatever yeah

So no matter how the story's told
I won't let you go
What they're tryna say is
Love's the one thing that we save
We can make it easy
OR make it tough
Said I'm all in no bluff

Do you believe in fate
Tell me do you believe in love
You're makin' me start to believe in something
That I never thought I'd be

And no matter how the story's told
Girl I refuse to let you go
Won't let you go
What they're tryna say is
Love's the one thing that we save
We can make it easy
OR make it tough
Said I'm all in no bluff
It's a rumor
Makin' rounds
Everybody knows what they're talkin' bout
You're a lover one more undercover
And you wanna be found
Wanna be found

Oh girl you wanna be found

And no matter how the story's told
I won't let you go
We're all about that real
From the way your lips feel
To the way you whisper my name
Do you believe in fate
Tell me do you believe in love

Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love to carry children of our own


We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand
Be my girl I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Well baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect no I don't deserve this


You look perfect tonight


We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand
Be my girl I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

I don't need a whole lot of money
I don't need a big fine car
I got everything that a man could want
I got more than I could ask for


I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I got me a sweet a sweet-loving woman
And she knows just how to treat me right


Well my baby she's all right
Well my baby she's clean out of sight
Don't you know that she's
She's some kind of wonderful
She's some kind of wonderful


I wanna tell you when I'm with her
I know that I'm never alone
She's alright and she's alright with me
You know she's just everything I need


I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I got me a sweet a sweet-loving woman
And she knows just how to treat me right


Well my baby she's all right
Well my baby she's clean out of sight
Don't you know that she's
She's some kind of wonderful
She's some kind of wonderful

The way that Gucci look on you amazing
But nothin' can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you're the one for me I need to face it

Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mom found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder


Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful beautiful life right now
Beautiful beautiful night right now

Verse 1:
We've been to both Carolina's
Seen a big Montana sky
Drank sweet tea in Mississippi
And watched the sun rise

Bridge:
We’ve laughed and cried and barely got by
But here we stand stronger than steel
Wherever we go whatever we do
Yeah we’re just getting started

Chorus:
Cause when you’re by my side
I’ve got nothing to hide
So when I’m feeling lost
Or feeling right at home
Baby we can take our time
And let the world turn Leave our worries behind
Yeah we’ll be just fine With our eyes on the sunset
Sipping on our wine

Verse 2:
We’ve driven out to the country
Danced out in the rain
Caught fish down at the river
And called each other names

Repeat Bridge and Chorus

Bridge:
We’ve laughed and cried and barely got by
But here we stand stronger than steel
Wherever we go whatever we do
Yeah we’re just getting started

Repeat Chorus

I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the doors and turn out the lights


Baby all I wanna do is get a little wild
And lose myself in your kiss just like this
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
I wanna be all over you like a cheap suit
In a room without a window to the outside world
We can do it all night we can play it like it's nine to five
It's all to myself 'til the morning light


I'm jealous of the rain that falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain I'm jealous of the wind
I'm jealous of the night I'm jealous of the dark


Baby all I wanna do is get a little wild
And lose myself in your kiss just like this
And when the morning light comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
I wanna be all over you like a cheap suit
In a room without a window to the outside world
We can do it all night we can play it like it's nine to five
It's all to myself 'til the morning light


I wanna be all over you like a cheap suit
In a room without a window to the outside world
We can do it all night we can play it like it's nine to five
It's all to myself 'til the morning light


It's all to myself 'til the morning light

I'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't about to have no boo
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten it's crazy
I can't have what I want but neither can you


You ain't my boyfriend
And I ain't your girlfriend
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend Boyfriend
And I ain't your girlfriend Girlfriend
But you don't want me to touch nobody else
Baby we ain't gotta tell nobody


Can't keep my hands to myself

But you don't want me to touch nobody else

There's something in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good


Trying to stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darling I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place


Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong going on outside


There's something in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good


Trying to stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darling I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place


Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong going on outside

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me  
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy  
I need somebody to heal  
Somebody to know  
Somebody to have  
Somebody to hold  
It's easy to say  
But it's never the same  
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain  

Now the day bleeds  
Into nightfall  
And you're not here  
To get me through it all  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved  

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to  
This all or nothing way of loving's got me sleeping without you  
I need somebody to know  
Somebody to heal  
Somebody to have  
Just to know how it feels  
It's easy to say but it's never the same  
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape  

Now the day bleeds  
Into nightfall  
And you're not here  
To get me through it all  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved  

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes  
I fall into your arms  
I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around  

For now the day bleeds  
Into nightfall  
And you're not here  
To get me through it all  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved  

But now the day bleeds  
Into nightfall  
And you're not here  
To get me through it all  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved  
I let my guard down  
And then you pulled the rug  
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
Right now Blanco Brown's "The Git Up" original version lists the following uncensored lyrics:


Right now


Gonna do the two-step then cowboy boogie
Grab a sweetheart and spin out with ‘em
Do the hoedown and get into it
C’mon y’all let’s groove

To the left to the left now
To the right to the right
Now take your left hand and put it on your side
Gonna roll it down put it on your hip
And let’s have a good time


C’mon

You gotta run for it run for it
Then you dive for the rope
Spread your wings and honk the horn
Now you’re country-fied hippie chic
Where you come from country or the city

I’m Missouri but we’re living in the sticks
Huh come on


Gonna do the two-step then cowboy boogie
Grab a sweetheart and spin out with ‘em
Do the hoedown and get into it
C’mon y’all let’s groove

To the left to the left now
To the right to the right
Now take your left hand and put it on your side
Gonna roll it down put it on your hip
And let’s have a good time


Cupid Shuffle to the right
And then to the left mm-hmm
She told me put my boots on I said "I don't know"
I'm tryna "Juju" on the beat now slide foot up right foot slide
Basically I'm saying either way we 'bout to slide ayy

C’mon

Gonna do the two-step then cowboy boogie
Grab a sweetheart and spin out with ‘em
Do the hoedown and get into it
C’mon y’all let’s groove

To the left to the left now
To the right to the right
Now take your left hand and put it on your side
Gonna roll it down put it on your hip
And let’s have a good time


ha ha ha


Gonna do the two-step then cowboy boogie
Grab a sweetheart and spin out with ‘em
Do the hoedown and get into it
C’mon y’all let’s groove

To the left to the left now
To the right to the right
Now take your left hand and put it on your side
Gonna roll it down put it on your hip
And let’s have a good time

Thems hairs peekin' out from the bottom of your shirt

I'd be happy to provide the uncensored lyrics of "Look What God Gave Her" by Thomas Rhett:

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said "Baby I just want to dance"

Chorus:
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes

I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

Repeat Chorus twice

When I woke up I was all alone
With a broken heart and a ticket home
And I ask you now tell me what would you do
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue

'Cause I've traveled around I've been all over the world
Boys I ain't never seen nothing like a Galway girl
And now she's got me singing like

Repeat Chorus Twice

And now we've outstayed our welcome and its closing time
I was holding her hand her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke whisky and wine
As the last one was falling I was already blind

Repeat Chorus Twice

Jesus at my feet but he won't keep me low
Got a lot of chips on me so I'm either stacking or I'm broke
I'm a real young king watch me sit on my throne
I ain't worried 'bout a mothaf***in' thing 'cause I'm grown
I tote the chrome in case I gotta send some shots at my clone
I'm a sniper sitting high money causing heli-drones
Catch a opp then it's chop him down and leave him long
Shoot him in his leg make sure he can't run
I hope anybody facing me they brought a gun
Lately I been having evil thoughts
Murder one scene somebody call Fox
I'm riding with my shooters we gon' shoot you in yo top
Riding with the 40 I'm gon' shoot you in yo knot
I'm riding with my n****'s and we coming out to flip the block
Young nigga ice game cold like a hockey rink
On the stand he gon' sing just like Aretha sing
Fuck the jury and the judge if they tryna give me life
Two 23's on me bullets flying through the night
45 on my side case a nigga wanna fight
I'm praying to my Glock my 40 be my wife
Bussin' at them opps bet them n****'s won't think twice
Big 45 on me and you know it got a knife
Uh-huh oh no oh
Ooh-ooh
Uh-huh oh no oh
Ooh-ooh

When I was young I fell in love
With you used to hold hands man that was enough
Then we grew up started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus

Oh no your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside

In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me singing

Oh no your daddy didn't like me much no
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside

She used to meet me on the Eastside
Oh-ooh
Ooh-ooh oh-ooh oh-ooh-ooh

City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere

Oh maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something Oh no
Me myself I got nothing to prove Oh

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money

Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

Oh no your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside

She used to meet me on the Eastside
Ooh-ooh oh-ooh oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh oh oh yeah

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Murder on My Mind" by YNW Melly:


Ayy I'm in the studio bro
Oh my God Lil' Scuddy you a genius


Boy you ain't never runnin' no smoke
Boy you ain't never you ain't never gon' do nothin'
Ayy wе gon' spin his block then we gon' rеload it

With my slime Lil' Keed yeah we poke his nose yeah
I'ma slap this grind now she gon' suck my toes okay

I ain't get to roll no weed ain't get to roll no swishers
I was locked up on Christmas ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitchin'
Everybody acting suspicious might prolly say that I'm trippin'
When I'm all alone in my mind I'm just stuck inside a prison
And all I think about is murder reconsiderate and killin'
These niggas be fakin' they bitches be stalkin' I'm movin' in silence
Yeah I know that they shawty they see me and get excited
Two hundred shots four hundred shots yeah we shooting shit up
Most of these niggas they can't even pay me enough
I'm a soldier a killer a gorilla change a nigga's life for fun
I'd kill any nigga for fucking with my money I'm on demon time
I might ride with my chopper thirty pop up bet I make him sign


Boy you ain't never runnin' no smoke
Boy you ain't never you ain't never gon' do nothin'
Ayy we gon' spin his block then we gon' reload it
Ayy I got too many racks too many hoes yeah
I'll blow that money they take my soul now
Miami or LA yeah they got my bros yeah
With my slime Lil' Keed yeah we poke his nose yeah
I'ma slap this grind now she gon' suck my toes okay
I just don't know


Oh my God Lil' Scuddyy you again
This a million dollar beat

Verse 1]
I've cheated and I've lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I've got nothing to hide
No more


I've loved and I've hurt
But it's worth all the learning
I've lived some and learned some
But I'm still learning


I'm sorry for the way that I've been
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done


I've been the devil I've been the saint
A little bit of both every single day
I'm proud of what I'm doing
And I'm proud of who I am


I've loved and I've hurt
But it's worth all the learning
I've lived some and learned some
But I'm still learning


I'm sorry for the way that I've been
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done


Ah ooh
Ah ooh
Ah ooh
Ah ooh

I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful baby uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there


But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like


Me-ee ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you baby
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
And there's a lot of lame guys out there


'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter I am your summer
Baby doll when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like


Me-ee ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


Hey kids spelling is fun

If you really hate don't murder me with these hands uh-huh-huh

Bling bling then I solve 'em that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down but you're holdin' me back
And that's the sound of me not callin' you back

Why men great 'til they gotta be great
Don't text me tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay

You tried to break my heart
Oh that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No you ain't from the start
Hey I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean who would wanna hide this
I will never ever ever ever ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend "shoot your shot" when you see 'em
It's OK he already in my DMs
Now come on come on say
Hey hey

I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night

Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine I'm fine

But when I taste tequila baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Swearing on a Bible baby I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car

Baby your memory it only hits me this hard

When I taste tequila baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Swearing on a Bible baby I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

I ain't even drunk I ain't even drunk and I'm thinking
How I need your love how I need your love yeah
It's nothing new that's what I'm supposed to do
When I taste tequila when I taste tequila

When I taste tequila baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Swearing on a Bible baby I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila when I taste tequila
Verse 1: Khalid
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe mmm

Are you down for the ride
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
My whole lifetime

Chorus: Khalid & Normani
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it you ain't with it

So baby tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

Verse 2: Normani
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history
Are you into me ayy
When it feels so good but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on baby let me get to know you
Just a little bit better I'mma hope it's comin' ayy

Chorus: Khalid & Normani
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it you ain't with it

Underneath the sunrise
