The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go mmmm

Drinking fast and then we talk slow mmmm
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now mmmm

Pre-Chorus:
Take my hand stop put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like

Chorus:
Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Say boy let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

Verse 2:
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too

And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Take my hand stop put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like

Hey yeah
Dididiri Daddy go

Sí sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy DY
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy Oh
Tú tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso Oh yeah
Ya ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito sube sube sube
Sube sube

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos favoritos baby
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido Diridiri dirididi Daddy
Si te pido un beso ven dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero quiero quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento después salvaje

Pasito a pasito suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito sube sube sube
Sube sube

I've been reading books of old  
The legends and the myths  
Achilles and his gold  
Hercules and his gifts  
Spider-Man's control  
And Batman with his fists  
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list  

She said "Where'd you wanna go  
How much you wanna risk  
I'm not looking for somebody  
With some superhuman gifts  
Some superhero  
Some fairytale bliss  
Just something I can turn to  
Somebody I can kiss"

I've been reading books of old  
The legends and the myths  
The testaments they told  
The moon and its eclipse  
And Superman unrolls  
A suit before he lifts  
But I'm not the kind of person  
That it fits  

She said "Where'd you wanna go  
How much you wanna risk  
I'm not looking for somebody  
With some superhuman gifts  
Some superhero  
Some fairytale bliss  
Just something I can turn to  
Somebody I can miss"

Verse 1: Andrew Taggart
Hey I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car and
Four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop no I I I can't stop

Verse 2: Halsey
So baby pull me closer in the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner of the mattress that we stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car and
Four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop no I I I can't stop

Bridge: Halsey
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson okay

Moved to the city in a broke-down car and
Four years no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and

No I I I can't stop
Got a girl from the southside got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'm sorry but I cannot provide any commentary or labels as per your request
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been oh ooh
The way that things have been oh ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail I'm the master of my sea oh ooh
The master of my sea oh ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taken my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me took to me shook to me feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the
Pain pain

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove oh ooh
Your spirit up above oh ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings they would drown
But they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
Inhibited limited
'Til it broke up and it rained down
It rained down like

Pain pain

You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwing up


Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said I already told you
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go


I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night


When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you get better
You make me feel this way somehow


I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most


I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Alright Here are the uncensored lyrics of "24K Magic" by Bruno Mars:


Tonight
I just want to take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right


Players put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls what y'all trying to do
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe soul player
Uh look out


Pop pop it's show time show time
Show time show time
Guess who's back again
Oh they don't know Go on tell 'em
Oh they don't know Go on tell 'em
I bet they know soon as we walk in showin' up
Wearing Cuban links ya
Designer minks ya
Inglewood's finest shoes whoop whoop
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Huh Known to give the color red the blues


Players put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls what y'all trying to do
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe soul player
Uh look out


Everywhere I go they be like
Ooh so player-istic
Got to be greener than to chase ya'
This is gear
Now player player player
Uh everywhere I go they be like
Ooh so player-istic
Got to be greener than to chase ya'
This is gear
Now player player player


Players put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Girls what y'all trying to do
What you trying to do
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe soul player
Uh look out
24 karat magic magic magic
All along it was a fever
A cold with high-headed believers
I threw my hands in the air and said "Show me something"
He said if you dare come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay stay
I want you to stay hooh
Ooh
The reason I hold on
Ooh cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the lights
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay stay
I want you to stay oh

Let's go
Verse 1: Swae Lee
Black Beatles in the city be back immediately 
to confiscate the moneys ear Drummers 
Rae Sremm Guwop Mike WiLL 
I sent flowers but you said you didn't receive em 
But you said you didn't need them 

Chorus: Swae Lee 
That girl is a real crowd pleaser 
Small world all her friends know of me 
Young bull living like an old geezer 
Release the cash watch it fall slowly 
Frat girls still tryna get even 
Haters mad for whatever reason 
Smoke in the air binge drinking 
They losing when the DJ drops the needle 

Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi
Getting so cold I'm not blinking 
What in the world was I thinking 
New day new money to be made 
There is nothing to explain 
I'm a fucking black Beatle cream seats in the Regal 
Rocking John Lennon lenses like to see 'em spread eagle 
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table 
Screaming "everybody's famous" like clockwork I blow it all 
Then get some more 
Get you somebody that can do both 
Black Beatles got the babes belly rolling 
She think she love me I think she trolling 

Chorus: Swae Lee 
That girl is a real crowd pleaser 
Small world all her friends know of me 
Young bull living like an old geezer 
Release the cash watch it fall slowly 
Frat girls still tryna get even 
Haters mad for whatever reason 
Smoke in the air binge drinking 
They losing when the DJ drops the needle 

Verse 3: Gucci Mane
Came in with two girls look like strippers in their real clothes 
A broke hoe can only point me to a rich hoe 
A yellow bitch with green hair a real weirdo 
Black man yellow Lamb' real life goals 
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door 
There's so much money on the floor we're losing count of it 
whoo 
All eyes on me I'm on Marion Jones 
Bridges burned all across the board 
Destroyed but what for 
what for 
If you can't answer that then I can't fuck with you anymore 
ah 
Done with me Then you done snorted 
Cudi peak oh felt like Sabonis 
Pause well in Salem I'm a god 
hey hey 
That oregano make it fat 
hey hey hey 

Chorus: Swae Lee 
That girl is a real crowd pleaser 
Small world all her friends know of me 
Young bull living like an old geezer 
Release the cash watch it fall slowly 
Frat girls still tryna get even 
Haters mad for whatever reason 
Smoke in the air binge drinking 
They losing when the DJ drops the needle 

Outro: Swae Lee 
She's a good teaser and we blowing reefer 
Your body like a work of art baby 
Don't fuck with me I'll break your heart baby 
D&G on me I got a lot of flavor 
15 hundred on my feet I'm trying to kill these haters 
I had haters when I was broke I'm rich I still got haters 
I had hoes when I was broke I'm rich I'm still a player 
I wear leather Gucci jackets like its still the 80's 
I've been blowing OG Kush I feel a lil' sedated

I'm tryna put you in the worst mood ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes ah
Milli point two just to hurt you ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you ah
None of these toys on lease too ah
Made your whole year in a week too yah
Main bitch out your league too ah
Side bitch out of your league too ah


House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me I don't see the shade
Switch up my style I take any lane
I switch up my cup I kill any pain


Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done

Every day a nigga try to test me ah
Every day a nigga try to end me ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV ah
Pockets overweight gettin' hefty ah
Coming for the king that's a far cry I
I come alive in the fall time I
The competition I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me I don't see the shade
Switch up my style I take any lane

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall
Took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love we just pray for cars
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing yeah

Oh I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

I feel so free when you're with me
Baby baby there's nothing holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing yeah

Oh I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back oh

I feel so free
When you're with me baby
Baby there's nothing holdin' me back
Said little bitch you can't fuck with me

Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls hoping you'll call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all
Baby baby I feel crazy up all night all night and every day
Give me something oh but you say nothing
What is happening to me


I don't wanna live forever 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever ooh I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home


I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life hmm
Baby baby I feel crazy up all night all night and every day
I gave you something but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me


I don't wanna live forever 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit fit babe wherever wherever I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home


I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby baby I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something oh but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab I tell 'em where your place is


What is happening to me
And I don't wanna fit wherever I don't wanna live forever 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor the bowery
Nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough


No I don't wanna know where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
It ain't me no no
It ain't me no no
It ain't me no no
It ain't me no no


I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and the liberties
Never growing up
I'll take with me the polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us


Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
It ain't me no no
It ain't me no no
It ain't me no no
It ain't me no no


It ain't me it ain't me
It ain't me it ain't me
It ain't me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
It ain't me
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep
It ain't me
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone
It ain't me
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning
It ain't me


It ain't me no no
It ain't me no no
It ain't me no no

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed she knows no limits
She craves attention she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor


Oh she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made


But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful


She has dreams to be an envy so she's starving
You know "Covergirls eat nothing"
She says "Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"What's a little bit of hunger" "I could go a little while longer"
She fades away she don't see her perfect
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface


Oh oh


So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful


No better you than the you that you are no better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living no better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine you're a star no better time for your shine you're a star
Oh you're beautiful oh you're beautiful


And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful we're stars and we're beautiful
And you got me like oh
What you want from me
What you want from me
And I tried to buy your pretty heart
But the price too high
Baby you got me like oh mm
You love when I fall apart fall apart
So you can put me together
And throw me against the wall baby
You got me like ah woo ah
Don't you stop loving me loving me
Don't quit loving me loving me

And I can't get enough

Just take it step-by-step

'Cause they never tell me lies

And the heat between your legs

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run I know what you've been through

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then take me back to when


I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night I don't reckon I did it right
But I was younger then take me back to when


We found weekend jobs when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home and I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

Am I out of my head
Am I out of my mind
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good that you can't explain it
What can I say it's complicated


Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tat
Eyes closed while you scream out


And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
Like I want you to take me forever

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought "How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else"
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cutting class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Ooh la la ooh la la
Ooh la la ooh la la
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents

Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric wavey when I turn it on
All through my city all through my home
We're flying up no ceiling when we're in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it moving so phenomenally

Room on lock the way we rock it so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move well you already know

So just imagine just imagine just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance dance dance
Feeling good good creeping up on you
So just dance dance dance come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance dance dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon so keep dancing

I got that feeling I got that feeling
Inside my bones inside my bones inside my bones
I'm into that feeling I'm into that feeling
Inside my bones inside my bones inside my bones

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance dance dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance dance dance come on
Ooh it's something magical
It's in the air it's in my blood it's rushing on
Don't need no reason don't need control
I fly so high no ceiling when I'm in my zone

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes sir" not a follower
Fit the box fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer take a number
I was lightning before the thunder


Thunder thunder
Thunder thun' thunder
Thun-thun-thunder thunder
Thunder thunder
Thunder thun' thunder
Thun-thun-thunder thunder


Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
You say you're basic you say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds


Thunder thunder
Thunder thun' thunder
Thun-thun-thunder thunder
Thunder thunder
Thunder thun' thunder
Thun-thun-thunder thunder


Thunder feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder

Dude your girlfriend is a groupie she just tryna get in
Sayin' "I'm with the band"
Verse 1:
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't

I just couldn't

Pre-Chorus:
Baby I know that you've been wondering
Mmm so here goes nothing

Chorus:
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

Verse 2:
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it mmm
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking

I'm thinking

Pre-Chorus:
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm it's time you hear 'em

Chorus:
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

Bridge:
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

Chorus:
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
Oh in case you didn't know
All my friends are heathens take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people
Docked away
Just another psycho killer
Faceless unremarkable

You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens take it slow
Watch it
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Watch it
All my friends are heathens take it slow
Watch it
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Please don't make any sudden moves
Watch it
You don't know the half of the abuse
Watch it
All my friends are heathens take it slow
Watch it
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Watch it

I don't wanna fight right now
Know you always right now
Know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one that could finally change me
I'm not quite alright and I'll tell you for the last time

You know you're all my life
You know you're all my life

And I need you to know that we're
Fallin' so fast we're fallin' like the stars fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words with you I'm safe
We're fallin' so fast we're fallin' like the stars fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words with you I'm safe

I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me Gabe
And I'm glad that you finally reached out
Me and the rest of the guys we're all doing pretty good
I'll admit things got a little bit crazy for a minute there
But you know all in all I'm doing okay
Just been busy working on my stuff you know
But enough about me how's everything going
How's the family and stuff

I'm not quite sure what we're still doing
I just want us to be normal again
But then you'll go and make me feel so—

We're fallin' so fast we're fallin' like the stars fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words with you I'm safe oh-ooh-ooh falling in love
We're fallin' so fast we're fallin' like the stars fallin' in love
And I'm not scared to say those words with you I'm safe oh-ooh-ooh falling in love
Bitch named Caroline whoa
She's the reason for the word "bitch" bitch
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Trying to hurry up to get to some
Baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror
And crash crash crash into a ditch ooh
Just playing she needs a better role model
Her stupid-ass friends ain't ever got her back
I wonder why she insist on trying
To act like a grown-up when she just a baby
And I ain't never seen her drive the city
In a '63 but I bet I'll see her out in the club
I bet I'll see her out in the club with a broken heel
Uh she acting like a hoe now woo
She forgot her morals and her values woo
I remember being broke and down bad
But I ain't ever let a nigga drive me to the point where
I'm a have to steal and I ain't ever had a job no
Took the underground to the top ho
Booked a bedroom and bathroom just to get a shot oh God
Oops oh man I think I'm in love
Oh man I think I'm in love whoa

Cocaine quarter piece got war and peace inside my DNA

Everythin' I say been unheard just in case you play play play
For keeps don't play us for weak

Goddamn goddamn conversations with legends
Crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin' hit the ratchet tell the reverend
I'm so elated I'm never worried I'm yellin'
"Bitch you better have my money"—through rain sleet and hail uh
Kush in my lungs ink on my fingers
I'm losin' my patience I'm losin' my mind
This is the consequences when you rollin' with my kind
I'm livin' life on a la-la-line
I'm hopin' to find my nirvana taking my time
Rewritin' my rhyme vision impaired blind
I'm losin' my mind case closed—crack smoke I'm back home
Baby momma in my ear now I'm on the throne
Listen close you hear that Don't take it to heart
'Cause I'm the N-I-G-G-A E-double-M-Y the K-I-N-G G-Scott of the city of C-O-M-P-T-O-N
So fuck everybody livin' in competition
Two times platinum forget your existence
I erased myself with a razor blade
Erased myself like I cut away


I got I got I got I got
Loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA

Passin' up on my old ways

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways

And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby I go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

Everything keeps slipping
Trying to find a way to quit
But I just can't admit
Nothing I can do about it
Ain't no supplement for you
It's like a runaway train
Trying to find the way to stop

I used to be a heartache
Talking to the barkeep
Trying to drink the thought of you
Off of me


You're the line that I can't quite hit
Everything keeps slipping
Trying to find a way to quit
But I just can't admit
Nothing I can do about it
Ain't no supplement for you
It's like a runaway train
Trying to find the way to stop


And that's the thing about ya
That's so hard to swallow
That's why I still run straight back to you


You're the line that I can't quite hit
Everything keeps slipping
Trying to find a way to quit
But I just can't admit
Nothing I can do about it
Ain't no supplement for you
It's like a runaway train
Trying to find the way to stop


Trying to find the way to stop
Trying to find the way to stop
Verse 1:
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

Chorus:
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

Verse 2:
But every time you hurt me the less that I cry
And every time you leave me the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out the less I love you
Baby we don't stand a chance it's sad but it's true

Chorus:
I'm way too good at goodbyes goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes goodbyes
No way that you'll see me cry see me cry
I'm way too good at goodbyes goodbyes

Bridge:
No no no no no I'm way too good at goodbyes
No no no no no I'm way too good at goodbyes

Chorus:
I'm way too good at goodbyes goodbyes
I'm way too good at goodbyes goodbyes
No way that you'll see me cry see me cry
I'm way too good at goodbyes goodbyes
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Young Dumb & Broke" by Khalid:


So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I cannot give you everything you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give


While we're young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids


Y'all don't know what it's like
Being male middle class and white
It's a bitch if you don't believe
Listen up to my new CD
Shades of blue skies and golden leaves
My girl the other day told me "I didn't know you were half Lebanese"
It's kind of weird I never knew that
Either way white guys in LA yeah


While we're young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids


Jump jump jump jump
Jump jump jump jump
Jump jump jump jump
Cause all the time we're way too young and stupid to try


While we're young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb young young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids

Mmm-mmm
Let's go
Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes

You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

We never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets The bullets

We never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets The bullets

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here

We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying
It'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying
Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets The bullets

We never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets The bullets

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying
Baby it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

We never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets The bullets

We never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets The bullets

We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn
We've been here before
It's just what we know

Don't take your chances
Don't take your chances

I just wanted to let you know
That sometimes I think about you
And I and I feel real low
And I and I feel real low
If you're not loving me
The way I want you to
I'll move on sure enough
I'll just find somebody new

Don't you know the kind of man I am
The kind to do what I can
And then some for you

Some people'll do anything for love
Some people'll do anything for fame
Some people refuse to hold on for love
Some people refuse to let go for the same

One too many times
I fell over you
Once in a lifetime
Just won't do

Some people'll do anything for love
Some people'll do anything for fame
Some people refuse to hold on for love
Some people refuse to let go for the same

Some people'll do anything for love
Some people'll do anything for fame
Some people'll do anything for love
Some people'll do anything for fame
Verse 1:
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind

Pre-Chorus:
I always thought I would sink so I never swam
I never went boatin' don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

Chorus:
But here I am next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

Verse 2:
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current as I just smiled
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change

Pre-Chorus:
And it'll be us just for a while
Doin' nothin' in my little place down on the Malibu shore

Chorus:
But here I am next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

Bridge:
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you

Chorus:
But here I am next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

Outro:
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu

Verse 1:
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

Pre-Chorus:
I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead

Chorus:
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby just to wake up with you

Verse 2:
Tell me what you want to do
Better yet what you want to be
I'll lay it out for you
If you don't like the way he's treating you
I'll gladly take your place
How can you be sure
You won't get the same reaction
Out of every guy you meet

Pre-Chorus:
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead

Chorus:
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby just to wake up with you

Bridge:
Even if you start to think
That we're moving too fast
Love lasts when everything else has passed
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever

Chorus:
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby just to wake up with you

Outro:
Can we talk about us
Can we talk about trust
Can we talk about love

Listen to the free audio song at your own risk as there might be explicit language: 

Verse 1:
Born and raised in a small town
Appalachian hills
He's got a tendency to walk through life
With his hands in his pockets
Fidgeting and tilting his head
To the left to the right
He's got a sass in his walk
Ain't afraid to just spit
It out

Pre-Chorus:
Brought up in a small town
No mother or father around
He's got his heart on his sleeve
But don't you mess with me

Chorus:
He's a small town boy
With a big town attitude
Hanging at the Wal-Mart parking lot
Drinking his Mountain Dew
He's in the groove
Got nothin' to prove
He's a rebel child
Tough to handle
Just like his buck knife

Verse 2:
He never backs down
Speaks his mind
He's a little bit brash a little bit wild
Just like his mama was
And his daddy too
Some folks say he ain't got a clue
But he's way smarter than he let's on
Got a wry sense of humor
And a heart as pure as the snow

Pre-Chorus:
Brought up in a small town
No mother or father around
He's got his heart on his sleeve
But don't you mess with me

Chorus:
He's a small town boy
With a big town attitude
Hanging at the Wal-Mart parking lot
Drinking his Mountain Dew
He's in the groove
Got nothin' to prove
He's a rebel child
Tough to handle
Just like his buck knife

Bridge:
He ain't no city slicker
He ain't no cowboy neither
The good folks in the county
Still don't know what to make of him
But to him it don't matter
He's got a heart as big as the sun
And he'll take on the world
If it means havin' a little fun

Chorus:
He's a small town boy
With a big town attitude
Hanging at the Wal-Mart parking lot
Drinking his Mountain Dew
He's in the groove
Got nothin' to prove
He's a rebel child
Tough to handle
Just like his buck knife

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Well you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh but after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become


'Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is "I wish you farewell"


I hope you're somewhere prayin' prayin'
I hope your soul is changin' changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees prayin'


I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters I can breathe again
And you said that I was done

'Cause I can make it on my own
And I don't need you
I found a strength I've never known
I'll bring thunder I'll bring rain oh hey


When I'm finished they won't even know your name

I hope you're somewhere prayin' prayin'

I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees prayin'

Someday maybe you'll see the light
Oh some say in life you're gonna get what you give
But some things only God can forgive


I hope you're somewhere prayin' prayin'
I hope your soul is changin' changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees prayin'

Made you scared of love too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
'Cause your precious heart
Is a precious heart


He didn't know what he had and I thank God oh oh oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you


What if I fall I won't let you fall
What if I cry I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter


I've been searching for you baby
For a long time mmm

And I prayed that you'd guide me to love
To keep it all together


And we're still here and we're holdin' on holdin' on

We're still going strong

You're still the one
You're still the one I run to I run to
The one that I belong to
You're the one I want for life
You're still the one
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of you're still the one I kiss goodnight


Ain't nobody gonna love you like I

I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it put you in a trance
Yeah yeah yeah


All I ever wanted was a Rolly Rolly
All I ever wanted was a Rolly Rolly
Cooling with the homies chilling with the homies
Now I got a Rolly I don't want no Rollie
I already got a thick bitch no need for a bony
Got a pocket full of guap and I'm living like Tony
Need a thick bitch lemme know though
Where the thick filles at let me know though

I just wanna Rolly Rolly Rolly with a dab of ranch

Flooded out my wrist now I feel like Kobe
I don't want the Rollie I want the Patek
I don't want the Rollie I want the Patek
I don't want the Rollie I want the Patek
I don't want the Rollie I want the Patek
I just want a plain Patek
All this water on my neck look like I fell when I'm jet skiing
I'm a smart guy I be learning from the lectures
Big bag on me I don't need no Tesla

I just wanna Rolly Rolly Rolly with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it put you in a trance
Yeah yeah yeah

Soy el fuego que arde tu piel
Soy el agua que mata tu sed
El castillo la torre yo soy
La espada que guarda el caudal

Tú el aire que respiro yo
Y la luz de la luna en el mar
La garganta que ansío mojar
Que temo ahogar de amor

Y qué dirías si hoy
De repente te aparezco
En la puerta de tu casa
Y te regalo una rosa

Y me lo agradeces pero
No te puedo hablar de amor
Porque otro ocupa tu lugar
Y por eso un beso yo no te puedo dar

- Beyoncé -
Como mueve ese culo ese culo
El día esta para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo lo miré y me gustó
Me pegué y lo invité
Bailemos eh

La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo lo miré y me gustó
Me pegué y lo invité
Bailemos eh

La mano arriba cintura sola
Da media vuelta y sacude duro
No sigas bajando
Mami deja el estrés sigue bailando
Su cabello suéltalo
Vamos a pegarnos como animales
Si no tienes una prisa
Yo me quiero dar la travesura contigo

Qué bien te queda a ti esa faldita
A ti que te vieron sola
Por qué no vienes aquí
Tú eres la única a la que quiero oír

- Beyoncé -
Como mueve ese culo ese culo
El día esta para un reggaetón lento

De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo lo miré y me gustó

Deja el pasado y déjame ser
El que te enamora y te protege
Soy maluma baby
Deja el pasado y déjame ser
El que te enamora y te protege
Soy maluma baby

Tú tienes la magia yo le sumo a mi lista
Baby no hay más na'
Solamente ven conmigo mujer
Ven conmigo eh

La mano arriba cintura sola
Da media vuelta y sacude duro
No sigas bajando
Mami deja el estrés sigue bailando
Su cabello suéltalo
Vamos pegarnos como animales
Si no tienes una prisa
Yo me quiero dar la travesura contigo

Tu cuerpo es la droga que a mi me llevo a la perdición
Por eso tú me buscas porque yo soy el dueño
Tu mujer sabe que yo soy tu verdadero amor
Por eso tú me tienes en un iPhone X
Yo sé que tú quieres lo mismo que yo
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero quiero quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa yo me quiero dar el viaje

Empecemos lento después salvaje
Pasito a pasito suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool no I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool no I don't like you oh


But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice oh


Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me ooh


I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast what
The world moves on another day another drama drama
But not for me not for me all I think about is karma


And then the world moves on but one thing's for sure
Hmm hmm
Maybe I got mine but you'll all get yours


Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me ooh


I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
