Verse 1:
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air like I don't care baby by the way

Chorus:
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Verse 2:
Here come bad news talking this and that
Yeah give me all you got don't hold back
Yeah no offense to you don't waste your time
Here's why

Chorus:

Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Bridge:
Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down I said

Chorus:
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth

Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Oh no
Did I get too close
Oh
Did I almost see what's really on the inside
All your insecurities all the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time


Unconditional unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally


Come on baby let me see
What you're hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock
Don't be a chicken boy stop acting like a bee-yotch
I'mma give you a taste of what it's like to be with me
I'mma make your wish come true
Wanna make you beg for more


She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer woo
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty's heart is on steroids
'Cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer
She can be a devil but she's a queen
At bed she's wilder than a lion
If you wanna see the girl next door
Yo go ahead and try to ask her out
But sorry homie girl's a straight-up bitch


Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Unconditional unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
hey There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally


So you wanna play with magic
Boy you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for ready for
A perfect storm perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine once you're mine
There's no going back
What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning no kidding I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy don't know what hit me but I'll be alright

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you oh oh

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall you're my muse
My worst distraction my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing it's ringing in my head for you

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you oh oh

Give me all of you
Cards on the table we're both showing hearts
Risking it all though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you oh oh
Verse 1: Iggy Azalea
First things first I'm the realest realest
Drop this and let the whole world feel it let 'em feel it
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down like I'm givin' lessons in physics right right

You should want a bad bitch like this huh
Drop it low and pick it up just like this yeah
Cup of Ace cup of Goose cup of Cris
High heels somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist on my wrist

Takin' all the liquor straight never chase that never
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back what
Bring the hooks in where the bass at
Champagne spillin' you should taste that

Chorus: Charli XCX
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From LA to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold
Remember my name 'bout to blow

Verse 2: Iggy Azalea
I said "Baby I do this I thought that you knew this"
Can't stand no haters and honest the truth is
And my flow retarded they speak it depart it
Swagger on stupid I can't shop at no department

To get my money on time if they not money decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time if they not money decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters gotta stay on my grind

Now tell me who that who that Uh-huh
That do that do that Uh-huh
I be the I-G-G-Y put my name in bold ahh

I been working I'm up in here with some change to throw
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From LA to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold
Remember my name 'bout to blow
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I could lie could lie could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be we'll be counting stars

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money watch it burn

Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie could lie could lie
Everything that downs me makes me wanna fly

Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be we'll be counting stars

I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby I've been I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars
Said no more counting dollars we'll be counting stars

Yes here are the uncensored lyrics of "Stay with Me" by Sam Smith:


Guess it's true I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave will you hold my hand


Oh won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling stay with me


Why am I so emotional
No it's not a good look gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt


Oh won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling stay with me


Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh oh oh ooh

Oh won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling stay with me

It's going down I'm yelling timber
You better move you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget


The bigger they are the harder they fall
This big-iddy boys are dig-ginn' it out
The floor is crowded that's what we see
But tonight we're on a mission to party

I'm watchin' her she's watchin' me
We're all alone in a crowd dancin' away
I'm tryin' to take her home I'm all alone
But she's got me stopped in my tracks


It's going down I'm yelling timber
You better move you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget


Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Nah it's just me ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels swing on planes
Blessed to say money ain't a thing

Linear youth that means I'm living life
Now let's enjoy this toast champagne nights
'Cause I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan
Put it on my lap baby "we'll go all night"


It's going down I'm yelling timber
You better move you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget


We'll be swinging oh we'll be swinging
Dancing bodies are swaying
Don't you baby don't you baby
Don't you baby baby us


It's going down I'm yelling timber
You better move you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget

Eh eh-o eh-o
Eh-o eh-o


I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show
And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above


But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before


How am I gonna be an optimist about this
How am I gonna be an optimist about this


But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before


Oh where do we begin
The rubble or our sins
Oh oh oh oh oh
Where do we begin
The rubble or our sins
And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above


But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
Nothing changed at all
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before
Verse 1:
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say mmm-mmm
That's what people say mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say mmm-mmm
That's what people say mmm-mmm

Chorus:
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music

Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off

Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way
I ain't tryna do what everybody else doing
Just cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know I'll fall but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine this road that I call home

So am I wrong
For thinking that we could be something for real
Now am I wrong
For trying to reach the things that I can't see

But that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

Am I tripping for having a vision
My prediction: I'ma be on the top of the world
Walk your walk and don't look back always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life that's just how I feel
Fight for yours and don't let go don't let them compare you no
Don't worry you're not alone that's just how we feel

So am I wrong
For thinking that we could be something for real
Now am I wrong
For trying to reach the things that I can't see

But that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la na na na
La la na na na la la
La la la la la la na na na

Am I wrong
For thinking that we could be something for real
Now am I wrong
For trying to reach the things that I can't see

But that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

Say something I'm giving up on you  
I'll be the one if you want me to  
Anywhere I would've followed you  
Say something I'm giving up on you  

And I am feeling so small  
It was over my head  
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall  
I'm still learning to love  
Just starting to crawl  

Say something I'm giving up on you  
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you  
Anywhere I would've followed you  
Say something I'm giving up on you  

And I will swallow my pride  
You're the one that I love  
And I'm saying goodbye  

Say something I'm giving up on you  
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you  
And anywhere I would've followed you  
Oh oh oh oh say something I'm giving up on you  
Say something I'm giving up on you  
Say something
Verse 1:
Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon your greatness and she'll send the call out
Mmmm mmmm

Verse 2:
Call all the ladies out they're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in their skin in craters like the moon
Mmmm mmmm

Chorus:
The moon we're at the top of the world
We're at the top of the world
We're at the top of the world

Bridge:
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air so there
I'm kinda older than I was when I reveled without a care so there
Damn son where'd you find this

Chorus:
The moon we're at the top of the world
We're at the top of the world
We're at the top of the world

Outro:
The world turned a flaw in the song
But you're not what you thought
Uh oh running to the start again
Uh oh running to the start again
Uh oh running to the start again
Uh oh running to the start again
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
The dreams come slow and go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
And you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

That's the uncensored lyrics of "Let Her Go" by Passenger
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town no postcode envy

But every song's like
Gold teeth Grey Goose trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains ball gowns trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody's like
Cristal Maybach diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes islands tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals Royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler ruler
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this we didn't come from money

But every song's like
Gold teeth Grey Goose trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains ball gowns trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody's like
Cristal Maybach diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes islands tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals Royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler ruler
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in heaven knows I tried


Don't let them in don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal don't feel don't let them know
Well now they know

Let it go let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway


It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right no wrong no rules for me
I'm free


Let it go let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on


My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back the past is in the past


Let it go let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

When the curtain's call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don't wanna let you down
But I am hellbound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days


She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone


And I'll be gone gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between


The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen the story the story
The story of the story of the


If I'm louder would you see me
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me
'Cause we are the same
You save me and when you leave it's gone again


The story of my life I give her hope give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside until she's broke inside
The story of my life the story of the story of
And I been waiting for this time to come around


But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life the story of the story of
Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything when will I learn
I push it down push it down

I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love feel the love

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same 
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray 
We went from nothing to something to something in a matter of seconds 
Love is only an obstacle crushes are nothing 
I know your feeling me I'm feeling you 
The fuckin' chemistry is crazy 
A attraction that a maggot would be proud of 
Baby you're a challenge let's explore your talent

And I'll be goin' harder than a Russian claimin' yard

Like a black widow baby 

 
This is not a love song 
This is a story about a girl who met a boy 
She thought he was the one but she didn't know she was poisoned 
He was bad she was down 
She was lost he was found 
Now she's caught in his web and he slowly spun her around 

 
Hey boy even when I'm feeling like I'm used up 
Baby I'll be on my blade sharp 
And I'll be goin' harder than a Russian claimin' yard

What's really crazy 
You should've known better 
Than to mess with me honey

Gonna love ya gonna love ya

Verse 1:
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations

Chorus:
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away

Verse 2:
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees

Chorus:
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

Bridge:
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following following following

Chorus:
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause all these strangers come over me
Now I can't get over you

No I just can't get over you
I'm just a map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Mapping mapping mapping
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Oh oh oh
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah never gonna give it up
No just don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh wo-o-o-o-o-oh

But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah never gonna give it up
No just don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control control

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

This is gonna be this is gonna be this is gonna be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up everybody up now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

Verse 1

As the leaves turned brown

Outro
When I met you in the summer

Sunbathing on the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate

Under your influence
You take me over you're the magic in my veins

Boom clap
You make me feel good

Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
Going under cast a spell just say the word

I feel your love

Boom clap
The sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and

Boom clap
You make me feel good

We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat

With every step we take Kyoto to the bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me
When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be

No no no no place I'd rather be
3x

We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you sacred simplicity
As long as we're together there's no place I'd rather be

With every step we take Kyoto to the bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me
When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be

No no no no place I'd rather be
3x

See like every minute that I'm with you I feel like I'm in paradise
Ah
If I could be anywhere tonight I would choose to be here by your side
Ah
Oh oh oh
No place I'd rather be ah
4x

Verse 1:
We clawed we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped never asking why
We kissed I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Pre-Chorus:
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie running for my life
I will always want you

Chorus:
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you you wreck me

Verse 2:
I put you high up in the sky
And now you're not coming down
It slowly turned you let me burn
And now we're ashes on the ground

Pre-Chorus:
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie running for my life
I will always want you

Chorus:
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you you wreck me

Bridge:
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you win

Chorus:
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you you wreck me
Said all I want from you  
Is to see you tomorrow  
And every tomorrow maybe you'll let me borrow  
Your heart and is it too much to ask for every Sunday  
And while we're at it throw in every other day to start  

I know people make promises all the time  
Then they turn right around and break them  
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife now you're bleeding  
But I could be that guy to heal it over time  
And I won't stop until you believe it  
'Cause baby you're worth it  

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me  
'Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me  

Spent all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free  
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me me  
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me me  

Now how about I'd be the last voice you hear tonight  
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are  
Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me  
'Cause I know that's a good place to start  

I know people make promises all the time  
Then they turn right around and break them  
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife now you're bleeding  
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time  
And I won't stop until you believe it  
'Cause baby you're worth it  

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me  
'Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me  
Spent all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free  
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me me  
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me me  

Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me  
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me  
No I won't fill your mind  
With broken promises and wasted time  
And if you fall you'll always land right in these arms  
These arms of mine  

Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me  
'Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true with me  
Spent all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free  
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me me  
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me me  

Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me  
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me  
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me with me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing so I fell for everything


You held me down but I got up hey
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground


You held me down but I got up hey
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar


Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero to my own hero


You held me down but I got up hey
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground


You held me down but I got up hey
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar


Roar roar roar roar roar
I got the eye of the tiger a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Some of you are fools
You criticize and judge without a clue
Don't you think it's time to stop
Talking down on people who don't wanna do what you say they should
Some of you are bad at communicating
But at least you try to make an effort
I said some of you are bad at communicating
But baby I'm yellin' at you
Ain't it fun ain't it fun
Baby now you're one of us
Ain't it fun ain't it fun
La la la la la ow
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Oh you're on your own in the real world
Oh you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Oh you're on your own in the real world
Oh you're on your own in the real world
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
I said some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Ain't it fun ain't it fun
Baby now you're one of us
Ain't it fun ain't it fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
Ain't it fun ain't it fun
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone
Where you're from you might be the one who's running things
Where you're from you might be the one who's running things
Though I didn’t understand then
That I could just speak up and
Make it hit harder than I did
I need a little time out
I need a little time out
I need a little time out
From me
La la la la la ow
Ain't it fun ain't it fun
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
Ain't it good being all alone
Don't go crying to your mama
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
Ain't it good being all alone

Go ahead and tell everybody I'm the man I'm the man I'm the man
Yes I am yes I am yes I am

Verse 2:
I believe every lie that I ever told
Paid for every heart that I ever stole

God made my mold different from the rest
Then he broke that mold so I know I'm blessed this is my world

Chorus:
Stand up now and face the sun

Bridge:

I'll be the quick relief to all your stressin'

Chorus:
It's time to do what must be done
Be a king when kingdom come
Well you can tell everybody yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody I'm the man I'm the man I'm the man
I'm the man I'm the man I'm the man
Yes I am yes I am yes I am

The mixtape's got a little Hank little Drake
A little something bumping thump thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll


We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud cuttin' through the countryside
Baby this is how we roll


Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream about one day
This is how we roll


This is how we do
We burnin' down the night
Shootin' bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll


We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
Let's roll
Hey Where's the drummer
Ha ha there you go yeah
Okay woo

Hey hey uh
Girl you're shining
Like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Ooh pretty baby
This world might have gone crazy
The way you save me who can blame me
When I just wanna make you smile

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye

You're over my head

Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind everything is so throwback-ish

Old-school chic like a movie star
From the silver screen
You're one of a kind living in a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic


Baby you're so classic


Four dozen of roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doing it Sinatra style
I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman bringin' glamor back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye
Like Hathaway write a song for you like this
You're over my head

I'll try my best to provide the uncensored lyrics of "Don't" by Ed Sheeran without any labels additional commentary censorship or information:

I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing "don't fօck with my love"
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that baby I don't wanna know that
Love has a limit when she mean it she crossed it
She's singing "don't fօck with my love"
I told her "she knows take aim and reload"
I don't wanna know that baby I don't wanna know that


I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion
Endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion
Endlessly


Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home


I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion
Endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion
Endlessly


You're the girl you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something baby
I think there's something baby

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

And I don't want to know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Oh-oh-oh

Sing
Louder
Sing
Louder
Sing
Louder
I will sing
Louder
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I will sing

You're waiting for something
But the middleman called
Spoke up
Said he ain't got nothing at all
So don't you get worried
‘Cause nothing's gonna be all right
Well the fumes and the chemicals
And the light bulbs are making me insane
We're on the edge
Of something wonderful
Aren't we

And I don't want to run
Rushed off my feet
And I don't want to know
If you're thinking of me
‘Cause it's nothing to me
And it's nothing to you
But not to me
Not to me
Oh-oh-oh

Sing
Louder
Sing
Louder
Sing
Louder
I will sing
Louder
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I will sing
Hey brother there's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey brother do you still believe in one another
Hey sister do you still believe in love I wonder
Oh if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home
Oh brother I will hear you call
What if I lose it all
Oh sister I will help you out
Oh if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey brother there's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister do you still believe in love I wonder
Oh if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home
Oh brother I will hear you call
What if I lose it all
Oh sister I will help you out
Oh if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you ooh oh
Yeah the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go
And the trumpets they go


Uh
Should've known you were gonna bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
Never gonna let you take me back


Oh oh oh
Heart ache
Almost lovers always do


Every time I hear you sayin' goodbye
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just to make it clear
That I'm fine with or without you


I should have known that you are a game to play
Players only love you when they're playing
So you better keep playing 'cause I'm getting my groove on


I'm getting my groove on


Every time I hear you sayin' goodbye
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just to make it clear
That I'm fine with or without


You may think that you know me oh
But let me tell you that you don't
It's a mystery to me
We have a history yeah


Every time I hear you sayin' goodbye
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just to make it clear
That I'm fine with or without you

Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down eat you alive
Just like animals animals like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals animals like animals-mals


Baby I'm
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you


Yeah you can start over you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me
But no


Baby I'm
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you


Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh


Baby I'm
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you


Yeah you can start over you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me
But no
Well buckle up because here are the uncensored lyrics of "Burnin' It Down" by Jason Aldean:


You slip your finger through the tear
In my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin' cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing a love song if I tried
Couldn't run straight if I tried


I'm-a burn one and turn one all night
I'm-a hold you and touch you and we'll be alright
Cause tonight we burn it down
Oh we burnin' it down


Pick up trucks slow rolling
With a couple jacked up
We'll be hanging out in the glow of the midnight moon
And even if we're just dancing in the dark
We'll be shining



I'm-a burn one and turn one all night
I'm-a hold you and touch you and we'll be alright
Cause tonight we burn it down
Oh we burnin' it down


It's about damn time to live it up
And if you agree say yeah
Yeah yeah


I'm-a burn one and turn one all night
I'm-a hold you and touch you and we'll be alright
Cause tonight we burn it down
Oh we burnin' it down
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Play It Again" by Luke Bryan:

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin' no way she ain't got one
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is

She was like come here boy I wanna dance
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And I said play it again play it again play it again

I'd have gave that DJ twenty bucks
If he'da played it just a little bit longer
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it I love it I want some more of it
I said play it again play it again play it again

The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You shoulda seen her smile when I brought out my guitar
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is

She was like come here boy I wanna dance
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And I said play it again play it again play it again

I'd have gave that DJ twenty bucks
If he'da played it just a little bit longer
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it I love it I want some more of it
I said play it again play it again play it again

The way she looked at me that way
That lettin' go I can't escape
I'm not complainin'
But I can't lie
I wanna hear it again 'cause

She was like come here boy I wanna dance
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And I said play it again play it again play it again

I'd have gave that DJ twenty bucks
If he'da played it just a little bit longer
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it I love it I want some more of it
I said play it again play it again play it again

Play it again
Play it again
Play it again

Give me all that you got now
Make you want me cause I'm hot now
I'm gone so faded I'm on one
Bang bang pop off like a long gun


If you a lame nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded turn up with the big boys
Live fast die young that's my choice
Get money get money like an invoice
We can mob all in the whip
Make the money make a grip

Gettin' faded til we trip

Said that I won't turn it down
I'm the illest bitch around
I'mma hit you hit you from the back

Oh no I don't need a hand
No no I could be your man
I ain't talking two seater
But it's 'bout to go down
Yeah I'm talking about that pound
And I'm talking about that bass
Beats knocking harder than the headboards
Started from the bottom but I'm headed to the top
Niggas hanging on my whistle
Tell them pitch it to Lincecum
Don't I get it shawty
Already got my pin number money


If you a lame nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded turn up with the big boys
Live fast die young that's my choice

Look where we came huh

Bitches gettin' messy with it we the ones chosen
The West Coast gettin' boring so I'ma make the most of it


If you a lame nigga you ain't making no noise

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlights dance with your boots in it 
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your cornfield whiskey bonfires on it


You bet your life on it
Feels like you're flying
Feels like you're dying and you're never coming back
You're in your element fertilizing
My hands your hands dirt on our hands
It feels like freedom it feels like Alabama
Feels like home if you're gonna drive it like that


You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Angels in the clay mud play with you in it
You light her name in it
Drop your sweat in it
Swear this is where you buried all your secrets


You bet your life on it
Feels like you're flying
Feels like you're dying and you're never coming back
You're in your element fertilizing
My hands your hands dirt on our hands
It feels like freedom it feels like Alabama
Feels like home if you're gonna drive it like that

It feels like home if you're gonna drive it like that
It feels like home if you're gonna drive it like that

Till the love runs out till the love runs out
All I need is a little love in my life  
All I need is a little love in the dark  
A little but I’m hoping it might kick-start  
Me and my broken heart  

I need a little loving tonight  
Hold me so I'm not falling apart  
A little but I’m hoping it might kick-start  
Me and my broken heart  

Yeah  

Shotgun aimed at my heart you got one  
Tear me apart in this song  
How do we call this love  

I try to run away But your eyes  
Tell me to stay oh why why would you  

My broken heart shows that I'm not immune  
I can't escape I'm trapped in it I'm doomed  
I know I'm not the only one  
Who is willing to keep it Pumpin’  

I need a little loving tonight  
Hold me so I'm not falling apart  
A little but I’m hoping it might kick-start  
Me and my broken heart  

I need a little loving tonight  
Hold me so I'm not falling apart  
A little but I’m hoping it might kick-start  
Me and my broken heart

Yellow dog school bus kickin' up red dust
Pickin' us up by a barbed wire fence

Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids

Growin' up in little pink houses
Makin' out on living room couches
Blowin' that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up but we're all alright

Bouncing around boots on the ground
Always up for a good time
Dancing on and off the town
Drinking on a Bud Light

We were Jesus save me blue jean baby

Trailer park truck stop faded little map dots

We were teenage dreamin' front seat leanin'
Baby come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone

Learnin' to smile even when I was fallin' down
Daddy had a hard hand and Momma always prayed
And yeah I guess I'm a little bit like them

You can be amazing you can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you I wanna see you be brave

Everybody's been there everybody's been stared down
By the enemy
Fallen for the fear and done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don't run stop holding your tongue
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Verse 1:

A couple tickets all-inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Chorus:
Buyin' drinks for everybody but the pilot it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is something sexy leaning pouring Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition got a little mile-high flirtatious with her

Verse 2:
Ain't a cloud in the sky and got a seat in first class
I'm all drunk on a plane
On my way to Margaritaville
Forgetting everything that hits me right in the feels

Chorus:
Buyin' drinks for everybody but the pilot it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is something sexy leaning pouring Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition got a little mile-high flirtatious with her

Bridge:
And I'm sorry I'm not there for all your birthdays
I'm sorry that I ain't listenin' been busy all burnin' candles both ends for too long
And I hope that you forgive me you know I love you all to the moon and the stars and back again

Chorus:
Buyin' drinks for everybody but the pilot it's a party

Outro:
Yea I'm the dude I'm gettin' drunk on a plane

There's a couple people sitting at the bar
No one's really talkin' no one's really far
Didn't come with anyone but I know why I'm here
Been taking shots with strangers but all I see is you right now

And all I'm thinkin' 'bout is oh oh oh
Why you gotta be so oh oh oh oh
Cool when I'm about to lose control
Why you gotta be why you gotta be why you gotta be so

But you know I don't mind at all
'Cause when you look at me and I look back

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics to "La La La" by Naughty Boy featuring Sam Smith:


La la la la la la la na na na na na
La la na na la la la la la na na na na na

Hush don't speak
When you spit your venom keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire


I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech it's tiring
Enough is enough


I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing I go la la la
I'm turning off the volume when you speak
'Cause if my heart can't stop it I find a way to block it I go la la la


La la la la la la la na na na na na
La la na na la la la la la na na na na na



I find peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been silent for too long


I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech it's tiring
Enough is enough


I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing I go la la la
I'm turning off the volume when you speak
'Cause if my heart can't stop it I find a way to block it I go la la la

I'm turning off the volume when you speak
'Cause if my heart can't stop it I find a way to block it I go la la la

The one that I need
Can't keep my hands off you

Got a lot of rhythm in my soul

Oh oh

I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat
Yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good
Selective memory the way you make me feel yeah
You gotta hold on me
I never met someone so different oh here we go
You a part of me now you a part of me
So where you go I follow follow follow

I can't remember to forget you
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh oh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooooh

I'd rob and I'd kill to keep him with me
I'd do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'd do anything for that boy
Oh oh
I'm addicted no lie
And I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one

And that's why when we kiss it's so relieving
I'm not even mine I'm yours
And I can't deny I'm addicted to ya alright
I'm addicted to ya alright
Yeah here we go again
Addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Wah-wah-wah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Can't remember to forget you

I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh oh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooooh

I can't remember to forget ya
I can't remember to forget ya
I can't remember to forget ya

I can't remember to forget you
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me the only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh oh oh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooooh
Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Amnesia" by 5 Seconds of Summer:

I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy yeah it hurts that you've moved on

It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened was it just a lie
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
And the memories I never can escape

'Cause I'm not fine at all

I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ohOh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ohOh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ohOh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh

I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia

And forget about the stupid little thingsand forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to youand the memories I never can escape
And the memoriesI never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

No I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

Woah woah
Woah woah
Woah woah
I ain't tryna hear what you sayin'
I'm the law around here y'all just playin'
King of the town yeah they crown me
Missed a spot run it back like an athlete
Lookin' at me like you want a piece of it
But that big talk ain't cheap all I get is cheese
Don't be mad at me might wanna reevaluate
Where you are in life and try again bruh
You can keep on doubting look at how that turned out
Tryna see the Louie I ain't tryna see the burnout
Hit the stage walk away with a big check
Blowin' out my phone y'all need to give that a rest
I'm from the bottom nothin' was handed to me
I wear chains with my chest out you can't stand to see
I'm my own boss ain't no one above
Suckas like y'all still livin' with your moms cause you ain't got love
I'm not mediocre

I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me she don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me believe me


I'm that nigga boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all believe me
I guess that's why they say I'm king
And everybody love me
And I ain't gotta tell a lie 'bout nothing
I put that on my Yankee hat
I'm good I'm straight keep a nigga irate
So much hate I need a AK
Now we'll let that K spray
I'm finna kill it I'm finna be the only one
To make you feel it – you scarier than a lion's cave
I'm flyer than an airplane
And now these niggas claim to be hot but I'm Trinidad James


I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me she don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me believe me


I'm the only one that's popping
I'm the only one they want
I'm the only one that's dropping a new Ferrari coupe
And it's lime green – and it's looking like it's snotting
But you know I'm getting all about the money
I ain't done yet you gotta know I'm too slick
Shiny butter tell 'em stick to the subject
Big up my bread smell like it's a pumper
Meaning I'm a big deal
And I'm the only one that they follow
I'm the Ferrari my bro is the Bugatti
And my homie Lil Wayne is a gonna
Believe me believe me or not


I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me she don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me believe me

Ah-ha
I'm in the club high off purp with some shades on
Tatted up mini skirt with my J's on


Ya ya ya ya
I be in the club droppin' dollars
Ya ya ya ya
I'm a rich girl wearin' real diamonds
Throwin' up some semi precious stones
Whatchu gon' do when I appear
Whatchu gon' do when I appear
When I premiere


Uh goddammit feel like I'm Kobe
Smoke so much I need to be drug tested
Niggas takin' game three seconds
Bitch I'm with the gang you know we reppin'
Taylor Gang it's the army
Better yet the navy
Doctors of the dope fuck with us or get drug out
We bringin' 'em out
It's a lot of dope I'm just flexin'
Ain't gotta touch a mill I'm just blessed I'm the waviest


Ya ya ya ya
I be in the club droppin' dollars
Ya ya ya ya
I'm a rich girl wearin' real diamonds
Throwin' up some semi precious stones
Whatchu gon' do when I appear
Whatchu gon' do when I appear
When I premiere


Trippy nigga blue and yellow my coupe is a wreck
My dreads is a nest for a robin' and they next
I'm at the top of the pyramid pussy
And it's evident everyday my life's a chitty chitty bang bang
A nigga tryna rob me he just gon' bang bang
A lot of niggas hatin' on me but they keep watchin'
Ha check the bank statements it's evident
That I'm gettin' money the realest nigga outta Memphis
I'm killin' these niggas Mike Will fuck these niggas aye
When I step up in the club I'm like who you with
Gotta watch them niggas that be talkin' to the po-pos
Say they called for backup when they see me they don't breathe


Ya ya ya ya
I be in the club droppin' dollars
Ya ya ya ya
I'm a rich girl wearin' real diamonds
Throwin' up some semi precious stones
Whatchu gon' do when I appear
Whatchu gon' do when I appear
When I premiere


I'm in the club high on purp' with some shades on
Tatted up mini skirt with my J's on
Ya man on my coochie he thinkin' 'bout me
He payin' me and he gon' continue 'cause he a fan
We got liquor by the boatload
Disrespect the Lyfe that's a no-no
All my niggas dressed in that rojo
I ride for my guys that's the bro code
Baby get me high let me smoke though
I'm a rich gangsta got the gold roll
Hit the gas and we peel out on the rooooad
Floor seats in Miami Heat game on
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
Tried to do it how I do it they can't do it like me
I'm the shit I'm the queen can't dispute it boo
Verse 1:
White sand cold can of beer
Sunset I can feel it here
Thirsty the way you look at me
Beachin' that's what I want to be

Chorus:
I remember now
How the salty water taste oh ya
Put my lips on yours
And I could see us on the waves goin' back and forth and back
And forth again
I need to see you like I've never seen you before
I wanna see you on the beach
That's where I wanna be

Verse 2:
Tangled up in a blanket it's just you and me
And baby don't worry about a thing
'Cause if the sun gets too hot we'll find the shade
And if the water's too cold we'll adjust that accordingly hey

Chorus:
I remember now
How the salty water taste oh ya
Put my lips on yours
And I could see us on the waves goin' back and forth and back
And forth again
I need to see you like I've never seen you before
I wanna see you on the beach
That's where I wanna be

Bridge:
And we'll watch the sun
Disappear into the water
'Cause there's nothing else for us to do
In a place this cool

Chorus:
I remember now
How the salty water taste oh ya
Put my lips on yours
And I could see us on the waves goin' back and forth and back
And forth again
I need to see you like I've never seen you before
I wanna see you on the beach
That's where I wanna be

I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free


I said a little bit of money and a house made of gold
A few more things that I can call my own
But truly I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the dollar or the man or the royalty


Pedal to the floor feel like I'm headed for the ages
Out of control swervin' all over the road
Lookin' back thinkin' 'bout the days that I wasted
I see the finish line and my head is held high I blaze it
We are proud we are one with the undefeated
Never defeated always undefeated
Loyalty is royalty that's what I believe in
So tell me why the hell I feel like I'm fightin' demons


I said a little bit of money and a house made of gold
A few more things that I can call my own
But truly I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the dollar or the man or the royalty


Black faces white suits
Ridin' shotgun wit' a black Glock
But that's not new stupid mothafucka
It's the black putt nothin' but black guts
All in my steering wheel the wrist icy and my bitch bad
But I'm losing control my fears grabbin' me by the hand
So I stay strapped up and I never lackin'
And keep my demons in my past like a motherfuckin' Hasid
See no one put me on in this cold world alone
So I had to buy me a new fur to stay warm
Foe friends they ain't real friends
I learned that in the end when it all falls down no need to pretend
Like "fuck it" when they envy all the things you possess
But that's just the way shit goes in the world that we in


I said a little bit of money and a house made of gold
A few more things that I can call my own
But truly I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the dollar or the man or the royalty


Truly we are the stay at home type
Let the poison be the poison let the medicine be the medicine
Truly we are the stay at home type
Let the poison be the poison let the medicine be the medicine


I said a little bit of money and a house made of gold
A few more things that I can call my own
But truly I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the dollar or the man or the royalty
Hey hey hey hey

Hey hey hey hey

Simmer down simmer down

They say we're too young now to amount to anything else

But look around

We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now

If you don't swim you'll drown

But don't move honey

You look so perfect standing there

In my American Apparel underwear

And I know now that I'm so down

Your lipstick stain is a work of art

I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart

And I know now that I'm so down

Hey Hey Hey Hey

Hey Hey Hey Hey

Let's get out let's get out

'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down

While I was out I found myself alone just thinking

If I showed up with a plane ticket

And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it

Would you wanna run away too

'Cause all I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there

In my American Apparel underwear

And I know now that I'm so down

Your lipstick stain is a work of art

I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart

And I know now that I'm so down

Hey Hey Hey Hey

Hey Hey Hey Hey

You look so perfect standing there

In my American Apparel underwear

And I know now that I'm so down

Your lipstick stain is a work of art

I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart

And I know now that I'm so down

Hey Hey Hey Hey

Hey Hey Hey Hey

You look so perfect standing there

In my American Apparel underwear

And I know now

Hey Hey Hey Hey

Hey Hey Hey Hey
All night all night

Sorry I didn't mean to do it's just that there's no way that you can move

When you're underneath the floorboards I'm gonna stay the night give you everything
I have all night

So take me home like you're my home
I'll be your hero and I'll be your saint
You'll be my angel and you'll be my saint
I'll be your hero and I'll be your saint
I'll stay with you and I'll stay with you all night
Tonight

Until you're mine until the end of time

I won't give up no I won't give in
Until you're mine until the end of time

So take me home like you're my home
I'll be your hero and I'll be your saint
You'll be my angel and you'll be my saint
I'll be your hero and I'll be your saint
I'll stay with you and I'll stay with you all night
Tonight

All night all night
All night all night

So take me home like you're my home
I'll be your hero and I'll be your saint
You'll be my angel and you'll be my saint
I'll be your hero and I'll be your saint

I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you baby
But this song so fucking dope girl it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
But it's cool I'm still feeling faded


I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout my crazy-ass life
I done been through the ups and downs had a couple crashes
Didn't know which way to go but I still kept mashin'
While haters steady jockin' tryna knock me off of my passion
On my way to the liquor store kinda drunk off a four
I was trippin' over memories way I been makin' my foes
These other rappers boring me I'm oh so scoring
Top of the mountaintop you can't hear me too damn important
And I'm dabbin' with my team rockin' X's and O's
I'm choked up my big homie gone but I ain't cryin' no
But you can see it in my eyes went through flashbacks before
Made it out the hood now I'm makin' moves that they can't ignore
I'm just tryna be the man not the boy every time
I'm just tryna live my life but they hate that every time
So I'm witcha more than ever and I'd die for the throne
I'm a king lil' nigga both parents dead that was my dream


I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you baby
But this song so fucking dope girl it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
But it's cool I'm still feeling faded


I belong to the world don't ever judge me
Put your arms around me what's it all about to ya
I belong to the game I put my all into ya
Same thing different day ain't shit good in the hood
I'm runnin' through these checks 'til I pass out pass out
I'm runnin' through these checks 'til I pass out pass out
I swear to God all I do is cash out all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a ho get up off my trap house get up off my trap house
I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade fifth grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made eightball
Jukebox graduate would work for minimum wage jukebox
Ain't shit changed just the age man the game's still the same jukebox


I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you baby
But this song so fucking dope girl it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
But it's cool I'm still feeling faded

Fuck bein' on some chill shit

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "I Don't Dance" by Lee Brice:

I'll never settle down
That's what I always thought
Yeah I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone
I don't dance But here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It Ain't my style But I don't care
I'd do anything
With you anywhere
Guess you got me in the palm of your hand
'Cause I don't dance

Love's never come my way
I've never been this far
'Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart
No I don't dance But here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It Ain't my style But I don't care
I'd do anything
With you anywhere
Guess you got me in the palm of your hand
'Cause I don't dance

You got me in the palm of your hand
'Cause I I don't dance

No I don't dance But here I am
Spinning you around and around in circles
It Ain't my style But I don't care
Well I'd do anything
With you anywhere
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hand
'Cause I don't dance

'Cause I don't dance
No oh
Verse 1:
Stand on the box stomp your feet start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Pull out the matches bring on the gasoline
Pour on the peroxide gotta set it free
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Chorus:
There's a real good chance that the flame will spread
Catch it in the middle of the night when you're half asleep
If you're out for blood gotta get it done
If you're gonna take a chance better take it all
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Verse 2:
Need a little danger to light up my veins
Don't just wanna taste it I wanna swallow it whole
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Burning like a beacon in the middle of the night
No way I'm gonna turn it off gonna turn it on
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Chorus:
There's a real good chance that the flame will spread
Catch it in the middle of the night when you're half asleep
If you're out for blood gotta get it done
If you're gonna take a chance better take it all
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Bridge:
I wanna be reckless wanna be wild
Wanna tell everyone that I'm your girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Chorus:
There's a real good chance that the flame will spread

If you're out for blood gotta get it done

And when you say you need me

Boy I adore you

Baby can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you

But when you're near me

Of men armed with weapons hey oh 

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more 

Boy I adore you
I adore you

I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity you and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony

God knew exactly what He was doing when
He led me to you 

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more 

Boy I adore you

But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night oh

Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse
Why give a bitch your inch

You all about her and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch no flamingos

I can provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Habits Stay High" by Tove Lo as requested:


I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything I'm restless
Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all


I get home I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Days kind of lonely
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind


Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind


Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down gotta stay high
All my life to forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh


Pick up daddies at the playground
How I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown
Make 'em feel alive
Oh make it fast and greasy
I'm numb and way too easy
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind


Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind


High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Spending my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you


Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
If you want it take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better deeper
I was under your spell
Like a deadly fever yeah babe
On the highway to hell yeah

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

No more baby ooh
Thought on your body
I came alive it was lethal
It was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh baby

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better deeper
I was under your spell
Like a deadly fever yeah babe
On the highway to hell yeah

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

Lil' bruh what you want lil' bruh
[Intro Buyin' pistols sellin' dope and smokin' weed
In the driveway drinkin' Henny make it bleed

I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made
Jaja taught me flip them packs and how to maintain
Get that money back and spend it on the same thing
Shorty like the way that I ball out
I be gettin' money time to call out
You see the drop-top you see us ballin'
Lil' bruh I'm young and I'm heartless
I'm a problem to society police crooked
Street smart nigga I'm a hood scholar
I'm a problem to society police crooked

My niggas tote hammers and we'll let 'em bang
If you want some beef then my niggas click they bangs
40 gloccs extendos for the gang
And bro bring them things he a fool with the aim
OG Bobby be safe and stay dangerous
FREE BREEZY Cannot forget Splurge
Da Da Rider Keep it filthy rich like Richie
Gulliani my niggas move militant

I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade

Nigga with an attitude I feel like O'Shea
Walkin' with my vatos choppos on a b-day
Beard gang till I die I'm an OG
Narcotics on the watch never OD
Got me 20 on the neck
Hunned racks on the wrist
And if a nigga disrespect
Put them racks on his head
Just bought a new whip
Got the drop on the block
All-white Maserati nigga racing the cops

I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made

My nigga my nigga My ace-boon-coon coon
My nigga my nigga My motherfuckin' niggas

First things first I fuck get all the money
Bitches love me keep it hunnid
Niggas hatin' on me cause I'm chosen from the dungeon
I ain't scared fuck you all got my gun all my bullies
I've been hearin' lots of rumors 'bout a nigga like me
Talkin' lots of shit can't go to the city
But if you need to know I'm a GD
Ride for my niggas let the mothafuckin' 40 bang
I do this for my niggas not the fame
Still in the hood make 'em call me by my name
And I ain't never changed but the cash and the fame
Some people get shady and forget where they come from
Well I ain't ever had to go and change on my dawgs


I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas

I said fuck a new friend I don't need that I don't need that
Don't want to be cool man I got plaques
We done did it now it's turnin' like a boss
If you ain't my nigga like family then you lost
Off top will smith and martin lawrence
I'm in the Porsche smokin' weed dippin' from the lawman 12
No rookies on my team ain't no rook to your boy
And we ride for each other as simple as that
Kill for each other as simple as that
Came from bottom and never went back
You could put that on my riches facts


I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my niggas
My nigga my nigga My motherfuckin' niggas
My nigga my nigga My ace-boon-coon coon
My nigga my nigga My motherfuckin' niggas
My nigga my nigga My ace-boon-coon coon


And I ain't takin' no shorts no losses
For what nigga I do it for my bosses
And my foundation family and my closest
Nigga we gettin' money fuck fame
I'm in the game nigga fuck game
I'm certified with these hood credentials
Gotta be official 'cause the trap it can get mental
I'ma say this shit again I'ma say it with my chest out
If you're looking for the queen bitch I'ma bring your head out
I'm the west coast secret weapon I'm the bomb
Don't make me go back to the old me

Verse 1:
She sees them walking in a straight line
That's not really her style
And they all got the same heartbeat
But hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could
Ever bring them down
Yeah they're invincible and she's just in the background

Chorus:
And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Cause all the cool kids they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids like the cool kids

Verse 2:
He sees them talking with a big smile
But they haven't got a clue
Yeah they're living the good life
Can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars
But they don't know where they're going
In the fast lane living life without knowing

Chorus:
And he says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Cause all the cool kids they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids like the cool kids

Bridge:
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Cause all the cool kids they seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids like the cool kids

Chorus:
And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Cause all the cool kids they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids like the cool kids

Outro:
I wish that I could be like
I wish that I could be like
I wish that I could be like the cool kids

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy yeah you think I'm crazy


I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake and eat it too and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink used it as a tool when I blew steam Ooh
Hit the lottery oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink; Ironic 'cause I think
I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
'Cause I'm


I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy yeah you think I'm crazy


Well that's nothing


Now I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody
Once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over
Tomorrow so I keep conjuring sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah ponder it do you want this
'Cause I'm frazzled and I'm restless and this bit of passion's actually ugh
It's a gift and a curse isn't it Ha ha
Those lyrics are courtesy of Azlyrics
I got a ticket to get to the top
So I can see my whole world from up there
I'll try to figure out why I'm so scared
Of being up here oh
But for now I'm young so let me lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing I can see
Love to be in the arms of all I'm keeping here with me
Uh it's hot outside
Let me go inside
Somethin' cool Water fight
Twerk it out Be free
Come and join me
I ain't bougie I ain't like that
I'll show you how to renovate
Yo casa su casa amigo
No tienes que irte you can stay
All day it's summertime
Sippin' on Corona lime
And we feelin' like oh whoa whoa yeah
So put some new shoes on and get away from it all
It's been a stressful week oh yeah
But now we kick back and enjoyin' just you and me
And our love to come back fresh and rejuvenated
Baby you know that I miss that but I'm waiting
For the perfect time to call you back
And let you know what's on my mind
It's been a while and I think that it's time
I get a little bit of you in my life
I get a little bit of you in my life
And I don't want it to go away
I need somebody and I don't wanna wait
I can't help it I'm addicted to your love babe
Got a fetish for the things that you do
Oh whoa whoa yeah
Tonight you're mine baby
Oh whoa whoa yeah
Tonight you're mine baby
And I'ma put it on you heavy
Splash let's take a water break
Ease your mind lemme ease your mind
Splash let's take a water break
And we can play in the water like a whale
Oh whoa whoa yeah
Tonight you're mine baby
Oh whoa whoa yeah
Tonight you're mine baby
And I'ma put it on you heavy
All I am providing you is the uncensored lyrics to "Sweater Weather" by The Neighbourhood:

All I am is a man  
I want the world in my hands  
I hate the beach but I stand  
In California with my toes in the sand  
Use the sleeves of my sweater  
Let's have an adventure  
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered  
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours  
You in those little high-waisted shorts oh  
She knows what I think about  
And what I think about  
One love two mouths  
One love one house  
No shirt no blouse  
Just us you find out  
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about no  
'Cause it's too cold  
For you here  
And now so  
Let me hold  
Both your hands in the holes  
Of my sweater  
And if I may just take your breath away  
I don't mind if there's not much to say  
Sometimes the silence guides our minds  
To move to a place so far away  
The goosebumps start to raise  
The minute that my left hand meets your waist  
And then I watch your face  
Put my finger on your tongue  
'Cause you love to taste yeah  
These hearts adore  
Everyone the other beats hardest for  
Inside this place is warm  
Outside it starts to pour  
Coming down one love two mouths  
One love one house  
No shirt no blouse  
Just us you find out  
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about no no no  
'Cause it's too cold  
For you here  
And now  
So let me hold  
Both your hands in the holes  
Of my sweater  
'Cause it's too cold  
For you here  
And now  
So let me hold  
Both your hands in the holes  
Of my sweater  
Of my sweater  
Of my sweater
