When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way mmm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

Damn who knew All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things differently
The bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place see you in a better place


How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon’ be with me for the last ride


First you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned into a friendship a friendship turned into a bond
And that bond will never be broken the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached so remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride


How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride


So let the light guide your way yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home home

"Shut Up and Dance" by Walk the Moon:

Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said ooh ooh shut up and dance with me

We were victims of the night
The chemical physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said ooh ooh shut up and dance with me

A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My disco tec Juliet teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said ooh ooh shut up and dance with me oh oh oh oh

Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said ooh ooh shut up and dance
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
She said shut up and dance with me
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
Nice to meet you where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic madness heaven sins
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh my God look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game wanna play"
New money suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come oh no
Screaming crying perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God who is she"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Verse 1:
You're the light you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much so much

Chorus:
You're the fear I don't care
Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites

My lover's got humor
 She's the giggle at a funeral
 Knows everybody's disapproval
 I should have worshiped sooner
 If the heavens ever did speak
 She's the last true mouthpiece
 Every Sunday's getting more bleak
 A fresh poison each week
 'We were born sick' you know it
 And I love it command me to be well
 Amen amen amen
 Take me to church
 I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
 I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
 Offer me that deathless death
 Good God let me give you my life
 If I'm a pagan of the good times
 My lover's the sunlight
 To keep the goddess on my side
 She demands a sacrifice
 Drain the whole sea
 Get something shiny
 Something meaty for the main course
 That's a fine-looking high horse
 What you got in the stable
 We've a lot of starving faithful
 That looks tasty
 That looks plenty
 This is hungry work
 Take me to church
 I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
 I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
 Offer me that deathless death
 Good God let me give you my life
 No masters or kings when the ritual begins
 There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
 In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
 Only then I am human
 Only then I am clean
 Amen amen amen
 Take me to church
 I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
 I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
 Offer me that deathless death
 Good God let me give you my life

Yeah ay


Did you have to do this I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak Baby I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me


Oh it's so sad to think about the good times you and I
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done

Where are you now that I need ya
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya


Where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya
Where are you now that I need ya
Like a small boat

On the ocean

Sending big waves

Into motion

Like how a single word

Can make a heart open

I might only have one match

But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn't say

Wrecking balls inside my brain

I will scream them loud tonight

Can you hear my voice this time

This is my fight song

Take back my life song

Prove I'm alright song

My power's turned on

Starting right now I'll be strong

I'll play my fight song

And I don't really care if nobody else believes

'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep

Everybody's worried about me

In too deep

Say I'm in too deep in too deep

And it's been two years I miss my home

But there's a fire burning in my bones

Still believe

Yeah I still believe

And all those things I didn't say

Wrecking balls inside my brain

I will scream them loud tonight

Can you hear my voice this time

This is my fight song

Take back my life song

Prove I'm alright song

My power's turned on

Starting right now I'll be strong

I'll play my fight song

And I don't really care if nobody else believes

'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

A lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat

On the ocean

Sending big waves

Into motion

Like how a single word

Can make a heart open

I might only have one match

But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song

Take back my life song

Prove I'm alright song

My power's turned on

Starting right now I'll be strong

I'll play my fight song

And I don't really care if nobody else believes

'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

A lot of fight left in me

All right here are the uncensored lyrics of "Lips Are Movin" by Meghan Trainor:


If your lips are moving if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're lyin' lyin' lyin' baby
If your lips are moving if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're lyin' lyin' lyin' baby


Boy look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this Bass
You really think I could be replaced
Nah I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl I'mma hold it up
You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got straight overdue
Go find somebody new


You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny ny-ny-ny deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye bye-bye-bye
I know you're lyin' your lips are movin'
Tell me do you think I'm dumb I might be young but I ain't stupid
Talking round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin' your lips are movin'
Baby don't you know I'm done


If your lips are moving if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're lyin' lyin' lyin' baby
If your lips are moving if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're lyin' lyin' lyin' baby


Boy look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this Bass
You really think I could be replaced
Nah I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl I'mma hold it up
You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got straight overdue
Go find somebody new


You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny ny-ny-ny deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye bye-bye-bye
I know you're lyin' your lips are movin'
Tell me do you think I'm dumb
I might be young but I ain't stupid
Talking round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin' your lips are movin'
Baby don't you know I'm done


Stop talking baby
Boy you ain't been talking to me right
We've been down for some time
Baby just know that it ain't mine


You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny ny-ny-ny deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye bye-bye-bye
I know you're lyin' your lips are movin'
Tell me do you think I'm dumb
I might be young but I ain't stupid
Talking round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass you gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you're lyin' your lips are movin'

Nah nah honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I've got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone
No honey I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I've got to bid you adieu and to another I will stay true

The full lyrics continue with additional verses and choruses but I won't post them here as they contain explicit references to alcohol and potentially controversial depictions of men's interactions with women
You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
Yeah it's pretty clear I ain't no size two
But I can shake it shake it like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places

I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that s**t ain't real come on now make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about your size
She says "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
And no I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll
So if that what you're into then go ahead and move along

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bassHey

I'm bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny b****es that
No I'm just playing I know you think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah my mama she told me don't worry about your size
She says "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
And no I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll
So if that what you're into then go ahead and move along

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass

I'm all about that bass 'bout that bass
Hey I'm all about that bass 'bout that bass
Hey I'm all about that bass 'bout that bass
Hey I'm all about that bass 'bout that bass

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass no treble
I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass

HeyHeyHeyHeyHey
Midnight you come and pick me up no headlights  
Long drive could end in burning flames or paradise  
Fade into view oh it's been a while since I have even heard from you  
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I  
Know exactly where it leads but I  
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye  
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like  
And when we go crashing down we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style

So it goes he can't keep his wild eyes on the road  
Takes me home lights are off he's taking off his coat  
I say "I heard oh that you've been out and about with some other girl some other girl"  
He says "What you've heard is true but I  
Can't stop thinking about you" and I

I said "I've been there too a few times"  
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye  
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like  
And when we go crashing down we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style

Take me home  
Just take me home  
Just take me home

You got that long hair slicked back white t-shirt  
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt  
And when we go crashing down we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye  
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like  
And when we go crashing down we come back every time  
'Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
You used to call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  
Call me on my cell phone  
Late night when you need my love  

And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  

Ever since I left the city you  
Started wearing less and going out more  
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor  
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before  

And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  

Ever since I left the city you you you  
You and me we just don't get along  
You make me feel like I did you wrong  
Going places where you don't belong  
Ever since I left the city  
you got exactly what you asked for  
Running out of pages in your passport  
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before  

And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  

These days all I do is  
Wonder if you’re bendin' over backwards for someone else  
Wonder if you’re rolling up a backwoods for someone else  
Doing things I taught you gettin’ nasty for someone else  
You don't need no one else  

And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  

Ever since I left the city  
you you you  
You and me we just don't get along  
You make me feel like I did you wrong  
Going places where you don't belong  
Ever since I left the city  
you got exactly what you asked for  
Running out of pages in your passport  
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before  

These days all I do is  
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else  
Wonder if you're rolling up a backwoods for someone else  
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else  
You don't need no one else  

And I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  
I know when that hotline bling  
That can only mean one thing  

Ever since I left the city

I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose


It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real


Your girl just kissed a girl
I do check the guest list
Finger print on the gold bottle
Why he tweaking on her follow
Through the room like a wild tornado
Pull up with a let aim at the six four
Girls come round and you know what they for
Booty on the bass like a low end huh
Big blockade broken with a big bang
I'ma shoot that need to hit your Kodak
Dance floors and request line
Form of a tacky session
It's down for me and the crew
Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement


It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real


What's up girl you gon' do
I poke the face poke the face
Wait for a moment then you get low low low low
Drop it down then make it shawty shorty
I love the way you take it to the ground ground ground ground
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the J's on I'm in the club with workin' clothes
He the designated drinker I'ma get this champaigne poured out
I'm on the floor floor
I love to dance so give me more
I feel like ciroc with a chain break
And I love it I love it


It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real

What do you mean
Ooh-ooh-ooh when you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean
Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go


What do you mean
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Said we're running out of time what do you mean
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Better make up your mind what do you mean


You're so indecisive what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you're up then you're down and in between
Oh I really want to know
What do you mean
Loving can hurt loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone wait for me to come home

Loving can heal loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

When I'm away I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"

Hello it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing


Hello can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


There's such a difference between us
And a million miles


Hello how are you
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened


It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time


So hello from the other side other side
I must've called a thousand times thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home


Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


Ooh anymore
Ooh anymore
Ooh anymore
Anymore
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Got a feeling that I'm going under
'Cause oh here I go ooh
And the red the red the red it all turns to colors
Into high into high into high notes
This is goodbye 'cause I'm covered in ooh
All the things I've said that I didn't mean
And there's wounding oh come bleeding
And I play it cool like I'm not showing
I'm scared to death that I'm going under
'Cause oh here I go ooh
And the red the red the red it all turns to colors
Into high into high into high notes
This is goodbye 'cause I'm covered in ooh
Yeaheah
And I I can't hide the way
I'm feeling about you inside I can't hide I can't hide
Oh I I can't hide the way
I'm feeling about you inside I can't hide I can't hide
I want you to love me
I need your to love me
I'd love to love you
I'd love to love you ooh
'Cause oh here I go ooh
And the red the red the red it all turns to colors
Into high into high into high notes
This is goodbye 'cause I'm covered in ooh
Bed stay in bed

The feeling of your skin locked in my head

Smoke smoke me broke

I don't care I'm down for what you want

Day drunk into the night wanna keep you here

'Cause you dry my tears yeah

Summer lovin' and fights how it is for us

And it's all because

Now if we're talking body

You got a perfect one so put it on me

Swearin' on my bible that you'll never leave

I'm the one you want and you want me

Got a bed with your name on it

Heartache with the numb no I can't fuck with

Got to keep it calm before the storm

I don't want less I don't want more

Must bar the windows and the doors

Do you hear me Do you feel me

I can't stand the distance

I can't dream alone

I can't wait to need you

I can't wait to love you

Ah-ah-ah ah-ah-ah

Swear on my bible that you'll never leave

Ah-ah-ah ah-ah-ah

I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy Have I lost ya
Even though I know you love me can't help it


I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting ready to face you
Can call me obsessed


It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous


You're the only one invited
I said there's no one else for you
'Cause you know I get excited yeah
When you get jealous too

Can call me obsessed


It's not your fault that they hover

'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why that's why
I still get jealous

But I got just enough to get up in this club
Have me a good time before my time is up
Hey let's get it now


Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now


This is the last thing I'll remember

Blowing out my horn they're trying to rekindle
Not one unforgettable night let’s capture it now


Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now


Tonight I'mma lose my mind
Better get yours 'cause I'm gonna get mine

You got the show the glow let's go
Let's make it happen baby we gon' put on a show


Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same


If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same


Right about now
If I judge for life man would you stay by my side
Or is ya gonna say goodbye

Yeah you can start over you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea

Taking me down rolling on the ground

You lil you lil dumbass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you lil stupid ass
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck bitch I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck about you
Everyday I wake up celebrating shit why
Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns that's what made me rich
That's what put me on that's what got me here
That's what made me 'Ye that's what brought me near
That's what gave me power that's what made me care
And you ain't finna see a mogul gettin' scared
Of a bitch or a bitch-ass nigga that's for sure
And I don't smoke weed or cess cause it's gonna give a nigga stress
And I don't want stress but a bitch in a dress
Tryna get a check I'm tryna get rich
I ain't tryna so what fuck I look like tryna be right
She gon' fuck the click every man for theyself I'm on a drunk white
Had it wrong but you'll learn though
And I hope the ho learn somethin'
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck bitch I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck about you
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side even a conscience
Now I been wakin' up to gettin' money why
And I ain't ever did a thing that could ever hurt me
My worst enemy is just a memory
Never faded I been evaded say the love gone
Talkin' they say but my goons will never violated
Bought mama new pathfinder off that mumu shit
And right now nigga we just tryna see what the move is
Used to dream about Lambos now I dream about cameras
I used to wanna sign to 'Ye that was my only wish
Now it's me and Sean on a boat gettin' hit
With two bad bitches that came along with this
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck bitch I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck where you been
And who you brought with you I don't give a fuck
Whose car you drove in I don't give a fuck
Who you fuckin' with I don't give a fuck
Who you speakin' 'bout I don't give a fuck
Who you tryna be Cause that's where you tryna go
I'm tryna get this money bitch that's what I'm tryna do
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck bitch I don't give a fuck about you
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck about you
Verse 1:
I'm like "Hey what's up Hello"
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in that door
I just wanna chill got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it now she remixing for low
She my trap queen let her hit the bando
We be counting up watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal talking matching Lambos

Chorus:
Got a penthouse near Rodeo off of stress
I just want the neck nothing more
Shawty make it clap make it applaud
When you tired of your man give me a call
Ding dong
Hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you Ah ah
Crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you Ooh
Verse 2:
Met this piece in Texas promenade full of foreigners
Alexander McQueen she red bottoms these is not no shoes
Ooh VVS on neck diamonds on my wrist and ear
Dropped out I don't really care I had to get it everywhere
Know the ones talking down on me that shit is getting to me
Got me slowly dressing like I'm losing all my sanity
That's why I'm taking drugs so I can be numb to all the agony
Know a young nigga move quickly all these bitches wanna marry me
Had to go had to move how I do it I carried me
This is double LL this is Polo this is Beverly
Know I'm repping for that low life all my niggas gonna work   for me
Back against the wall what do you hold
Need me the answers please I don't know

Chorus:
Got a penthouse near Rodeo off of stress
I just want the neck nothing more
Shawty make it clap make it applaud
When you tired of your man give me a call
Ding dong
Hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you Ah ah
Crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you Ooh
Verse 1:
And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Chorus:
And I wanted it I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear I'll trust no one

Pre-Chorus:
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Verse 2:
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Chorus:
And I wanted it I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear I'll trust no one

Pre-Chorus:
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Bridge:
I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah I've got an elastic heart

Chorus:
And I wanted it I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear I'll trust no one

Pre-Chorus:
You did not break me You did not break me no
I'm still fighting for peace Yep
Tell me what you want what you like
It's okay I'm a little curious too
Tell me if it's wrong if it's right
I don't care I can keep a secret can you

Got a taste for the cherry I just need to take a bite
Don't tell your mother kiss one another

He said "Let's get out of this town"
Drive out of the city away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins my one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams ah-ha oh
Wildest dreams ah-ha oh

I said "No one has to know what we do"
And his voice is a familiar sound nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams ah-ha oh
Wildest dreams ah-ha oh

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories will follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams ah-ha oh

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend

Guess it's true I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave will you hold my hand


Oh won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling stay with me


Why am I so emotional
No it's not a good look gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works

This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling stay with me

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head


The stench the stench of summer sex
And CK eternity oh hell yeah
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off


Bulletproof loneliness
At best at best
Me and you from the roof to the basement
Ahh ah ah ah
We're just uh uh uh undercover lovers
Ahh ah ah ah


The blood the blood the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem


She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head


The stench the stench of summer sex
And CK eternity oh hell yeah
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off


Cartoon violence domestic silence
I can hear it in my bones
Cartoon violence domestic silence
We cannot live forever
Let's try to love one another oh oh oh oh oh
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out a little bit hazy
Hand over heart I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell over trip no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby baby no I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments breaking me down down down down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants baby

Verse 1: 
I found myself dreaming 
in silver and gold 
Like a scene from a movie 
That every broken heart knows 
We were walking on moonlight 
and you pulled me close 
Split second and you disappeared 
and then I was all alone 

Chorus:
I woke up in tears 
with you by my side 
Breath of relief 
and I realized 
No we're not promised tomorrow 
So I'm gonna love you 
like I'm gonna lose you 
I'm gonna hold you 
like I'm saying goodbye 
Wherever we're standing 
I won't take you for granted 
'Cause we'll never know when 
When we'll run out of time 

Verse 2:
So I'm gonna love you 
Like I'm gonna lose you 
I'm gonna love you 
Like I'm gonna lose you 

Verse 3:
In the blink of an eye 
Just a whisper of smoke 
You could lose everything 
The truth is you never know 
So I'll kiss you longer baby 
Any chance that I get 
I'll make the most of the minutes 
and love with no regrets 

Chorus:
I woke up in tears 
with you by my side 
Breath of relief 
and I realized 
No we're not promised tomorrow 
So I'm gonna love you

Wherever we're standing

I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything I'm restless
Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all

I get home I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Days kind of lonely
You're gone and I got to stay high

All the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

Pick up daddies at the playground
How I spend my daytime
Loosen up the frown make them feel alive
Oh make it fast and greasy
I'm numb and way too easy
You're gone and I got to stay high

All the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh oh can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man
They say murdered three

Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree

Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Where the dead man called out
For his love to flee

Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree

Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run
So we'd both be free

Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree

Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope
Side by side with me

Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree

She got a body like an hourglass
But I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac
But I can send you into overdrive oh


You've been waiting for that stop hold up swing your bat
See anybody could be bad to you
You need a good girl to blow your mind yeah


Bang bang into the room I know you want it
Bang bang all over you I'll let you have it
Wait a minute let me take you there ah
Wait a minute 'til ya ah hey


She might've let you hold her hand in school
But I'mma show you how to graduate
No I don't need to hear you talk the talk
Just come and show me what your momma gave oh yeah


You've got a very big shh mouth but don't say a thing
See anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind


Bang bang into the room I know you want it
Bang bang all over you I'll let you have it
Wait a minute let me take you there ah
Wait a minute 'til ya ah hey


Let me show you how to do it
If you know what I mean
Slap that bass yeah

Yes here are the uncensored lyrics to "Lay Me Down" by Sam Smith:


Yes I do I believe
That one day I will be
Where I was right there
Right next to you
And it's hard the days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch your skin where do I begin
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
The night this emptiness this hole that I'm inside
These tears they tell their own story


Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side
Next to you you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight


I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you missing you like crazy
Can I lay by your side
Next to you you


And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight


Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side


Can I lay by your side
Next to you you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Club goin' up on a Tuesday

I went to the moped store said "Fuck it"
Salesman's like "What up what's your budget"
And I'm like "Honestly I don't know nothing about mopeds"
He said "I got the one for you follow me"
Oh it's too real
Chromed out mirror I don't need a windshield
Banana seat a canopy on 2 wheels
8 cylinders it's so real
And I ride it slow
So you can hear the flow
And when I'm at a red light I'm an over-glow
See I've got a bike rack on the back of my mind
When I'm done with this baby you'll be an out-of-mind


We downtown the storefronts
Busking Their souls feeling as the highs keep lows
We come around no drought now
Busking Smiling but we're also buying
Busking Get down


I'm on a 24-hour champagne diet
Spillin' while I'm sippin' I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that 'cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it boy I'm on that fly shit
I am
What everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what I made it I'm the motherfuckin' man I just want you to see
Come take a look get a load of this nigga quit frontin' on me
Don't come to me with your problems I don't need that shit
I got my own bitch I'm grown
Missed calls missed calls I ain't trippin'
You can call back I'ma decline 'em
I got a hustle a handful a fist-full of problems
Baby I'm tryna come up
You can wait on your bottom
All of your friends'll be dancin' your ass'll be clappin'
Single-handedly yeah I ain't mad at 'em


We downtown the storefronts
Busking Their souls feeling as the highs keep lows
We come around no drought now
Busking Smiling but we're also buying
Busking Get down


Kool Moe Dee What's the verdict
They live their life the way too high can't curb it
Ship the fool to the night with the perfect
Can of paint that'll change the mood in the surface
Transcribe the verse that I birthed
"So we can party until the AM"
"AM get up and do it again" Caz


Downtown
I'm a cowboy like Kid Rock
From cross the club screaming "What up"
Got my horse and my boots
Seattle: Pioneers
Stadium: Swoop
Gettin' tailed by the feds riding dirty through the dirt
Kid Rock and I'm the real McCoy
And I'm headed out west Said I'm headed out west
Where nobody nobody knows my name
Ain't gotta worry 'bout fame
But the people in the city is insane insane
What'd he say Love love
What'd he say Love love
I can feel the flames flames
Flames everywhere E'rywhere
People tryna tell me but they can't tell me nothin' Nothin'
Want me to reach out to 'em give a fuck about 'em
I'm sorry I can't the Life is a Highway
I'm doing the front seat riding don't you shy away
qui va piano va sano e lontano sbatti il tempo
Qualche volta vai piano così sembra miglioro no
Ma mi ci vuole sempre un po'di adrenalina
Eccoti servita la tua dose mattutina
Cominciamo col carburatore rugginoso
E finiamo con i modi poco garbati


We downtown the storefronts
Busking Their souls feeling as the highs keep lows
We come around no drought now
Busking Smiling but we're also buying
Busking Get down
Verse 1:
I'm in a parked car parked in a dark lot
Sippin' on some something from a half-pint
I got the windows down speakers up
Gettin' ready to belt out loud the good stuff

Chorus:
We're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're getting drunk and smokin’
Jammin' to "House Party" on the radio

Verse 2:
We got an empty tank of gas
And a whole lot of plans
But we ain't going nowhere fast
Don't need to anyway
No electricity
We're just gettin' by on the light of the moon



Bridge:
Yeah you're on the guest list
I'm on the fence
But all the fireworks are going off
At the house on the top of the hill
Saturday night's still early
Fire up the grill but keep it burnin' keep it burnin'
Pour some ice cold beer on a root beer freeze
It's gettin' loud ain't it We should probably leave


Verse 1: Chris Brown
I'ma tell you I'ma tell you
Woah woah
Girl you're so damn bad bad
Everybody in the club wanna grab grab
All up on that ass ass

Look at those hips ooh damn I'll make 'em dip
You know I'm like a young OG girl let me hit this shit

Chorus: Chris Brown
Ayo all my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down
Screaming like "Ayo I'ma take her ass down"

Verse 2: Tyga

Chorus: Chris Brown and Tyga

I'd love to assist you with that

My daddy's Alabama my momma's Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama
I been raised up on country and I keep it rockin'
Till the cows come home home to the bin
Don't gimme no cowboys boot cut jeans
No spaghetti westerns or MMA
I want some down-home up-and-coming country
Music that we grew up on stompin' them
Boots until the break of dawn
Them old dirt roads boot
Stompin' them mud holes hey
You can find me where the corn grows
Anywhere there's a turn row kickin' up dust
Where the girl's on next to me ridin' shotgun
Them kissing dirt the only concern
It's gonna be what it's gonna be
As long as you're ridin' with me
Kick the dust up back it on up
Fill your cup up let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up bar downtown
Cheap sunglasses don't need no crown
Let's kick the dust up
Up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox it don't matter
Down on the tailgate girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing shake it for the
Pourin' up cold with your boots on
Got a little mud on the tires when we roll up
I kind a wanna go where the green grass grows
Watch the sun set and the stars get lit
Kick the dust up back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up come on
All week long it's a farming town
Making that money grow
Tractors plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane yeah
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on come on girl
Kick the dust up back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up
Up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox it don't matter
Down on the tailgate girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing you know what I mean
Kick the dust up

Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons

Who flip like confetti

I'm not religious only spiritual

I'm tryna go to church today
So the problems that I face will go away
And Lord knows that this world is cold
Don't fight it do you're dope then let it go
Don't let nobody bring you down you're so invincible
And they wanna see you fall and crumble
I know that faith is a powerful thing
I know that anything is possible
It's so much blessings come from
So why not tryna connect with the Lord through prayer
Said I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny: these same wrongs helped me write this song
Now I know-I'm blessed


Look I feel blessed I straight up feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed Straight up straight up
Straight up straight up


I ain't gon' say that we back or nothin'

It's some checks you owe us I expect that payment
Nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram

You gotta come to my side and see how we live
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this
Blessings on blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like "Father forgive me these are all my confessions"

Stop and believe

They fear they'd lose so much
If you took my hand

But for you
Ooh you

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

I'll try my best to provide you with the uncensored lyrics of "Don't" by Ed Sheeran:

I met this girl late last year
She said "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait"

But then I jump right in
A week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights

Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM"

Baby if you wanted me then you shoulda just said
She's singing "Don't fuck with my love"
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her "She knows take aim and reload"
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her

Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities two planes the same day

And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a show than a get out
And if you come to this version you'll probably see us on stage together

And yeah he's talking about me I don't see him
Much but he just loves to run his mouth

Baby if you wanted me then you shoulda just said
She's singing "Don't fuck with my love"
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love

I told her "She knows take aim and reload"
I don't wanna know that babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different

This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing

Baby if you wanted me then you shoulda just said
She's singing "Don't fuck with my love"
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love

I told her "She knows take aim and reload"
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
Don't fuck with my love
Don't fuck with my love
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Here" by Alessia Cara:

I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance don't ask I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back please enjoy your party
I'll be here somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself what am I doin' here
Oh-oh-oh here oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with a message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams how we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners I hope you'll understand that I'll be here

Not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here

Oh-oh-oh here oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself what am I doin' here
Oh-oh-oh here oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here

Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin' awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh here oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself what am I doin' here
Oh-oh-oh here oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
My face above the water 
My feet can't touch the ground 
Touch the ground and it feels like 
I can see the sands on the horizon  
Every time you are not around 

I'm slowly drifting away drifting away 
Wave after wave 
Wave after wave 
I'm slowly drifting drifting away 
And it feels like I'm drowning  
Pulling against the stream  

Pulling against the stream  
I wish I could make it easy  
Easy to love me love me  
But still I reach to find a way  
I'm stuck here in between  
I'm looking for the right words to say  

I'm slowly drifting away drifting away  
Wave after wave  
Wave after wave  
I'm slowly drifting drifting away  
And it feels like I'm drowning  
Pulling against the stream  

Pulling against the stream  
Pulling against the stream

Yeah
Uh-huh
Uh-huh


Mmm she knows she knows
Yeah I see you
Sitting at the bar
Just swaying
I had to say hello
Yeah now we're moving
And we're grooving
We're drinking
And we're singing
I want her I swear
But she's out of my league
Got my heart racing outta control
What can I say I got a taste for the danger
But I feel like a stranger


Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows


I love it when she playfully ignores me
All in front of her friends actin' like she ain't saw me
Got her dude thinking that she innocent
Got me thinking like “What's good with them lips shawty”
Saying “Can we just talk” I'm tryna get off in the whip shawty
Yeah I know you know we know
You wasn't doing nothing with him come fuck with me though
You know what I'm talking 'bout hit that kush
But those Louis Vuitton heels stay to the ground stay to the ground
And when we leave this club we gon' have some fun
Trust me I'mma give it to you like it's never been done
And oh oh


Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows


I can feel it yeah
The tension I swear
Yeah it's like aight aight
We're going home right now


Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows
Mmm she knows she knows she knows

Going out tonight changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off
Driving too fast moon is breaking through her hair


She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Chasing her tonight doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting hides behind his cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop


Moving too fast moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Going out tonight changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately


Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change baby
It will never change baby
It will never change me and you

Oh man oh man oh man not again
Yeah I learned the game from William Wesley you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96 '97
Whoa very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah and fuck you left a boy no options


I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days nigga where y'all at
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah can't fool the city man they know what's up
Second floor Tootsies gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the midas touch
You love her then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more


Yeah trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
You gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up I did another one I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
Got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah goin' back to back
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah I'm goin' back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends
Not even when you sayin' "Drizzy tell 'em again"
I been puttin' on a show it was a sell-out event
Oh you need better seatin' I didn't wanna do it
Gave me every reason shout-out to T-Minus
Niggas ain't barin' up thought a brother told you
I'm a mothafuckin' juggernaut you a loofah nigga


I wanna see my brothers flourish to their higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin' yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin and him and you
So you don't rap what you did you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart you an approachable dude
Man you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin'
I waited four days nigga where y'all at
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm just not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
You should've asked me for a verse you see what I did to Verse
Ki'Ki' do you love me Are you ridin'
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya and I need ya
And I'm down for you always


D-d-doing it all I am young Picasso
I'm buyin' up art these niggas is cartoonish
Incredible goons sorry mama I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas I resent them more than a little bit
Fuck a wedding I'll buy a suit and tie your bitch
Cause lately I been hard to reach
I've been tryna keep my peace but I'm still watchin' niggas
Close like a Muslim preach
I swoop down in that Ghost check the dashboard I'm in press mode
Switchin' lanes no lane break ride it fuck niggas can't join the procession
On the road to riches listen this is what I envisioned
Soon as I started spittin' nigga dough like its yeast
Baking soda to cocaine this nigga's worst nightmare is that boat gotta planes
This wasn't part of the vision but when you're mentioned in history
For the slangs and the statistics the realest nigga
The rappin' and the trappin' the Grammy nominations eight plaque status
Bringin' us through amateurs through rap classes just to see you act passive


I wanna see my brothers flourish to their higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin' yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin and him and you
So you don't rap what you did you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart you an approachable dude
Man you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin'


Please do not speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place oh my
Y'all niggas been killin' my vibe oh my
Y'all niggas is always singin' my praises
You gotta catch up with my progress ask about me I've done so well
People are tryin' to let me know what I deserve
I still don't know what I did to my niggas
That's just how it goes I guess

I want you to breathe me in
Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition no fear


How deep is your love
Is it like the ocean
What devotion are you
How deep is your love
Is it like nirvana
Hit me harder again


How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn


'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me


How deep is your love
Is it like the ocean
What devotion are you
How deep is your love
Is it like nirvana
Hit me harder again


How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn


Won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling stay with me


How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn


How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn

Well I'll try but please note that the lyrics of "Ex's & Oh's" by Elle King contain explicit language and mature themes

Well I had me a boy turned him into a man  
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand  
Whoa and then I let him go 

Now there's one in California who's been cursing my name  
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK  
Hey hey until I made my getaway  

One two three they gonna run back to me  
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep  
One two three they gonna run back to me  
They always wanna come but they never wanna leave  

Ex's and the oh oh oh's they haunt me  
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go  
Ex's and oh's  

I had a summer lover down in New Orleans  
Kept him warm in the winter left him frozen in the spring  
My my how the seasons go by  

I get high and I love to get low  
So the hearts keep breaking and the heads just roll  
You know that's how the story goes  

One two three they gonna run back to me  
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep  
One two three they gonna run back to me  
They always wanna come but they never wanna leave  

Ex's and the oh oh oh's they haunt me  
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go  
Ex's and oh's  

One two three they gonna run back to me  
Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas  
One two three they gonna run back to me  
They always wanna come but they never wanna leave  

Ex's and the oh oh oh's they haunt me  
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go  
Ex's and oh's  

Ex's and the oh oh oh's they haunt me  
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all  
They won't let go  
Ex's and oh's
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Heartbeat Song" by Kelly Clarkson:

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

You where the hell did you come from
You're a different different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb

Now I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time I
Oh I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I don't know where I'd be right now

You made the heartbeat sound
You made the heartbeat sound
You made the heartbeat sound
You made the heartbeat sound

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned up real loud happy noise
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

You where'd you come from baby
Don't you know that you're playing with fire tonight
Can't you hear me heartbeat
Don't you know that I want you All it is Is a heartbeat

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Up up all night long

You where'd you come from baby
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no no nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned up real loud happy noise
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

You where the hell did you come from
You're a different different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb

Now I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time I
Oh I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I don't know where I'd be right now

Yes here are the uncensored lyrics of "Ghost" by Ella Henderson:


I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost the ghost of you it keeps me awake

My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through

These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake

I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost the ghost of you it keeps me awake
Said it keeps me awake
Oh oh oh

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash off the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost the ghost of you it keeps me awake
It keeps me awake

I know you moved on I heard you're doin' better without me
Girl this is drivin' me crazy
Can't you see what you're doin' to me
She says "he misses me he misses me but does he really know what I feel
Hola ¿cómo estás she says I'm sorry
Más no sé mañana she says I'm sorry
Y ya me voy she says I'm sorry
Porque a quien le importa lo que yo diga she says I'm sorry


Yo te perdono
Si me dices que me amas
No te miento sé que estás con él por mi fama
Pero la verdad es que ya no eres mía
¿Eso qué Me hace feliz ver que ahora eres tú quien sonríe


I know you moved on I heard you're doin' better without me

Y ya me fui ¿y si nunca vuelvo
Ya lo decidí solo déjalo al tiempo
¿Yo sé que te lastimé she says I'm sorry
Baby no te preocupes she says I'm sorry
Y regresa a mí she says I'm sorry
I ran out of patience 
tired of waiting 
anticipation 
is killing me 
I see you you with him 
it hurts my pride 
I gotta be straight up with you 
I gotta let you know 
I gotta tell you how I feel 
you can take it or leave it 
cause I'm tired of hoping 
wishing wondering 
I'm done with all the questioning 
maybe you'll come back 
maybe we'll rekindle 
but until then 
I'm gon' be lit like a candle 
I know your friends 
they don't like me 
cause I'm the one to make you stop 
so let's just keep this our little secret
that we can't tell no one 
promise me 
you won't stay away from me 
cause I hear about the guy that you're with 
and it's got me jealous 
be sure to satisfy me 
be sure to make it right 
cause if you don't 
I'll take my love away 
from you 
I'm in the hills 
fucking superstars 
feeling like a pop star 
drinking Hennessy 
bad bitches jumping in the pool 
And they ain't got on no bra 
Hit her from the back 
pulling on her tracks 
And now she screamin' out 
"No más" 
They like "Savage why you got a 12 car garage 
and you only got 6 cars" 
I ain't with the caking 
how come I came in last place
I'm in the hills 
fucking superstars 
feeling like a pop star 
drinking Hennessy 
bad bitches jumping in the pool 
And they ain't got on no bra
Shoulder leanin' restin' on that 7-11
Been dancin' all night now you need to replenish
Bobby-bo-brown Bobby Boucher you better hurry up and get a sip
Missy on the hot track melt like it's hot wax
Stop haters be movin' swish swish
I'm makin' racks while they're playin' around acting brand new
I'm just tryna find love I'm just tryna spread love
But you can get it at the store 'cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station 'cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station 'cause I slay
You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making 'cause I slay
I might just be a black Bill Gates in the making 'cause I slay
All this flavor I know they can't deny it
I know they can't deny it
He like to make me happy he give me lot of money
That's expensive as censored
All of this to impress me ah-ah-ah
I just want to get drunk and get freaky oh-oh-oh
I know I'm lyin' I'm not sober no no-oh

I'm the baddest chick the name's Minaj da—
Young Money is the roster and a monster too
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight wait I'm the rookie

But I was still staring at the titties though yeah
Low key or maybe high key

Yeah so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh yeah you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you

And I stand for everything and fall for nothin' oh


It ain't nobody else fuck you thinkin' Aubrey
I done got a little lean in my system
Fuck the witnesses I'm only guilty by association

I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Hater you know I
I'm bossed up I'm a big timer
Hater you know I
I pull up in that Lam' I'm a trend setter
Hater you know I
All them bitches they don't want none
Hater you know I


Uh fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick she's on a strict diet
That's my baby my nike we hangin' tight
She told me that she love me I said "Baby girl fall in line"
Okay sexy thinkin' murder me she gon' get it
I'm a champion short and simple tryna add a couple million to my net worth that's more digits
Used to bag work but now I'm makin' movie deals
Me and Nicki kickin' like it's judo real real
Them niggas write books and they ain't even read it
And all my niggas be robbin' like they gluten
I get it let's take the rich way out
You ain't got no gun they can't blame you if you ain't shoot it
But fuck that I'm all in her face
Like I'm makin' my confessions that this is the life that I chose
And the life chose me and you got a better chance of getting hit by lighting
Or a plane or a bullet let's go


It ain't nobody else fuck you thinkin' Aubrey
I done got a little lean in my system
Fuck the witnesses I'm only guilty by association

I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Hater you know I
I'm bossed up I'm a big timer
Hater you know I
I pull up in that Lam' I'm a trend setter
Hater you know I
All them bitches they don't want none
Hater you know I
