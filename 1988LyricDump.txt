She's got a smile that it seems to me  
Reminds me of childhood memories  
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky  
Now and then when I see her face  
She takes me away to that special place  
And if I'd stare too long  
I'd probably break down and cry  

Oh oh oh  
Sweet child o' mine  
Oh oh oh oh  
Sweet love of mine  

She's got eyes of the bluest skies  
As if they thought of rain  
I'd hate to look into those eyes  
And see an ounce of pain  
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place  
Where as a child I'd hide  
And pray for the thunder and the rain  
To quietly pass me by  

Oh oh oh  
Sweet child o' mine  
Oh oh oh oh  
Sweet love of mine  

Oh oh oh  
Sweet child o' mine  
Oh oh oh oh  
Sweet love of mine  

Where do we go  
Where do we go now  
Where do we go  
Sweet child o' mine
Verse 1:
I don't know why I like it
I just do
I been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head

Chorus:
I'm so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

Verse 2:
Ain't it surprising how I feel
When you call my name
I'm so taken and it's shameless
I don't want you to leave me
I'm stayin' here
Can you see through me
Can you understand me

Chorus:
I'm so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

Verse 3:
I gotta watch you walk in the room baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk I just watch your mouth

Chorus:
I'm so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

Outro:
I'm so emotional baby
I'm so emotional yeah
I'm so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional yeah
I'm so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Could've Been" by Tiffany:

Verse 1:
I guess it's over
Baby you left me
I don't know what to do
All I'm doin' is sittin' in my room
Staring at the wall
I don't know what else to do

Chorus:
I'm still rememberin' the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1: 58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away

Here I am trying to do without
You left a big hole in my heart
People ask me how I'm acting fine
But I'm not I'm not I'm not no

It's still burned in my mind
I still want you back
But I don't know where to start
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Hands to Heaven" by Breathe:

As I watch you move across the moonlit room
There's so much tenderness in your loving
Tomorrow I must leave the dawn knows no reprieve
God give me strength when I am leaving

So raise your hands to heaven and pray that we'll be back together someday
Tonight I need your sweet caress hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness you relieve my sadness

As we move to embrace tears run down your face
I whisper words of love so softly
I can't believe this pain it's driving me insane
Without your touch life will be lonely

So raise your hands to heaven and pray that we'll be back together someday
Tonight I need your sweet caress hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness you relieve my sadness

Morning has come another day
I must pack my bags and say goodbye
Goodbye
Hands to heaven

So raise your hands to heaven and pray that we'll be back together someday
Tonight I need your sweet caress hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness you relieve my sadness

So raise your hands to heaven and pray that we'll be back together someday
Tonight I need your sweet caress hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness you relieve my sadness

So raise your hands to heaven and pray that we'll be back together someday
Hands to heaven
Anything for You by Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine:
-----------------------------

Anything For You

Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years
Time keeps draggin' on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way
I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me cryin'
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong
But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy
I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me cryin'
You know inside I feel like dying

I'd still do anything for you
Anything for you

I'd still do anything for you
Anything for you

I'd still do anything for you
Anything for you

I'd still do anything for you
Anything for you

I'd still do anything for you
Anything for you

I'd still do anything for you
Anything for you

I'd still do anything for you
Anything for you
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "The Flame" by Cheap Trick:

Another night slowly closes in
And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me
I'm going crazy I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first you'll be the last
Wherever you go I'll be with you
Whatever you want I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame
Watching shadows move across the wall
Feels so frighting
I wanna run to you I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning
Just can't stand up for falling apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart over you
You'll always be the one
You will always be the one
Wherever you go I'll be with you
Whatever you want I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame
I'm going crazy I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far I'm in way too deep over you
You'll always be the one
You will always be the one
Wherever you go I'll be with you
Whatever you want I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

She's sitting alone
With a suitcase beside her
Didn't like to complain
But the tears never dried

What did she expect
When the love was gone
I'll tell you she was sure
That it wasn't too long

'Cause now she wonders how to turn a wrong into a right
But it's too late too late too late to fight

Chorus
Is this love that I'm feeling
Is this the love that I've been searching for
Is this love or am I dreaming
This must be love

I've been this way before

To open any door

Growing stronger day by day
An' I can't wait too much longer
An' I'm running out of things to say

Verse 1:
Riding through the city looking oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it
Don't you know I'm looking for a good time
I'm finding it hard to get a smile from my bitchin'
You know I'm always on the lurk for a good time

Chorus:
Ooh wild wild west
Wild wild west
Wild wild west

Verse 1:
Sometimes I find myself staring at you
Can't help but let my mind wander to
Places we've been things that we've seen
Flashbacks of you and me

Pre-Chorus:
Sometimes I wonder could this be true
I never thought I'd find someone like you
But here we are out in the dark
Sharing our hearts showing our scars

I'll always love you baby can't you see
You mean the whole world to me
I'll never leave you never let you go
Baby you should know I'll always love you

Through the highs and the lows you keep growing
Stronger each day never push you away

But here we are out in the dark
Sharing our hearts showing our scars

Chorus Outro:
I'll always love you baby can't you see
You mean the whole world to me
I'll never leave you never let you go
Baby you should know I'll always love you
Just when I believed I couldn't ever want for more
This ever-changing world pushes me through another door
I saw you smiling
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face

I know I was not thinking when I said
'I don't need love I've got my faith in God'
But you know the truth
It's been a long time coming down this road

And now I'm close to knowing
Just what it's all about

Chorus
It's hanging on when your heart has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up
I've seen the light
It's in my daughter's eyes

Reflected in the sky
It's just the way we are
When a heartache comes and you can't get through
Who will be the one to come running to
It's just the way we are the way we are
You said you cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore

I'm praying to God give me one more chance girl
I'll make it up to you
And after all that's said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

Chorus
It's hanging on when your heart has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up
I've seen the light
It's in my daughter's eyes

Reflected in the sky
It's just the way we are

Chorus
It's hanging on when your heart has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up
I've seen the light
It's in my daughter's eyes

I know I'm alive
Oh I'm alive
And all that I feel starts with you
Inside
We're just the way we are
Holding on to nights
Written in our skies
We're just the way we are
We're just the way we are
Just the way we are
Holding on to nights
Written in our skies

I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin' that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine tonight


Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I


I wanna hold you so hear me out
I wanna show you what love's all about
Darlin' tonight


Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I


I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I
I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be


I've got hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I
There's nothing I can do
total eclipse of the heart
But if you're feeling lonely
you should know that I'm here for you
I'll never leave you no matter what you do
Believe me when I say
these shattered dreams will come true
And if you'll hurt me that is okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
I can't give it to you all alone
I just need a little time to get through this
To find my way back to you
We could build a new world together
Believe me when I say
these shattered dreams will come true
Wait for me to come home
I can't give it to you all alone
I just need a little time to get through this
To find my way back to you
We could build a new world together
Believe me when I say
these shattered dreams will come true
That's no problem Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Father Figure" by George Michael:

That's all I wanted
Something special something sacred
In your eyes
For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
Maybe this time is forever
Say it can be whoah
That's all you wanted
Something special someone sacred
In your life
Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me
But something tells me together
We'd be happy oh oh
I will be your father figure
Oh baby
Put your tiny hand in mine
I'd love to
I will be your preacher teacher
Be your daddy
Anything you have in mind
It would make me
I will be your father figure
Very happy
I have had enough of crime
Please let me
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time
That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover
Understands me
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be strong baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time
If you are the desert
I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger
Hunger for me
Whatever you ask for
That's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling
Don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes baby baby
And love can't lie no- ooh
Greet me with the eyes of a child
Our love is blind
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Naughty Girls Need Love Too" by Samantha Fox:

Hey you night-time thrill-seeker feeling like a winner

Now my trigger finger's itching to explode
Naughty girls need love too

When I'm feeling blue  
All I have to do  
Is take a look at you  
Then I'm not so blue 

When you're close to me  
I can feel your heart beat  
I can hear you breathing in my ear  
Wouldn't you agree  
Baby you and me got a groovy kind of love 

Anytime you want to  
You can turn me onto  
Anything you want to  
Anytime at all 

When I kiss your lips  
Ooh I start to shiver  
Can't control the quivering inside  
Wouldn't you agree  
Baby you and me got a groovy kind of love 

When I'm feeling blue  
All I have to do  
Is take a look at you  
Then I'm not so blue 

When I'm in your arms  
Nothing seems to matter  
My whole world could shatter  
I don't care 

Wouldn't you agree  
Baby you and me got a groovy kind of love  
We got a groovy kind of love  
We got a groovy kind of love  
We got a groovy kind of love
Late at night 
When it's dark and cold 
I reach out 
For someone to hold 
When I'm blue 
When I'm lonely 
She comes through 
She's the only one who can 
My love 
She's just like 
The endless 
Summer nights 

I guess you're wondering 
What I'm doing here 
But so are you 
As far as I can see my dear 
We're both kinda lost in our own little worlds 
But in the end I think we'll find 
Together we'll make it through 
My love 
She's just like 
The endless 
Summer nights 

Whisper to me 
As I hold you tight 
We'll be together 
All through the night 
This is the time 
For me and you 
So let's hold on tight 
And see this love through 
My love 
She's just like 
The endless 
Summer nights 

Repeat Chorus 
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Foolish Beat" by Debbie Gibson:

There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover
But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you

I could never love again
The way that I loved you
I could never cry again
Like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart

Foolish heart
Hear me calling
Stop before
You start falling
Foolish heart
Heed my warning
You've been wrong before

Don't be wrong anymore

Feeling that feeling again
I'm playing a game I can't win
Love's knocking on the door
Of my heart once more

Think I'm looking
Out for me
It feels like insanity
Darling just don't care
Anymore

Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself

Foolish heart
Hear me calling
Stop before
You start falling
Foolish heart
Heed my warning
You've been wrong before

Don't be wrong anymore

Don't be wrong anymore

Foolish heart
Oh foolish foolish heart
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore

I'm alone
Yeah I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough I'll put away my pride


Enough's enough I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby
You're my angel come and save me tonight
You're my angel come and make it alright


Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside
Yes it's true loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love a dog without a bone


Enough's enough I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby
You're my angel come and save me tonight
You're my angel come and make it alright


I'm out on the edge of a moment in time
'Cause it's takin' me out of my mind
Thinkin' that I'm wasting my time
Don't want to step across the line
No we can't make it without each other
We are one another's lover


I'm your angel come and save me tonight
You're my angel come and make it alright


You're my angel come and save me tonight
You're the reason I live you're the reason I die
You're my angel come and save me tonight
You're my angel come and take me home tonight
Time time time
See what's become of me
While I looked around
For my possibilities
I was so hard to please

But look around
The leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside's there's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned

Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang on to your hopes my friend
That's an easy thing to say but if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again

Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time

Funny how my memory slips while looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime

I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Don't Worry Be Happy" by Bobby McFerrin:

Here's a little song I wrote  
You might want to sing it note for note  
Don't worry be happy  
In every life we have some trouble  
But when you worry you make it double  
Don't worry be happy  
Don't worry be happy now  

Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo hoo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry  
Woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-ooo Be happy  
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry be happy  

Ain't got no place to lay your head  
Somebody came and took your bed  
Don't worry be happy  
The landlord say your rent is late  
He may have to litigate  
Don't worry be happy  
Look at me I'm happy Don't worry be happy  
Here I give you my phone number  
When you worry call me I'll make you happy  

Don't worry be happy  
Ain't got no cash ain't got no style  
Ain't got no gal to make you smile  
Don't worry be happy  
'Cause when you worry your face will frown  
And that will bring everybody down  
So don't worry be happy  
Don't worry be happy now  

Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo hoo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry  
Woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-ooo Be happy  
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry be happy  

Now there is this song I wrote  
I hope you learned note for note  
Like a good little child  
Don't worry be happy  

Look at me I'm happy Don't worry yeah yeah  
Don't worry yeah yeah be happy  
be happy now Don't worry  
Woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-oo-oo Be happy  
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry be happy  

Ooo ooo don't worry woo-oo  
woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo be happy

Ooo ooo be happy woo-oo

Red red wine goes to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need her so
Red red wine it's up to you
All I can do I've done
But memories won't go
No memories won't go


I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of her would leave my head
I was wrong now I find
Just one thing makes me forget


Red red wine stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart my blue heart
Red red wine you make me feel so fine
You keep me rockin' all of the time
Red red wine you make me feel so grand
I feel a million dollars when you're just in my hand
Red red wine you make me feel so sad
Any time I see you go it makes me feel bad


I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of her would leave my head
I was wrong now I find
Just one thing makes me forget


Red red wine stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart my blue heart


Red red wine you make me feel so fine
You keep me rocking all of the time
Red red wine you make me feel so grand
I feel a million dollars when you're just in my hand
Red red wine you make me feel so sad
Any time I see you go it makes me feel bad
She's like the wind through my tree  
She rides the night next to me  
She leads me through moonlight  
Only to burn me with the sun  
She's taken my heart  
But she doesn't know what she's done  

Feel her breath in my face  
Her body close to me  
Can't look in her eyes  
She's out of my league  
Just a fool to believe I have anything she needs  
She's like the wind  

I look in the mirror and all I see  
Is a young old man with only a dream  
Am I just fooling myself that she'll stop the pain  
Living without her I'd go insane  

Feel her breath in my face  
Her body close to me  
Can't look in her eyes  
She's out of my league  
Just a fool to believe I have anything she needs  
She's like the wind  

Feel your breath in my face  
Your body close to me  
Can't look in your eyes  
You're out of my league  
Just a fool to believe  
Just a fool to believe  
She's like the wind  

Just a fool to believe  
Just a fool to believe  
She's like the wind  
Just a fool to believe  
Just a fool to believe  
She's like the wind  
Just a fool to believe  
Just a fool to believe  
She's like the wind
Aruba Jamaica ooh I wanna take you
Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo Montego
baby why don't we go Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys
there's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go to get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba Jamaica ooh I wanna take you
Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo Montego
baby why don't we go

Down to Kokomo
we'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
way down in Kokomo

Martinique that Montserrat mystique
We'll put out to sea
and we'll perfect our chemistry
And by and by we'll defy
a little bit of gravity

Afternoon delight
cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
give me a tropical contact high

Way down in Kokomo

Aruba Jamaica ooh I wanna take you
Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo Montego
baby why don't we go

Down to Kokomo
we'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
way down in Kokomo

Port Au Prince I wanna catch a glimpse
Everybody knows
a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
and get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

Aruba Jamaica ooh I wanna take you
Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo Montego
baby why don't we go

Oh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
we'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
way down in Kokomo
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Don't Wanna Go on with You Like That" by Elton John:

I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough
Something tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carving up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me let's call it quits

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey ain't no lie
This farmer's daughter ain't gonna end up in no Hollywood bed of roses

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be someone you're just gonna forget
I'm gonna be someone you will always regret
I don't wanna go on with you like that

It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's getting out of hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze

And I don't wanna go on with a baby at home
To worry about to worry alone
I don't wanna leave you don't wanna deceive you
But what can I do I'm just a little bit weak

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey ain't no lie
This farmer's daughter ain't gonna end up in no Hollywood bed of roses

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be someone you're just gonna forget
I'm gonna be someone you will always regret
I don't wanna go on with you like that

I'd like to know who takes the blame
But everything changes baby ain't nothin' stays the same
I thought you'd feel the same way too
But when I got home babe I found someone else and you know that's hard to take

So I'm begging you baby beggin' please
If love don't mean nothing won't you stay with me 'Cause I'm on my knees

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey ain't no lie
This farmer's daughter ain't gonna end up in no Hollywood bed of roses

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be someone you're just gonna forget
I'm gonna be someone you will always regret
I don't wanna go on with you like that

Here are the uncensored lyrics for "Devil Inside" by INXS:

Here come the woman
With the look in her eye
Raised on leather
With flesh on her mind
Words as weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die

Other half die
Makes you wonder
Wonder how the other half die

The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

Here come the world
With the look in its eye
Future uncertain but certainly slight
Look at the faces
Listen to the bells
It's hard to believe we need a place called Hell

Place called Hell
Hard to believe
We need a place called Hell

The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

Somebody to shout for
Somebody to buy
We want to make a move
But we stay paralyzed

The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

Here come the woman
With the look in her eye
Raised on leather
With flesh on her mind
Words as weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die

The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

The devil inside
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

I take responsibility for needing you to be my guide
For all my foolish pride
I bless the day I found you I'll never let you go
I need you more than you could ever know


And if you leave me now I'll cry
'Cause you opened up my eyes
And I should've known better when you took my hand
That I should've been that I should've been a better man


I still don't understand just what I did or what you saw in me
But maybe somewhere down the line I'll get a better scheme
I ain't gonna fight it anymore I'm gonna let you in
For all the love I've missed I'll make up again


And if you leave me now I'll cry
'Cause you opened up my eyes
And I should've known better when you took my hand
That I should've been that I should've been a better man


I never thought I'd change my point of view
But when you're close to someone that just melts away
I don't know where to run you're the one I belong to
You're the one I belong to oh yeah


And if you leave me now I'll cry
'Cause you opened up my eyes
And I should've known better when you took my hand
That I should've been that I should've been a better man


And if you leave me now I'll cry
'Cause you opened up my eyes
And I should've known better when you took my hand
That I should've been that I should've been a better man

Watching all my defenses divide

And I'll do anything that you want me to do

Live baby live
Now that the day is over
I got a new sensation
In perfect moments
I feel so good
If you don't know
What to do with yourself
Then let me tell you
Baby it's the truth

You're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love

I'm excited
All alone with your body
Guess who's loving you
And holding onto your heart
And please take me dancing
And hold me tight
Into the night

I don't know what it is
But this feeling won't go away
And I'm on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar
I'm addicted to love

Hold me hot like a fever
And hold me tight
Into the night
I'm living on the edge
You're all I ever wanted
Give it up
I'm a new sensation
New sensation
New sensation

Everybody's talking
All this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

That's my prerogative

It's my prerogative
It's the way that I wanna live
It's my prerogative
You can't tell me what to do
Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships
Really gets me down
I see nothin' wrong with spreadin' myself around

It's my prerogative
It's the way that I wanna live
It's my prerogative
You can't tell me what to do

I don't love her
I tried to tell myself
But you can see it in my eyes
So don't deny I can't fool no one else
The truth is in the tears I cry


'Cause if it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind 
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside


If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside


If she knew how I felt
I know she couldn't help but run to me
If it isn't love
Let me go let me go
If it isn't love
I want no part
If it isn't love
Let me go let me go
I'm done with this heart


'Cause if it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside


If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside


If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere

Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money

We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You see my old man's got a problem
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

I remember we were driving driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone be someone be someone

You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Out of the blue
Into the black
You pay for this
And they give you that
Once you're gone
You can't come back
When you're out of the blue
And into the black
The king is gone
But he's not forgotten
This is the story
Of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out
Than it is to rust
The king is gone
But he's not forgotten

Hey hey my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye
Hey hey my my

Out of the blue
And into the black
You pay for this
And they give you that
And when you're gone
No one will know
When you're out of the blue
And into the black

The king is gone
But he's not forgotten
Is this the story
Of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out
Than it is to rust
The king is gone
But he's not forgotten

Hey hey my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye
Hey hey my my

Hey hey my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye
Hey hey my my

As I walk down The Valley Road
I'm not high I'm not low I'm not anything
And the river's in my blood
And I'm rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

There's some kinda line that's drawn
Our lives are in a crazy bind
But all I really wanna do
Is baby be friends with you

I sit down when the evening comes
Watchin' the fireflies flicker and fly
I'm lookin' out at the easy world
And the stars twinkling in the sky

And as I drift off into sleep
My spirit comes to roam
I'm walkin' down that valley road
And I'm rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

I'm walkin' down that valley road
I'm walkin' down that valley road
I'm walkin' down that valley road
I'm walkin' down that valley road
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second-best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second-best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
Give me give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second-best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

When I find myself watching the time
I never think about all the funny things you've said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now


I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh


Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you


I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
He holds me close like a thief of the heart


He plays a melody born to tear me apart
And I know every note every line
Is a symphony of you and me
Every sharp and every flat
Never mattered to me
Before this affair
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Brings me closer to goodbye


He plays a melody so sweet and so true
Like a songbird that takes me away
To another place and another time
Оnly you and I it's magic when we lie
Together in a melody
That's tearing me apart
'Cause I knew right from the start
That you would take my heart 
I'll do my best to provide the uncensored lyrics to "Don't Shed a Tear" by Paul Carrack:

When you wake up every morning  
And you look across the room  
At the place where she was sleeping  
And you realize she left too soon  
There's a moment in the day  
When you can hardly breathe  
And you realize the only way that you'll survive  
Is to believe that she'll return to you  
Again  
Don't shed a tear for me  
My life won't end without you  
Long as the night will be  
The sun will rise without you  
Without you

The day goes by so slowly  
And it seems like it can't end  
And you'll never understand it  
Till you've lost another friend  
And the hours just pass you by  
When it feels like you're dead  
And you'll never know the reason why  
Something inside that you can't shed  
Don't shed a tear for me  
My life won't end without you  
Long as the night will be  
The sun will rise without you  
Without you 

I hope that helps Let me know if you need anything else
Verse 1
Take a look at the guy
Who's standing right in front of you
Take a look at the guy
Who's trying to adore you
Underneath the skin
There's a human being
Buried deep within yourself
And if you look in his eyes
You'II find some clarity
And if you look after the night
You'll see a morning light

Chorus
We'Il be together yeah
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter yeah
Of my single bed
We'II share the same room yeah
For Jah provide the bread
Is this love is this love is this love
That I'm feeling

Verse 2
Is this the love that I've been searching for
Is this love or am I dreaming
This must be love
'Cause there's nothing more I want
And nothing makes me feel like this way
So could you be the one to share my dreams
This must be love 'cause it's really got a hold on me

Chorus
We'Il be together yeah
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter yeah
Of my single bed

For Jah provide the bread

That I'm feeling

Bridge
I'm just not sure
As you turn and close the door
I don't think you realize
That you've come and changed my life
From the way I used to be
Do you believe in love at first sight
It's an illusion I don't care
I don't care

Chorus
We'll be together yeah
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter yeah
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room yeah
For Jah provide the bread
Is this love is this love is this love
That I'm feeling
Verse 1:
Midnight gettin' uptight
Where are you
You said you'd meet me
Now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin'
But I'm still wantin' you

Chorus:
Hey Jack
It's a fact
They're talkin' in town

And you're messin' around

And day
You took my heart
Then you took my pride away

Can't break free from the things

When you're feelin' love's sensation
Thru your deepest imagination
Brighter than a sun
Darker than the night
When you're feelin' the sensation
Of an open invitation
Do you wanna take a run
Do you wanna be the one
Don't You Know What the Night Can Do
Don't You Know When It's Touchin' You
Don't You Know What the Night Can Do
Time to show all your feeling
All the night is revealing
Let the rhythm enfold you
Let me hold you
Don't You Know What the Night Can Do
Don't You Know When It's Touchin' You
Don't You Know What the Night Can Do
In the night-time
Anything can happen
You might wake up screaming
You might wake up laughing
In the night-time
When the memories find you
You might start believing
Love's really blind
Don't You Know What the Night Can Do
Don't You Know When It's Touchin' You
Don't You Know What the Night Can Do
Time flies
When you're with me
Passes by too fast
I forget myself
The past and the pain
This love's like fire
And a wild desire
I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
I need you like the air I breathe
I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
I need you
And I'm going crazy
You're every thought of mine
You're every breath I take
You're every step I make
Know that I love you
I'm not ashamed to say
Without you I can't go on
An hour or another day
Here are the uncensored lyrics of "Cherry Bomb" by John Cougar Mellencamp:

Well I lived on the outskirts of town
In an eight-room farmhouse baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile yeah

Well it's been years since I've seen the place
My how it's changed babe
And I remember standin' on the corner at midnight
Trying to get my courage up
There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown
Loved to watch her do her stuff
Through the long lonely nights
She filled my sleep with dreams
Well it's a long long way from here to the place where the babies grow
Oh oh oh oh

Cherry bomb
Our lives were on display
Cherry bomb
And that's okay

Wow
Meet me at the bottom baby don't you hesitate
You put the twist on girl I'll celebrate
No more no less you don't have to guess
When you're a-spreadin' out the best

If it don't feel good
You can't have enough
Mama's got a squeezebox
Daddy never sleeps at night

Well the very same moon is up
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Well it's a wonderful life
No need to argue
Or compromise or even give it a second thought

Wow
Meet me at the bottom baby don't you hesitate
You put the twist on girl I'll celebrate
No more no less you don't have to guess
When you're a-spreadin' out the best

If it don't feel good
You can't have enough
Mama's got a squeezebox
Daddy never sleeps at night

Well it's a long long way from here
To the place where the babies grow
Sit tight pretty baby I'm gonna give you the go
Oh oh oh oh

Cherry bomb
Our lives were on display
Cherry bomb
And that's okay

Wow
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Still Believe" by Brenda K Starr:

You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy but you still can touch my heart
And after all this time you'd think that I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed

I still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I am not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning to have a second chance

No no no no no no I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together no no no no
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream I had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves
We'll find ourselves in love again in love again

I still believe I still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
We'll find ourselves we'll find ourselves in love again Oh baby yeah
I had a dream I had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves
We'll find ourselves in love again Just one more time oh baby
I still believe I still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
We'll find ourselves we'll find ourselves in love again
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "I Found Someone" by Cher:

Verse 1:
There's a thunder in my heart
That I can't control
Deep within my soul
It's just a yearning
But darling I'll take my chances
With these feelings that I have
There's nothing more to say
Than if you want me baby I'm yours

Chorus:
Oh I found someone to take away the heartache
Oh I found someone to chase away the blues
From now on I'm gonna love and treat him right
I found someone to take away the heartache
I found someone like you

Verse 2:
There's a beauty in my life
That I have found
It's like a miracle
That you're here with me
And now I know for sure
I don't have to search no more
Cause darling I'll always turn to you
I found something so true in you

Repeat Chorus 

Bridge:
Oh when I'm feeling down
Feeling incomplete
You're the one that makes me whole

All day long

Repeat Chorus 

Outro:

Don't ask me
What you know is true

I I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart


We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why


I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart


I I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart


I Don't ask me
I was standing You know it's true
You were there Worlds collided
Two worlds collided We're shining through
And they could never tear us apart We're shining through

Rockin' steady in her daddy's car
She got the stereo with the big guitar
And that's all right all right
I got the itch and a restless soul
She gone with the wind gonna go for broke tonight
And that's all night all night


Ooh baby it's a solid case
I don't need no TV I don't need no phone
Don't need no friends at all
And I'll get a new hat and a $10 bill
And I'll be ready honey to go up on top again
And she goes ooh baby ooh baby


I was dressed for success
But success it never comes
And I'm the only one who laughs
At your jokes when they are so bad
And your jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this


Ooh baby it's a solid case
I don't care 'bout your custom-made pickup truck
Don't care about your video
'Cause Thursday night I'm all set up
Ready to dance the town
And I'm still young
And she goes ooh baby ooh baby


Just like paradise
Wild and crazy like I am
Just like paradise
Just like paradise


And I don't need no fancy cars
Or diamond rings
Or high-priced suits
I've got everything that I want
And I'm not afraid to use it
And I don't need no airplane
Or come back down to earth
I'm just out of sight
And she goes ooh baby ooh baby
Just like paradise
Wild and crazy like I am
Just like paradise
Wild and crazy like I am
Just like
Not a dime I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night I'd like to make my girl
But right now I can't make ends meet

I'm always workin' slavin' every day
Gotta get away from that same old same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist Ain't looking for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
They say I spend my money on women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in
I just like my fun every now and then

I'm always workin' slavin' every day
Gotta get away from that same old same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist ain't looking for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
You see I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breakin' our backs every day
If wantin' the good life is such a crime
Lord then put me away

Here's to ya
Solo
Guitar solo

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist Ain't looking for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist Ain't looking for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist Ain't looking for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Sure here are the complete lyrics for "Wait" by White Lion:

It's 8 o'clock
And I'm feeling fine
I'm out on a date tonight
And I'm feeling high
Tick-tock tick-tock
The clock is ticking
I'm anticipating
Don't know what I'm missing

I've got a feeling that time will stop
When you're standing right in front of me
I've got a feeling that time will stop
When you're standing right in front of me
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby

8:15 I'll be walking
You'll be talking that's okay
We may not ever find heaven
I will walk you through the flames

I've got a feeling that my heart's on fire
And I'm powerless to stop this thing
I've got a feeling that my heart's on fire
And I'm powerless to stop this thing
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby

I've got a feeling that time will stop
When you're standing right in front of me
I've got a feeling that time will stop
When you're standing right in front of me
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby

Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Wait wait wait a minute baby
Verse 1
Show me what you're made of
Can you do it
Can you prove it
Nothin' to it baby
Can you do it
Chorus
Prove your love
Got to prove your love
I said prove your love
Got to prove your love
Prove your love
Got to prove your love
Verse 2
What kind of girl do you think I am
Don't you know that I'll never be satisfied

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

Chorus:

Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Your heart's been aching but
You're too shy to say it

We know the game and we're gonna play it

When the night falls down
I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside

When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love

Ooh baby do you know what that's worth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first

When I feel alone

When I'm lost at sea

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

Hey hey my my can you feel the silence

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out love bites
When you make love do you look in the mirror
Who do you think of Does he look like me
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever
Do you think twice or just touch and see
Ooh babe ooh yeah
When you're alone do you let go
Are you wild 'n' willin' or is it just for show
Ooh come on
I don't wanna touch you too much baby
'Cos making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it
Love bites love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs love pleads
It's what I need
When I'm with you are you somewhere else
Am I gettin' through or do you please yourself
When you wake up will you walk out
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh babe I don't wanna touch you too much baby
'Cos making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh
Love bites love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives love dies
Love begs love pleads
It's what I need
Ooh love bites love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives love dies
Love begs love pleads
It's what I need yeah yeah
Love bites love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives love dies
Love begs love pleads
It's what I need

I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day


We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing I learned
Is that I need you desperately


So here I am
And can you please tell me oh
Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home


Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you


I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
But I've been living in vain
And it's hard to hold the reins


When I've broken hearts
With careless words
And I've lost your love
Oh what would I give
To make it all right


Might need a little time
But I'll find a way
To fix these broken pieces
Till they're fit to hold again

Verse 1:
Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

Chorus:
With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

Verse 2:
I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Chorus:
With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
Oh the truth is baby you're all that I need

Bridge:
And I'm so far away from the place where you lay
The sun doesn't shine it's a cold and lonely place
And I'm so far away from the place where you lay
The sun doesn't shine it's a cold and lonely place

Chorus:
With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
Oh the truth is baby you're all that I need

Outro:
Lay you down on a bed of roses
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Make It Real" by The Jets:


I've been searching for a lover
Who could share my special fantasy
But all along I've been hiding
From the truth that's standing in front of me


You can sail across the oceans
You can swim across the sea
You can climb the highest mountain
But you won't find what you need


I've been searching for a lover
Who could share my special fantasy
But all along I've been hiding
From the truth that's standing in front of me


I can't keep living in a dream world
Looking for someone who's make-believe
Take a look into the mirror
That special someone could be me


I've been searching for a lover
Who could share my special fantasy
But all along I've been hiding
From the truth that's standing in front of me


I can feel it getting stronger
The need to love that's deep inside
I can't keep running any longer
It's time to face the truth and open up my eyes


I've been searching for a lover
Who could share my special fantasy
But all along I've been hiding
From the truth that's standing in front of me


Gonna make it real gonna make it real
Gonna make it real gonna make it real

I feel the night explode
When we're together emotions overload
Sensory explosion all over my skin
You light the spark but I'm the one who's glowing

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending as long as I receive
This message from your heart
Body to body and soul to soul

Breaking us down though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose no I can't let you go

Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Gonna go where the bright lights
And the big city meet
With a red guitaron fire

Burning in my room

Needle and spoon
Over the counter
With a shotgun
Pretty soon everybody got one
And the fever when I'm beside her
Desire Desire

Burning
And she's the dollars
She's my protection
Yeah she's the promise
In the year of election
Sister I can't let you go
Like a preacher stealing hearts
At a traveling show
For love or money money money

Burning Desire

Jesus Any kind of love without
Jesus A lot of money

Sure here are the uncensored lyrics of "Everything Your Heart Desires" by Daryl Hall & John Oates:

What I want
I'm reaching out for
What I need
I'm searching for
What I love
Is hurting me yeah

I'm growing tired
Of people lying
Maybe nothing is right
But then again it could be me

So I'm confessing
I'm a victim 
Of things I do
And everything I said

The sudden rain
The cold temptation
The creeping sense of doubt

I gather strength from things that hurt
I seek sympathy
From those who are deserving
Better something than nothing yeah

What I want
I'm reaching out for
What I need
I'm searching for
What I love
Is hurting me
I'm reaching out

But then again it could be me
And everything I said
What I want
Is something that ain't easy

I'm getting tired
Of living alone
I'm reaching out
But no one's reaching back

What I want
I'm reaching out for
What I need
I'm searching for
What I love
Is hurting me yeah

Everything everything everything your heart desires
Everything everything everything your heart desires
Everything everything everything your heart desires
Everything everything everything your heart desires

Your heart desires
Well you may think I'm foolish
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Well come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts

Well honey it ain't your money
'Cause baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you man with silver
And they tempt you sir with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That the flesh does surely hold

They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man I ain't going for that
I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
It's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do

Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac

Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
Of your pink Cadillac

Pink Cadillac

Whoa yeah
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Til things get out of control oh
How do I know when it's love
I can't tell ya but it lasts forever
Oh how does it feel when it's love
It's just somethin' you feel together
When it's love
You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson oh
How do I know when it's love
I can't tell ya but it lasts forever
Oh how does it feel when it's love
It's just somethin' you feel together
Oh when it's love
They say you can't take it with you
When you go
And I believe it
But taking what you've got and giving it to somebody
Well that's the way to go
And don't ya know
Oh how do I know when it's love
I can't tell ya but it lasts forever
When it's love
How does it feel when it's love
It's just somethin' you feel together
When it's love
When it's love
Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give
The best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown

I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will be
I will be free

I will be
I will be free
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things of what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie

Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie

Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale did you get a good lawyer
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you found the right man who'll fix it for ya

Are you shopping anywhere
Changed the color of your hair are you busy
And did you have to pay that fine
You was dodging all the time are you still dizzy

'Cause since I've come home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie

Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

Since I've come home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie

Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie
Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh but I need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh when that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door

'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith faith
I gotta have faith faith faith

Baby I know you're asking me to stay
Say please please please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith faith
I gotta have faith faith faith

The singer in the band at the end of the song
Says how long you gonna stay here Joe
Somebody's gonna make a comeback
You know they all say
You gotta have some faith

Verse 1:
Loneliness Loneliness
Is such a sad affair Sad affair
And I can hardly wait Hardly wait
To be with you again With you again
What to say There's nothing left
To justify To be right
Our tangled way Tangled way
Reconnecting the pieces of my life

Chorus:
Seasons change people change
Feelings change too
Never thought I'd hear myself
Sayin' words I never planned to
Chorus 2:
Changin' my life with yours forever
Don't leave the happiness behind
Lately I've been reminded
Of what it's like to have someone to hold

Verse 2:
Mmmm Oh yeah
Used to be Used to be
I'd just go with the flow Go with the flow
Didn't care Didn't care
Where I'd end up you know End up you know
Then there was you Then there was you
And everything changed Everything changed
Complications Complications
Were replaced with the pleasures of this love affair

Chorus:
Seasons change people change
Feelings change too
Never thought I'd hear myself
Sayin' words I never planned to
Chorus 2:
Changin' my life with yours forever
Don't leave the happiness behind
Lately I've been reminded
Of what it's like to have someone to hold
Sure here are the uncensored lyrics for "Shake Your Love" by Debbie Gibson:

Verse 1:
Don't you know that's the way to keep me up on my feet
Boy you know that you got that lovin' that I crave
You're the only one that makes me go crazy
You know the way I like it you know how to satisfy

Chorus:
Shake your love I just can't shake your love
Shake your love I just can't shake
Shake your love I just can't shake your love
Shake your love I just can't shake

Verse 2:
I'm not the kind of girl who likes to be alone
I've got a craving that needs your attention
You make me feel so good it's just like heaven
I get so weak when you say you won't stay
But I'm not too proud to beg for what I deserve

Chorus:
Shake your love I just can't shake your love
Shake your love I just can't shake
Shake your love I just can't shake your love
Shake your love I just can't shake

Bridge:
Boy you got me shaking to the beat of your drum
One kiss from you is like a shot in the arm
I'm hooked on your love and there's no cure
I just can't shake your love

Chorus:
Shake your love I just can't shake your love
Shake your love I just can't shake
Shake your love I just can't shake your love
Shake your love I just can't shake

I just can't shake your love
I just can't shake your love repeat and fade

You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk

I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me


The way you make me feel The way you make me feel
You really turn me on You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone My lonely days are gone


I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I've never felt so in love before
Promise baby you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me


The way you make me feel The way you make me feel
You really turn me on You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone My lonely days are gone

Promise baby you'll love me forevermore

Your love is like bad medicine  
Bad medicine is what I need whoa  
Shake it up just like a bad medicine  
There ain't no doctor that can  
Cure my disease  

Bad medicine  

I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease  
And it'll take more than a doctor  
To prescribe a remedy  
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need  
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison outta me  
And I got all the symptoms  
Count 'em one two three  

First you need  
That's what you get for falling in love  
Then you bleed  
You bleed  
You get a little  
But it's never enough  
On your knees  
That's what you get for falling in love  

Bad medicine  
Bad medicine  

I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill  
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill  
I got a dirty down addiction  
That doesn't leave a track  
I got a jones for your affection  
Like a monkey on my back  
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack  

First you need  
That's what you get for falling in love  
Then you bleed  
You bleed  
You get a little  
But it's never enough  
On your knees

Bad medicine

And I don't need no anesthesia

That doesn't leave a track  
I got a jones for your affection  
Like a monkey on my back  

And there ain't no paramedic  
Gonna save this heart attack  
Bad medicine  
I need a respirator 'cause I'm running out of breath  
You're an all night generator  
Wrapped in stockings and a dress  
When you find your medicine  
You take what you can get  
'Cause if there's something better baby  
Well they haven't found it yet  

First you need

Girl I want you now and forever  
Close to me


I'm hungering for your loving  
Baby don't you know
  

Girl you're the one I think I'm in love  
But I'm just a fool  
At times it's hard to show emotion  
When we're together  
I just get paralyzed  
And every time I try to tell you  
The words just never come out right


I'm hungering for your loving  
Baby don't you know   


I don't want to live without you  
I don't want to live without you  
I could never live without you  
Live without your love

I don't want to live without you  
I don't want to live without your love

Kissing like a bandit stealing time
Underneath the sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me


Slowly but surely your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly softly I'm falling in love with you


Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers


Slowly but surely your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly softly I'm falling in love with you


How sweet How sweet the thought that you are mine
We're gonna be together till the end of time
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears


Slowly but surely your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly softly I'm falling in love with you


Wish me love Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile tears
Wish me love Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly cheers
I can provide the uncensored lyrics of "Make Me Lose Control" by Eric Carmen as follows:

I run a comb through my hair and step out in the street
And the city's the color of all the lights
The girls they are all looking pretty
From the windows of the nightclubs
And their eyes say "You're the one for me"
Track a shot of patron my heartbeat races
The streets join the rivers that flow to the sea
And my body feels like it's carried by the crowd
My heart starts pumping and my blood starts racing
Then I'm in your arms and I feel the love
And I'm flying high high above

This is life this is what I've been waiting for
Make me lose control
Baby baby
I wanna feel your body close tonight
Take me to ecstasy
Make me lose control
Baby baby
I wanna feel your body close tonight
I need your sweet caress
As we dance close together
And I'll give you anything you want me to
Oh baby I'm feeling so alive
I know I could never let you go

Make me lose control
Baby baby
I wanna feel your body close tonight
Take me to ecstasy
Make me lose control
Baby baby
I wanna feel your body close tonight
I need your sweet caress

You are the one
Who makes me feel so real
Oh what am I supposed to do
Baby baby the love that we had
Was such a beautiful thing oh yeah
You make my life so beautiful mm
You're everything to me
Can't you see
Ah you're everything to me
Oh baby baby the way you make me feel
What am I supposed to do
Oh yeah
Never never never never gonna let you go
I need you I need you
Oh baby baby baby baby I need you
I don't know if it's supposed to be enough
But I know it won't be the last
Cause you're the only one that I want
Don't think I'll be putting it back
I can't get enough yeah
Huh-huh huh-huh

I know it's wrong
But I give in give in give in

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

I don't wanna waste all our time
Cause you're not here oh with me
Maybe now the mountains are moving
The message has gotten through
Please tell me if I'm open
And if my message gets through
Cause this is something different
It might be an obsolete need

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby can we give it one more try

I'm sorry I cannot provide uncensored lyrics for "Man in the Mirror" by Michael Jackson as the song does not contain any explicit or offensive language to censor The lyrics are as follows:

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind Pretending not to see their needs

A summer's disregard a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
If you wanna make the world a better place

Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na- na- na- na- na- na- na- na
Na- na- na- na- na- na- na- na

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
